you can say it in front of alex. she knows the whole story anyway. sometimes when you see someone from afar... ...you develop a fantasy. then when you see them up close, nine times out of ten, you wish you hadn't. i have no idea what you're talking about. i was confused, so i went back to her apartment, and... ...thought i'd find what i was looking for, but i found something else. did you talk to her? just long enough for her to convince me that she's a liar. no harm, no foul, though, right? what do you think, alex? i mean, you know the whole story. it's easy to stand back and judge. you don't know anything about this woman. i know that she has no conscience and no regard for anyone but herself. i mean, what else do i need to know? you make yourself into such a victim. nobody made you be with her. you can't even see what a hypocrite you're being. i'm being a hypocrite? how am i being a hypocrite? yes, you are! whoa, whoa, whoa. you guys. hey, relax. no, luke. hey, hold on. alex, i'd like you to explain to me how i'm being a hypocrite. who's to say this woman hasn't been in love with you for a really long time? and now that she found you again, she wasn't about to let you go twice. what? maybe... the first time she saw you, maybe she felt the way you did the first time you saw lisa. you remember that. love makes you do crazy things. insane things. things in a million years you never thought you'd see yourself do. there you are doin' it. can't help it. jesus christ. lighten up, you guys. this woman... she's a nut. she's psycho. she's cuckoo-bananas, all right? end of story. can we change the subject? i actually have something to cheer you up. did you, uh, leave a note with the bartender here a few days ago? yeah, i did. how do you know that? 'cause lisa called. what? yeah! after you got off the phone. she said to meet her at 3:00. she couldn't wait long, 'cause she had to get on a plane to london. w-where am i supposed to meet her? she didn't say. she said you'd know. you don't know? i think you know where. it hasn't been that long, has it? what? you know, uh... i'll ask tony. maybe he'll know something. you knew she was here the whole time? this belongs to you. it's from her. "matt. please don't think that i'm running away from you. "i was so overwhelmed when you asked me to move in. "i couldn't speak. "my answer. of course. is yes. i love you. and can't wait to come home.
