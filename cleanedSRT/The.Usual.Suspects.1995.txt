how you doin', keaton? i can't feel my legs, keyser. ready? what time is it? 12.30. it all started back in new york six weeks ago. a truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of queens. the driver saw nobody, but somebody fucked up. he heard a voice. sometimes that's all you need. new york city mr mcmanus? christ, don't you fuckin' guys ever sleep? we have a warrant for your arrest. fuck you, pig. todd hockney? who wants to know? new york police department. shit. freeze! hold it! sure you brought enough guys? it's quite simple. a restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic. in other words, the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls. where will it be? let me give you an example. this i had to see for myself. david. i'm in a meeting. time for another one. everyone, this is david kujan. special agent kujan, us customs. these gentlemen are from the new york police department. you look good, keaton. better than i would have thought. il y a un problme? a small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns. mr keaton? will you excuse us for a moment? we have some questions to ask you downtown. peut-tre nous vous laisserions... no, no, no, please. please sit down. this is... this is a small problem. enjoy the meal. i'll talk to you later. ok. qu'est-ce qui s'est pass l? non, c'est pas du tout un problme. c'est la police, n'est-ce pas? a a l'air. a va. unique. oui! it didn't make sense that i'd be there. i mean, these guys were hard-core hijackers. but there i was. at that point i wasn't scared. i knew i hadn't done anything they could do me for. besides, it was fun. i got to make like i was notorious. when your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given. number one, step forward. hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker. number two, step forward. give me the fucking keys, you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker... knock it off! get back! number three, step forward. in english, please. excuse me?

hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker. this has really gotta be embarrassing for you guys, huh? they drilled us all night. somebody was pissed about that truck getting hijacked. they were hoping somebody would give them something to go on. they knew we wouldn't fight it because they knew how to lean on us. our rights went out the window. it was a violation. disgraceful. they went after mcmanus first - a top-notch entry man. what truck? the truck with the guns, fucko. fucko? he was a good guy. crazy though. wanna know what fenster told us? say who? mcmanus! he told us another story. oh, is that the one about the hooker with dysentery? fenster always worked with mcmanus. he was a tight-ass, but when it came to the job he was right-on a smart man. what are you saying? i said he'll flip you. he'll what? flip you. flip you for real. ok. answer my question. can you hear me in the back? hello? i want my lawyer. i'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker. todd hockney. good with explosives. without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody. you don't have a fucking leg to stand on. you think so? i could put you in queens on the night of the hijacking. really? i live in queens. did you put that together yourself, einstein? got a team of monkeys workin' on this? you know what happens if you do another turn in the joint? fuck your father in the shower, then have a snack. you gonna charge me? when i'm ready. with what? you know damn well, dead man. but keaton was the real prize for them, for obvious reasons. it was your mistake, not mine. did you ever stop to ask me? hm? i mean, i've been walking around with the same face, the same name. i'm a business man. what's that, the restaurant business? from now on you're in the getting-fucked-by-us business. i'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker. like i said, it was your mistake. not mine. now, you charge me with this shit and i'll beat it. ok? let's get back to the truck, asshole. argh! should do something about this shit. so i did a little time. does that mean i get railed every time a truck finds its way... fuck 'em! fenster, will you relax? these guys don't have any probable cause. you're fucking-a right. no pc. no goddamn right. you do some time, never let you go. they treat me like a criminal. i'll end up a criminal. you are a criminal! now, what you gotta go and do that? i'm tryin' to make a point. why don't you make your point? you're makin' me tired all over. well, fuck it then. i heard you were dead. oh, yeah? well, you heard right. word i got is you hung up your spurs, man. what's that all about? rumour has it keaton's gone straight. i hear he's tapping edie finneran. who's that? a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown. i hear she's keaton's meal ticket. how about it, keaton? you a lawyer's wife? what kind of retainer are you givin' her? whoops! hey, fenster, do your friend a favour. tell him to keep quiet. dean keaton. gone clean, huh? say it ain't so. or was it you that hit that truck? mac, mac, forget him. did you get to talk to your lawyer? this whole thing was a shakedown. what makes you say that? how many times you been in a line-up? it's always you and four dummies. pd pay homeless guys $10 a head half the time. and there's no way they'd line five felons in the same row. and a voice line-up? a public defender can get you outta that one. so why the hell was i strip-searched? that was the feds. truckload of guns get snagged. customs comes down on nypd wanting answers. they come up with us. they're clutching at straws. i had a guy's finger up my asshole. is it friday already? yeah, lover boy. you want a piece? so who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck? who stole the fucking truck? i don't want to know. who asked you, working man? fuck who did it! i wanna know who's the gimp. how do i know that? what about it? what's your story? his name is verbal. verbal kint. verbal? yeah. roger really. people say i talk too much. i was just gonna tell you to shut up. we met before once or twice. in county. i was in for fraud. a line-up then, too. what happened? i walked. 90 days, suspended. so you did it! all right, now, look. we've all been put out by this whole thing, right? so i figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity, hm? now, me and fenster heard about a little job. why don't you just calm down? what do you care what he has to say? i'm just talkin' here. it seems like mr hockney wants to hear what i got to say. i know fenster's down. what about you, guy? i'm interested. sure. there, see? so now i'd like to exercise my right to free assembly. why don't you just shut up? you're missing the point. no. you're missing the point. i don't wanna hear anything from you. i don't care about your job. and, um, i want nothing to do with any of you. i beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell. dean keaton, gone the high road. what is the world coming to? fuck him. that was how it started. five men brought in on a trumped-up charge to be leaned on by halfwits. ok. now i really can't talk about it much here... what the cops never figured out, and what i know now, was that these men would never break, never lie down, never bend over for anybody. anybody. san pedro who are you? agent jack baer, fbi. how many dead? 15 so far. they're still pulling bodies out of the water though. any survivors? yeah, two. one guy's in county hospital, but he's in a coma. the da has a second guy, a cripple from new york, i think. the chief wants this place sealed off. if you have any questions, give him a call. this is dave kujan. i'll be in los angeles until tuesday. if you need to reach me, call jeff rabin of the san pedro pd on extension 112. have a nice day. why can't i see him? dave, i told you. the da came last night ready to arraign even before they moved him to county. kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later, da comes out the office looking like he'd been smacked around. they take his statement and they cut him a deal. did they charge him with anything? yeah, weapons. misdemeanour two. what is that? listen, i give the da credit for getting that much. understand? excuse me, sir. this whole thing has turned political. the mayor was here last night. the chief. this morning the governor called, ok? i'm telling you this guy is protected from up on high by the prince of darkness. take my word for it. when does he post bail? two hours, tops. i wanna see him. no, dave. i gotta see him. dave, no! i cannot do this for you. you gotta. i came a long way for this. dave, please. even if i let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. he's paranoid. he knows the interrogation rooms are all wired. i quit. this won't be an interrogation. just a friendly chat. he will not go in the interrogation room. someplace else. where? no, no, no, no, no... if it was a dope deal, where's the dope? lf it was a hit, who called it in? i'm sure you have a host of wild theories. they know damn well what i think. that's crazy! besides, the guy's got total immunity. his story checks out. he doesn't know what you wanna know. i don't think he does. not exactly. but there's more to his story. jeffrey, look, i wanna know why 27 men died on that pier for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there. and, above all, i wanna be sure dean keaton's dead. he's dead. come on. two hours. just till he makes bail. they're all dead. i don't care how tough a guy you say keaton was, nobody on that boat could have come out alive. is he talking? he just regained consciousness. he spoke... not english, then he lapsed. hungarian. might have been. most were hungarians. you gotta put on one of these. burn victims are susceptible to infection. and, of course, there's no smoking. keep your mask up. please don't touch him. is he gonna die? he has burns over 60% of his body. a number of ribs are broken. call security. put a man on the door. is he dangerous? yes. do it. do it now! joel? yeah, baer down at la county. look, the guy they pulled out of the harbour is arkosh kovash. yes. yes. i'm sure. no, he's all fucked up. what? what? i can't hear you. will you shut up? i'm on the phone. yes? well, not until i put a man on him. send me someone who can speak hungarian. yeah, he's talking like a thai hooker. keyser sze! what? keyser sze! keyser sze! no shit. joel. yeah, call dan metzheiser at justice and find dave kujan from customs. mm-hm. verbal, this is agent kujan from customs. nice to meet you. he wants to ask you a few questions. what about? about a dean keaton mostly. but i'd like to start at the line-up in new york. can i get coffee? in a while. let's talk about the line-up. i'm really thirsty. i used to dehydrate as a kid. one time i got so bad, my piss come out like snot. it was thick... i'll get your fucking coffee. get me one too while you're at it. that guy is tense. tension is a killer. i was in a barbershop quartet in skokie, illinois. the baritone was a guy named kip diskin. big, fat guy. i mean, like, orca fat. he was so stressed in the morning... verbal, we're trying to help you. sure. and i appreciate that. and i wanna help you, agent kujan. i like cops. i would have liked to have been a fed myself, but... verbal, you're not telling us everything. i know you know something. verbal, i know you like keaton. i know you think he's a good man. he was a corrupt cop. sure, 15 years ago, but he was a good thief. anyway, cops wouldn't let him go legit. dean keaton was a piece of shit! are you trying to get a rise out of me, agent kujan? i just wanna hear your story. it's all there. may i have a cigarette? according to your statement... i need a light. according to your statement, you're a short-con operator. run-of-the-mill... according to your statement, you're a short-con operator. run-of-the-mill scams. it's been suppressed. it's inadmissible. oh, i know. sweet deal you have here. total immunity. well, i do have the weapons charge. i'm looking at six whole months' hard time. you know a dealer named ruby deemer, verbal? know a religious guy named john paul? you know ruby's in attica? he didn't have my lawyer. i know ruby. he's big on respect. he's a good friend of mine, likes me very much. i know your testimony is sealed. ruby has a lot of friends inside do favours for him. what do you think he'd say if he found out you dropped his name to the da? there's nothing in there about ruby. i'll mention that to him. first thing on the job i learnt how to spot a murderer. say you arrest three guys for the same killing and put 'em in jail. next day whoever's sleeping is your man. if you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest. you follow me? no. let me get right to the point. i'm smarter than you and i'm gonna find out what i wanna know. and i'm gonna get it from you whether you like it or not. i'm not a rat. thanks. when i was picking beans in guatemala, we'd make fresh coffee right off the trees. that was good. this is shit, but, hey, i'm in a police station... can we get started again? now, what happened after the line-up? the desk sergeant told me he couldn't release you. can you believe that? you weren't even charged! new york police. i want pictures taken of your face. i'll take 'em to the da first thing. forget about it. no! i'll have this in front of a grand jury! look, i don't wanna talk about it, edie. ok? so what did fortier and renault say? they need more time to think about it. dammit! more time for what, edie? no matter how you cover my tracks, they'll still find out about me. give me some credit. i got you this far. let's go to the grand jury. it won't stop! look, it's never gonna stop, period! by next week every investor in the city's gonna be walkin' away from us. it's finished. i'm finished. don't give up on me now, dean. it's never gonna stop. i love you. they ruined me in there tonight. i love you. do you hear me? what? all right. let's just go to my place. let's go. fenster and mcmanus had a cagey proposition. a fast jump, high risk, long money. we all knew it could be done. the way i figured, to do it wrong meant killing. to do it right took five men. five men meant keaton. keaton took convincing. new york's finest taxi service. bullshit. bullshit. they don't operate any more. mcmanus has a friend in the 14th precinct. they're coming out for one job. they're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds. mcmanus already has a fence. a fence? who? some guy in california named redfoot. i never heard of him. you have to come. what's it to you whether i do it or not? they don't know me. you do. they won't take me unless you go. look at me. i need this. oh, you're telling me you don't need this? is this your place? i'm not knocking you. you got a good scam going with this lawyer... oh! sorry. it's ok. it's ok. you say it's the real thing, that's cool. you ok? i was outta line. but they're never gonna stop with us. you know that. as clean as you could get, they'll never let you go. this way we hit the cops where it hurts and we get well in the meantime. you sure you're ok? i'll be all right. look, i, uh... i sometimes get... forget it. i'll probably shit blood tonight. so, uh... how do they wanna do it? mcmanus wants to go in shooting. i say no. fenster? hockney? they're pretty pissed off. they'll do anything. i got a way to do it without killing anyone, but they won't let me in without you. three million? maybe more. no killing? not if we do it my way. new york's finest taxi service was not your normal service. it was a ring of corrupt cops in the nypd that ran a high-profit racket driving smugglers and drug dealers round the city. for a few hundred dollars a mile you got your own police escort. they even had business cards. after a while somebody started asking questions and the service shut down. since then internal affairs have been waiting to catch them in the act. that's where we came in. so, how was the flight? fucking great. will this get me to staten island? you kidding me? this'll get you to cape cod. mcmanus brought us the job. fenster got the vans, hockney supplied the hardware. i came up with how to do it so no one got killed. but keaton? keaton put on the finishing touch. a little "fuck you" from the five of us to the nypd. all right, watch this, watch this. whoa, whoa. careful, careful! come on, asshole! fuck! holy shit! don't move, you fuckers! drop it now, motherfucker. hurry up! drop it! don't fuckin' move! what do you want? a buckshot shampoo, chubby? afternoon, pork chops. give me the shit. give him the fuckin' shit! give him the fuckin' thing! give him the fuckin' shit, man! hurry up! come on! now the money. there's no money. give me the money! there's no fuckin' money! give me it! give me the fuckin' money! give him the money! give me the money! give him the money! motherfucker! you know who the fuck i am? you people know who the fuck i am? fuck! wait a minute. what's that? what the fuck...? holy shit! keaton made an anonymous phone call. the press arrived before the police did. strausz and rizzi were indicted three days later. within a few weeks 50 more cops went down with them. everybody got it right in the ass from the chief on down. it was beautiful. i owe you $2.50. dr keaton. there's more here than i thought. when's the fence coming? redfoot never comes to see me. i always go to see him. in california? yes, verbal. in california. fenster and i... wait. hold the fuckin' phone. you and fenster? no, no, no, no, no. you fuckin' kiddin' me? ok, so everyone's gonna go. we all go. what's your fuckin' problem, man? my fuckin' problem is that you and fenster are off in california while we're sittin' here holdin' our dicks! hey! the job's over. cool it. la's a good place to lie low for a while. you wanna dance? ladies... i would like to propose a toast. there you go. to mr verbal. the man with the plan. don't do this. send her a note, something. i said we'll make it. we're gonna miss the plane. she'll understand. that's heart-warming. really. i'm weepy. jeff, you wanna wait outside? you guys wanted to know what happened after the line-up. come on, verbal. who do you think you're talkin' to? you expect me to believe that he retired? for a woman? bullshit. keaton was using her. he loved her. sure. i'm supposed to believe hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea? that was all fenster and mcmanus. keaton was a cop for four years. but edie had him turned around. let me tell you something. i know dean keaton. i've been investigating him for the past three years. the guy i know was a cold-blooded bastard. iad indicted him on three murder counts before he was kicked off the force. so don't sell me the hooker with a heart. you got him all wrong. do i? keaton was under indictment a total of seven times while he was on the force. in every case the witnesses either reversed their testimony, or died before they could testify. when they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in sing sing. he killed three prisoners inside. of course, i can't prove this. but i can't prove the best part either. dean keaton was dead. did you know that? he died in a fire two years ago during an investigation into the murder of a witness who was going to testify against him. two people saw dean keaton walk into a warehouse he owned before it blew up. they said he went in to check a leaking gas main. it blew up and took all of dean keaton with it. within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead. one killed himself in his car, the other fell down an open elevator shaft. agent baer... get this show on the road. there are too many people here. doctor, we'll be out of here before he blows his porch light. i have a noon meeting. five minutes. everyone, calm down, all right? i want you to ask this man about the shoot-out in the harbour. he says they were buying... dope. we know. he doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope. uh, people. what? he needs guarantees. what is he talking about? he says his life's in danger. he saw the devil, looked him in the eye. i'm on my way. no, no, no. wait a minute. ask him to tell him what he told me... about the devil. who's the devil? keyser sze. keyser sze? he was in the harbour killing many men. he saw keyser sze? he saw his face. tell him to tell her what he looks like. describe him. ok. an anonymous call tells me i can find keaton at mondino's with his attorney. and there he is. because he never profited from his alleged death and we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him, we had to let him go. he was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over, and then he had lunch. i don't know about that. oh, i don't think you do. but you say you saw keaton die. you're covering his ass and he's still out there. i think he's behind that whole circus at the harbour. he's using you cos you're stupid. you tell me he's dead, so be it. i wanna be sure he is before i go back to new york. he wasn't behind anything. it was the lawyer. what lawyer? what lawyer, verbal? when i was in that barbershop quartet... i know you held out on the da! what did you leave out of that testimony? i can call up ruby in ten minutes! the da gave me immunity. not from me. you get no immunity from me, you piece of shit. every criminal i've put in prison, every cop that owes me a favour, every creep that walks the street for a living will know the name of verbal kint. now you talk to me, or that immunity they seem so fit to grant you won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on. there was a lawyer. kobayashi. is he the one that killed keaton? no. but i'm sure keaton is dead. convince me. and tell me every last detail. we arrived in los angeles and met mcmanus's fence, redfoot. he had a good reputation. seemed like a good guy. still, we should've known better. how you doin'? good. you? not bad. can't complain. how's it goin', fenster? don't need to open it, right? you must be keaton. redfoot, dean keaton, todd hockney and verbal kint. verbal. the man with the plan, huh? interested in any more work? we're always lookin' for extra work. we're on vacation. well, that's too bad. i got a ton of work and i don't have any good people like you guys. what's the job? a jeweller out of texas named saul. he rents a suite in some downtown hotel. he does free appraisals for people. anyway, the word is he carries around a lot of cash. so i figure i keep the merchandise, you keep the green. simple. what about security? bodyguards. nothing you can't handle. give me time to check it out? i'd expect nothing less from you, man. good to see you. we'll call you. enjoy la, huh? get yourself laid. hey, uh... a friend of mine in new york tells me that you know, that you knew spook hollis. the way i hear it, you did time with old spook. good man, wasn't he? i used to run dope for him. too bad he got shieved. yeah. i shieved him. better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later. i appreciate that. just out of curiosity, was it business or personal? a bit of both. well, like i said, you give me a call if you're interested, all right? is there a problem? one job. that was the deal. one job! that's a good one, keaton. keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is. he can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself. it took one day with mcmanus nagging him, and we went back to work. so, i get out of my car. i think it's wrecked. in the back seat of the other car, this woman's totally naked! i'm laughin' so hard, i can't breathe. get in the car, saul. freeze! freeze! there's a second one here somewhere. give me the case. give me the fuckin' case! give me the case. i'm telling you for the last time, give me the fuckin' case! look, just hand over the case. hand over the fuckin' case! come on! bad day. fuck it. let's go! let's go! let's go! fuck! a lot of china to me. shit. guys, come on. what're you doin'? i'm gonna kill him. we did it your way, now my way. you gonna kill him? i'm gonna deal with it. you better. i'm gonna deal with it. shut up! what am i supposed to do with that? feed it to the gimp, ease his pain. i don't know what it is. what do you mean? sh! i don't know. i got this job from a lawyer. yeah, who? i don't know. some limey. he's a middle man for somebody, ok? he doesn't say, i don't ask. you're fuckin' full of shit! fuck you! fuck you! listen to me! we wanna meet him, ok? that's funny. he called me last night. he says he wants to meet you guys. ok. we'll meet him. i'll call you. good. do that. no problem. i don't like it, dean. wait. one more thing, tough guy. any more surprises and i'm gonna kill you. such a tough guy, mcmanus. do me a favour, get the fuck off my dick. fuck! no! no! better put a leash on that puppy. you know, it's an awful shame about saul gettin' whacked. the cops are gonna be lookin' for the guys who did it. sooner or later they're gonna come around askin' me. you have a sweet night, ladies. fuck you. so this lawyer... kobayashi. came from redfoot. right. why leave this out when you talked to the da? dave, someone to see you. jack! been lookin' for you. still after that coke from the harbour blood bath yesterday? yeah. stop lookin'. there was no coke. i been in la county talkin' to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe in san pedro. he came to this morning. he's in a hungarian mob doing a deal with argentinians. says it was no dope deal. but the $91 million... we know. he says no way on the dope. he tells me they were pulling stumps for turkey the next day. they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it. what's the money for? he didn't know. no one knew. except for a few key people. they were all very hush about it, he says. whatever it was, it was very sensitive. i don' t get it. they tell me you got the cripple from new york. did he mention keyser sze? who? just bear with me here. who's keyser sze? aw, fuck! we've been going over this for an hour and a half. what we need to do is find redfoot, keaton, and get the hell outta here. what we need to do is think. think back. somebody with power. somebody capable of trackin' us from new york to la. dean, what the hell are we doin' here? we're waitin'! i'm out. sit down. no. it's hot and i'm fuckin' bored. mr keaton. mr fenster i recognise from his mug shots, as well as mr mcmanus. i can only assume that you are mr kint, the gentleman who disposed of saul berg. my employer sends his gratitude. a most unexpected benefit. i am mr kobayashi. i have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen. what do you want? my employer requires your services. one job. one day's work. very dangerous. he does not expect all of you to live, but those of you who do will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit. who's your boss? i work for keyser sze. who's keyser sze? judging by the change in mood, mr kint, i feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you. i come with an offer directly from mr sze. an order, actually. what do you mean "an order"? in 1981, mr keaton, you participated in a hijacking of a truck in buffalo, new york. the cargo was raw steel. steel which belonged to mr sze and which was destined for pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor. a most profitable violation of un regulations. you had no way of knowing this because the fellow shipping the steel was working for mr sze without his knowledge. earlier this year mr fenster and mr mcmanus hijacked a flight out of newark. the plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring, also set for pakistan. two months ago mr hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts through queens. gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of new york. they were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to belfast. again mr sze, using pawns who had no knowledge. which brings us to mr kint. nine months ago one of mr sze's less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam by a cripple. he was relieved of $62,000. now, it has taken us some time to find you. our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in new york. you set up the line-up? yes. you were not to be released until i arrived. it seems ms finneran was a little too effective in expediting his release. holding the rest of you was a moot point. what about redfoot? mr redfoot knew nothing. mr sze rarely works with the same people for long, and they never know who they're working for. one cannot be betrayed, if one has no people. so, why are you telling us? because you have stolen from mr sze, mr fenster. all of you. that you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive. he feels you owe him. you will repay your debt. all right, fuck the debt and fuck you. how do we know you work for sze? i don't think that is relevant, mr hockney. all five of you are responsible for the murder of saul berg and his bodyguards. mr redfoot can testify to your involvement and we can see to it he will. what's your point? the offer is this, gentlemen. mr sze's primary interest is narcotics. he's been competing, shall we say, with a group of argentinians for years now. competing with mr sze has taken its toll. the argentinians are negotiating the sale of $91m in cocaine in three days' time. this purchase will revitalise the diminishing strength of their organisation. mr sze would like you to stop the deal. if you choose, you may wait until after the buy. whatever money changes hands is yours. mr sze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board. and then you will be free of your obligations to mr sze. you give me one good reason why i shouldn't kill you right now. a gift from mr sze. good day, gentlemen. my whole life's in here - everything i've done since i was 18. they fuckin' know everything. everybody i've ever worked with or did time with. no. this isn't right. i don't know. who was that guy who used to talk about sze in new york? bricks marlin. yeah, i did jobs for him. indirect stuff. he said he always made five times more money than the job was worth. this guy's a pipe dream. kobayashi's usin' him for window-dressing. i don't know. this is bad. no, it's bullshit. this guy could be lapd. it's a fuckin' set-up. the way i hear it, sze is some kind of butcher. a peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher. there is no keyser sze! who is keyser sze? he's supposed to be turkish. some say his father was german. nobody ever believed he was real. nobody ever knew him or saw anybody that worked directly for him, but to hear kobayashi tell it, anybody could've worked for him. you never knew. that was his power. the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. one story the guys told me - the story i believe - was from his days in turkey. a gang of hungarians wanted their own mob. they realised that to be in power you didn't need guns or money or numbers. you just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't. after a while they come into power, and they come after sze. he was small-time then, just running dope, they say. they come to his home in the afternoon looking for his business. they find his wife and kids in the house and decide to wait for sze. he comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming. the hungarians knew sze was tough, so they let him know they meant business. they tell him they want his territory, all his business. sze looks over the faces of his family, then he showed these men of will what will really was. he tells him he would rather see his family dead than live another day after this. he lets the last hungarian go, waits until his family are buried, then goes after the rest of the mob. he kills their kids, their wives, their parents and their parents' friends. he burns down the houses they live in and the stores they work in. he kills people that owe them money. and like that... he's gone. underground. nobody's ever seen him since. he becomes a myth, a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night. "rat on your pop, and keyser sze will get you." but no one ever really believes. do you believe in him, verbal? keaton always said "i don't believe in god, but i'm afraid of him." well, i believe in god. and the only thing that scares me is keyser sze. do you give any weight to this? i can introduce you to dan metzheiser from justice. he has a file on sze in dc. been a hobby of his. guys equate him to that reporter on the incredible hulk. you've heard of him? on the street? yeah. a few times. outside stuff. somebody working for a guy who worked for a guy who got some money from keyser sze, shit like that. it could be an old badge, a hex sign, to keep people from fucking with you. but you're here. shit, yeah. i got a guy trying to leave hospital on a fried drumstick cos he's afraid of sze. yeah, i'll run it up the flagpole. i told it like it happened on the boat. so what if i left out how i got there? it's so full of holes, the da would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. that's why you never told the da? you tell me, agent kujan. if i said the loch ness monster hired me, what would you say? turn state's evidence, we'll hear it out. i got immunity. what can you offer me? if there really is a keyser sze, he's gonna come looking for you. where's your head? where do you think the pressure's coming from? keyser sze, or whatever you wanna call him, knows where i am. he's got the front burner under your ass to let me go, so he can scoop me up later. immunity was to deal with you. i got a new problem when i post bail. so why play into his hands? we can protect you. oh, gee, thanks, dave. bang-up job so far - extortion, coercion. kiss my pucker. the fuckers that rounded us up and sank us are now bailing me out? fuck you. you think you can catch keyser sze? you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught and sticks his head out? if he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me. after that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again. what happened next? the next morning fenster was gone. he couldn't handle slumming for sze. he left us a note wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money. then what? mcmanus was furious. he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out, all sorts of shit. that night we got the call. what call? kobayashi told us where we could find fenster. we gotta bury him. with what? with our hands. oh, this is nuts. it's dry fucking sand, mcmanus. when he rots, the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away. dig, you fuck! what we gonna do? he's gonna kill us. i don't know about you, peg leg, but i can run. i got no problem with that. kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either. if you run, we're gonna be diggin' a hole for you. you got that? this ain't my boy we're buryin'. i don't owe anybody! so fuck you. he was my partner for five years. we did more jobs and i saw more money than you can ever count, so fuck you! cos now it's payback! it's not payback! it's precaution. you want payback, you wanna run, i don't care. i'm not doin' this for fenster. i'm not doin' it for you. i'm doin' this for me. i'm gonna finish this thing. this kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me. after they killed fenster nobody'd run? i wanted to. i thought we could make it. why didn't you say anything? i tried, but keaton wouldn't have it. it was too far-fetched for him. keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop. to a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. it's always simple. there's no mystery, no arch criminal behind it all. if you got a dead body and think his brother did it, you're right. nobody argued with keaton. they just set their minds to whacking kobayashi. they're coming up. did you hear me? he's coming up. he's on his way down. don't move. press 20. do it now. move! the answer is no. mr sze will be most upset... listen, cocksucker, there is no keyser sze. you mention him again, i'll kill you. a strange threat. i can only assume you've come here to kill me anyway. we know that you can get to us. but now you know that we can get to you. i'm giving you one last chance to call this off. mr s... my employer has made up his mind. he does not change it. neither do we. you got fenster, but you won't get all of us before one of us gets through to you. i believe you, mr mcmanus. i most sincerely do. you would not have been chosen were you not suitable, but it's not my decision. whatever you threaten me with is ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me if i do not carry out my orders in full. i'm the guy that's gonna get you. i just wanted you to know that. i'm so sorry, mr mcmanus. i implore you, mr keaton, believe me, mr sze is very real and very determined. we'll see. before you do me in, mr mcmanus, you will let me finish my business with ms finneran first, won't you? what did you say? edie finneran. she's upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. i requested she be put on the case personally. she flew in yesterday. no matter. kill away, mr mcmanus. you're lyin'. am i? ms finneran's escort while she's here in la. never leaves her side for a moment. i thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands. now rest. the boat will be ready for you on friday. if i see you or any of your friends before then, ms finneran will find herself the victim of a gruesome violation before she dies. as, indeed, will your father, mr hockney, and your uncle randall in arizona, mr kint. i might only castrate mr mcmanus's nephew david. do i make myself clear? we'll take care of the bodies downstairs. we'll add them to the cost of mr fenster. if you'll excuse me, gentlemen. it's a logistical nightmare. close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men. no tellin' how many more are below. can we stealth these guys? nah. with all that coke, they're gonna be ready. which brings me to sunny point number two. even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'. what if we wait for the money? ten more men at least. in my opinion it can't be done. anybody who goes in there is not comin' out alive. i'm gonna wait for the money. did you hear what he just said? if i'm goin' in, i want a cut. me, too. there's nothing that can't be done. i just can't believe we're gonna walk into certain death. the news said it's raining in new york. i don't know. russian, i think. hungarian? sh. package has arrived. you kids ready? i would be, if i didn't have to stop and answer you. i'm ready. mcmanus, you better be set up in ten seconds. i'm ready. i want you to stay here. i'm supposed to cover the... listen, if we fail, take the money and go. keaton, i can't... find edie, tell her what happened. she knows people, she knows what to do. if i don't get kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way. what if i... just do what i say. please. tell her that... tell her i tried. i'm there. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. hi. how ya doin'? is there... is there a problem? fernando... qu hace aqu? nada. aqu no puede pasar. no se puede pasar por aqu? mejor que se regrese. now. # ee-eye, ee-eye, oh # and on that farm he shot some guys # bada-boom, bada-bing, bang, boom elvis has left the building. no dispare. vmonos! oh, man! hello. why didn't you run? i froze up. i thought about fenster and how he looked when we buried him. then i thought about keaton. it looked like he might pull it off. dave. a boy came across a body on the beach this morning. shot twice in the head. two men from the bureau identified him. what else? his name was arturro marquez, a smuggler from argentina. he was arrested last year in new york for trafficking. he escapes to california. they pick him up in long beach. they're setting up extradition, he escapes again. now, get this. edie finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings. kobayashi. new york faxed a copy of his testimony. he was a rat. yeah, a big fucking rat! arturro was very opposed to returning to prison, so much so that he named close to 50 people. guess who he named in the finale? keyser sze. i'll tell you what i know. stop me when this sounds familiar. there was no dope on that boat. argh! you, stay quiet. he's here. i know he's here. that's him. i'm telling you, that's him. i know he's here! you can't understand. that's him. shut up! that's him. you hear me? i'm telling you it's keyser sze! where's hockney? i don't know. there's no coke! what? you heard me, you dumb fuck! no coke! what the fuck do you mean?! i've been in every fucking room! there's gotta be coke! there is nothing! nothing! don't fuck with me. there is no... fucking... coke! i'm outta here. i told them nothing. i swear. i told them nothing. please. mcmanus, what the fuck is goin' on? the strangest thing. your statement says you saw a man in a suit with a slim build. wait a minute. are you saying you saw keyser sze? you said you didn't know who it was. there was dope on that boat. stop stallin'. i'm not! you know what i'm gettin' at! hey! i got immunity. i won't take this! you know... you know what i'm gettin' at, verbal! i don't know! yes, you do! the truth! try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton. i did. you're lying to me! i am not! you've known this whole fuckin' time! i don't know what you're saying. i did see keaton get shot, i swear. then why didn't you help him? you had a gun. he was your friend! because i was afraid. ok? afraid. afraid of what? i knew it was keyser sze. but keaton... it was keyser sze, agent kujan. i mean, the devil himself. how do you shoot the devil in the back? what if you miss? all right. let's get back to the pier. arturro marquez. ever hear of him? what? no. he was a stool pigeon for the justice department. he swore out a statement saying that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser sze. it says in the report: "he had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including but not exclusive to drug-trafficking and murder." i never heard of him. his people were selling him to a gang of hungarians. most likely the same hungarians sze all but wiped out back in turkey. the money wasn't there for dope. the hungarians were gonna buy the one guy that could incriminate keyser sze. i said i never heard of him. keaton did. edie finneran was marquez's extradition adviser. she knew what he knew. i don't under... there were no drugs. it was a hit. a suicide mission to whack out the one guy that could finger keyser sze. so sze put some thieves to it, men he knew he could march into certain death. you're saying sze sent us to kill someone? keaton did. verbal, he left you behind for a reason. just do what i tell you. if you all knew sze'd find you anywhere, why did he give you the money to run? he could have used you on the boat. he wanted me to live. a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple. no, sir. why? edie. i don't buy the reform story for a minute. even if i did, i certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. so why? because he was my friend. no, verbal. he wasn't your friend. keaton didn't have friends. what are you doin' here? he saved you because he wanted it that way. it was his will. keaton was keyser sze. no. the kind of man who could wrangle men like hockney and mcmanus. the kind of man who could engineer a line-up through all his contacts at nypd. the kind of man who could've killed edie finneran! she was found yesterday at a hotel in pennsylvania, shot twice in the head. what do you think about keaton now, verbal? edie? he used all of you to get him on that boat. he couldn't get on alone. he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. the one man that could identify him. this is all bullshit. you said you saw him die. or did you? you had to hide when you heard the police cars. you said you heard the shot before the fire. but you didn't see him die. i knew him. he would never... he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. he knew we were close, you said it yourself. where was the political pressure coming from? it was keaton. immunity was your reward. but why me? why not fenster, mcmanus or hockney? i'm stupid. i'm a cripple. why me? because you're a cripple, verbal. because you're stupid. because you're weaker than them. if he's dead, if what you say is true, then it won't matter. it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york, wasn't it? tell me the truth. it was all keaton. we followed him from the beginning. i didn't know. i saw him die. i believe he's dead. oh, christ! you're not safe on your own. you think he's... keyser sze? i don't know, verbal. keyser sze's a shield. or, like you said, a spook story. but i know keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you. stay and let us protect you. no way. i'm not bait. i post today. you posted 20 minutes ago. captain leo wants you out of here asap, unless you turn state's. i'll take my chances. if someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there. turn state's evidence. you might never see trial. maybe so. but i'm not a rat, agent kujan. fuckin' cops. excuse me. can i use your fax machine? you'll have to sign for these, mr kint. one watch, gold. one cigarette lighter, gold. one pack of cigarettes. thank you. we've still got nothing, dave. i know what i wanted to know about keaton. which is nothing. no matter. he'll have to know how close we came. if keaton is alive, he's not coming up again. a rumour that doesn't die. nothin'. man, you're a slob. yeah, but it all has a system, dave. it all makes sense when you look at it right. you gotta stand back from it. you wanna see a real horror show, you should see my garage. when i was in that barbershop quartet in skokie. where's your head, agent kujan? in california, his name is redfoot. there was a lawyer. kobayashi. when i was picking beans in guatemala, we'd make fresh coffee. there was a lawyer. what lawyer, verbal? i am mr kobayashi. kobayashi. kobayashi. tell me every last detail. i work for keyser sze. convince me. convince me. every creep that works the street for a living will know the name of verbal kint. the cripple, did you see him?! the cripple! which way did he go? that way. i'm smarter than you and i'm gonna find out what i wanna know. to a cop, the explanation's simple. you know what i'm gettin' at! the truth! ..no arch criminal behind it all. who's keyser sze? you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught and sticks his head out? because you're stupid, verbal. because you're a cripple. who's the gimp? you've known the whole fuckin' time! who's keyser sze? who's keyser sze? was how to spot a murderer. from new york. he mention keyser sze? you'll never hear from him again. the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. and like that... he's gone.
