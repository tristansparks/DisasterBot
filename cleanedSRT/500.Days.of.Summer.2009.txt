this is a story of boy meets girl. the boy, tom hansen of margate, new jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy... until the day he met "the one." this belief stemmed from early exposure to sad british pop music... and a total misreading of the movie the graduate. elaine! elaine! the girl, summer finn of shinnecock' michigan' did not share this belief. since the disintegration of her parents' marriage' she'd only loved two things. the first was her long' dark hair. the second was how easily she could cut it off... and feel nothing. tom meets summer on january 8. he knows almost immediately she's who he's been searching for. this is a story of boy meets girl. but you should know up front' this is not a love story.  they made a statue of us   and put it on a mountaintop   now tourists come and stare at us   blow bubbles with their gum   take photographs of fun   have fun   they'll name a city after us   and later say it's all our fault   then they'll give us a talking to   'cause they've got years of experience   living in a den of thieves   rummaging for answers in the pages   living in a den of thieves   and it's contagious   and it's contagious  we didn't know who else to call. it's amanda heller all over again. you did the right thing. now' where is he? thomas. rachel. what are you doing here? i'm here to help you. help me how? first' put down the plate. drink this. what is that? vodka. um' does mom know that you're here? 'cause it's probably past 10:00. just start from the beginning, and tell us what happened. things were going so well. then what? i think we should stop seeing each other. just like that? just like that. did she say why? i mean' this thing what are we doing? i mean, is this normal? norm i i don't know. i don't care. i'm happy. aren't you happy? you're happy? you're not? all we do is argue. that is bullshit. maybe she was just in a bad mood. yeah, maybe like a hormonal thing. p.m.s.? what do you know about p.m.s.? more than you' tom. then what happened? this can't come as a total surprise to you. i mean, we've been like sid and nancy for months now. summer, sid stabbed nancy... seven times with a kitchen knife. i i mean, we have some disagreements, but i hardly think i'm sid vicious. no. i'm sid. oh, so i'm nancy? let's just eat, and we'll talk about it later. mmm. that is good. i'm really glad we did this. i love these pancakes. what? tom, don't go. you're still my best friend! jesus. you've broken up with girls before. yes. and girls have broken up with you before. this is different. why? 'cause it's summer. so you'll you'll meet somebody new. point is , you're the best guy i know. you'll get over her. i think it's kind of like how they say. there's, uh there's plenty of other fish in the sea. no. they- they say that. well, they're lying. i don't want to get over her. i want to get her back. maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. the nuclear family is dead' and we need a new holiday that recognizes that. may 21st. other mother's day. thank you. i'd say we've got some potential here. what do you think, hans en? could you write up some prototypes for these? uh' mr. vance, there's a telephone call for you on line three. oh. thank you. uh' everyone, this is summer, my new assistant. summer just moved here from michigan. right. michigan. right. uh, summer, everyone. everyone, summer. excuse me. i have to take this. it's nice to meet you all. there's only two kinds of people in the world. there's women, and there's men. summer finn was a woman. height, average. weight, average. shoe size, s lightly above average. for all intents and purposes , summer finn, just another girl. except she was not. to wit, in 1998, summer quoted a song by the scottish band belle and sebastian... in her high school yearbook. "color my life with the chaos of trouble." this spike in michigan sales of their album... the boy with the arab strap... continues to puzzle industry analysts. summer's employment at the daily freeze during her sophomore year... coincided with an inexplicable 212% increase in revenue. every apartment summer rented... was offered at an average rate of 9.2% below market value. and her round-trip commute to work... averaged 18.4 double takes per day. it was a rare quality, this "summer effect." rare, and yet something every post adolescent male has encountered... at least once in their lives. for tom hansen to find it now in a city of 400,000 offices , 91,000 commercial buildings and 3.8 million people- well, that could only be explained by one thing: fate. dude, i hear she's a bitch. really? yeah. patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. she's totally not having it. maybe she was just in a hurry. and maybe she's an uppity, "better than everyone" superskank. damn. i know. she's pretty hot. that sucks . why is it pretty girls... think they can treat people like crap and get away with it? centuries of reinforcement. you know what? screw her. i don't care. if s he wants to be that way, fine.  driving in your car   oh, pleas e don't drop me home  smiths? hi. i love the smiths. sorry? i said i love the smiths. you have- you have good taste in music. you like the smiths? yeah.  to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die  i love 'em. holy shit. there you go. have another piece. ah. drinks? arthur, did you get a piece? thanks. want one? yeah. want one? mmm. summer, right? oh. yeah. smiths fan. yeah. tom. want some, uh, uh it's not champagne. i don't know what it is. sure. so, how's it goin'? pretty good. you just moved here, right? mm-hmm. when? saturday. oh, wow. and, uh, what brought you? boredom mostly. wanted to try something new and exciting. mmm. well, clearly you've come to the right place. so, have you worked here long? about three or four years. wow. you've... always wanted to write greeting cards? no, i don't even want to do it now. well, you should do something else then. yeah. i studied to be an architect, actually. you did? that's cool. what happened there? it didn't work out. i needed a job, and here we are. you any good? well, um, i wrote this one.

'97. '97. see ending theme plays ] shoot. i don't think the two of you are exactly authorities on modern relationships. so, what should i do? you should ask her. what? well, why rock the boat, is what i'm thinking. i mean, things are going well. you start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. it's like saying, "i love you." yeah, i know what you mean. that's what happened between me and sean. who the hell's sean? my boyfriend before mark. who the- never mind. so, what you're saying i'm saying you do want to ask her. it's obvious. you're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want, which will shatter all the illusions of how great these past few months have been. now look, if it were me, i'd find out now before you show up at her place... and, well, she's in bed with lars from norway. who's lars from norway? just some guy she met at the gym... with brad pitt's face and jesus' abs. wait! no, coach. we're not done here. rachel! look, it's easy, tom. just don't be a pussy. you okay? yeah. you sure? summer, i gotta ask you something. what?

thanks. it's a free country. i can't believe this is your boyfriend. what are you doing? it was really just a crazy thing. it happened like it felt like it happened fast, but really, it it also felt like it was happening really slowly, like everything all was just i don't know. it doesn't feel like you think it would hey, what's the matter? i just i can't believe you. you can't believe me? you were so completely, completely uncool in there. wait. are you mad at me? i just got my ass kicked for you. oh, really? was that for me? was that for my benefit?

i'm flexible on the cute, so twenty-one years. she's the light that guides me home. yes, that is from one of our cards. no. someone else wrote it. doesn't make it less true. i think technically the "girl of my dreams"... would probably have, like, a really bodacious rack, you know. maybe different hair. probably- you know, she'd probably be a little more into sports. but, um, truthfully, robyn's robyn's better than the girl of my dreams. she's real.  he never, ever saw it coming at all   never, ever saw it coming at all  tom walked to her apartment, intoxicated by the promise of the evening.  it's all right it's all right  he believed that this time... his expectations would align with reality.  it's all right   hey, open wide here comes original sin  hi. hey.  hey, open wide here comes original sin  you look nice. yeah. thanks. i like your tie. wow! hi. how you doing?

uh, i write greeting cards. tom could be a really great architect if he wanted to be. that's unusual. i mean, what made you go from one to the other? i guess i just figured, why make something disposable, like a building, when you can make something that lasts forever, like a greeting card?  it's all right it's all right   it's all right it's all right  what?  it's all right   no one's got it all  do you guys know each other?  no one's got it all   power to the people we don't want it   we want pleasure and the tvs try to rape us   and i guess that they're succeeding   and we're going to these meetings   but we're not doing any meeting   and we're trying to be faithful   but we're cheating cheating, cheating   i'm the hero of the story don't need to be saved   it's all right   it's all right it's all right, it's all right   it's all right it's all right   it's all right it's all right, it's all right   it's all right it's all right   no one's got it all   all, all   all, all   hung up and bent on a stranger  just trying to swing a full-time ride   i never knew the cold hand of danger   till i met this one and took it inside   now i can't get near it  get a room! really.  don't want to hear it   my cover's blown   i walked in the rain like a drone   all the way to marquette   the infinite pet   oh, no   no, no, no, no, no   cheaper than all your threats   no, no  shit. i've been calling you every five minutes. are you okay?

we haven't heard from sympathy in a while. hansen? yeah? the winter collection? do you have anything to contribute? uh, no. i really don't. okay. we'll come back to you. uh, mckenzie? actually, you know what? yes, tom? can i say something about the cat? well, okay. yeah, uh, this is and, rhoda, no disrespect here, but, um, this is total shit. tom! "go for it" and "you can do it"? that's not inspirational. that's suicidal. if pickles goes for it right there, that's a dead cat. these are lies. we're liars. think about it. why do people buy these things? it's not 'cause they want to say how they feel. people buy cards 'cause they can't say how they feel, or they're afraid to. we provide the service that lets them off the hook. you know what? i say, to hell with it! let's level with america. at least let them speak for themselves! right? i mean, look! what what is this? what does it say? "congratulations on your new baby." right? how 'bout, "congratulations on your new baby. that's it for hanging out. nice knowing you." sit down, hansen. how 'bout this one, with all the pretty hearts on the front? i know where this is going. yep! "happy valentine's day, sweetheart. i love you." that sweet? ain't love grand? this is exactly what i'm talking about. what does that even mean, "love"? do you know? do you? anybody? tom. if somebody gave me this card, mr. vance, i would eat it. it's- it's these cards, and the movies, and the pop songs they're to blame for all the lies... and the heartache, everything. and we're responsible. i'm responsible. i think we do a bad thing here. people should be able to say how they feel how they really feel not, you know, some words that some strangers put in their mouths. words like "love"... that don't mean anything. sorry. i'm sorry. i, uh i quit. i'm there's enough bullshit in the world without my help. all right. next we do running drills. hey, you're sketching again. yeah, well,just doodling. okay, tom. we got 20 seconds. talk to me. you okay? yeah, i'm good. i'm great. you know, my friends are all in love with you. you know, it's like we said. plenty of other fish in the sea. thanks. but, uh, those are guppies. yeah. hey, tom? mmm. look, i know you think that she was the one, but i don't. now, i think you're just remembering the good stuff. next time you look back, i, uh i really think you should look again. it's playing at 5:00. do you wanna see it? um, i don't know. we could just go back to your place or- no, i really want to see it. let's go.  time it was and what a time it was   it was   a time of innocence   a time of confidences  you okay? yeah. what what is it? the movie? it's nothing. i'm just i'm just being stupid. yeah? yeah.  preserve your memories they're all that's left you  it pains me we live in a world... where nobody's heard of spearmint. i've never heard of them. i put 'em on that mix i made you. they're track one. oh, yeah. so, what do you wanna do? i think i'm just gonna call it a day. you don't wanna get some dinner? are you hungry? you all right? i'm just tired. okay. i got it. pancakes!  oh, girl, i don't know all the reasons why   i found the answer looking in your eye   i go out walking all day long   take away this lonely man soon he will be gone   'cause i'll tell you everything   about living free   yes, i can see you, girl   can you see me   you don't need to know what i do all day   it's as much as i know watch it waste away   'cause i'll tell you everything   about living free   yes, i can see you, girl   can you see me   'cause i'll tell you everything   about being free  hey, tom. i thought i might see you here. i always loved this place, ever since you brought me. so i, uh i guess i should say congratulations. only if you mean it. ah. well, in that case so, are you okay? i will be, eventually. you wanna hmm. i like your suit. ah, thanks. you look sharp. so do you. thanks. i quit the office. you did? i didn't know. that's great! and you, um you're married. yeah. it's crazy, huh? you should have told me when we were at the i know. you know, at the wedding when we were dancing. well, he hadn't asked me yet. but he was in your life. yeah. so why'd you dance with me?
