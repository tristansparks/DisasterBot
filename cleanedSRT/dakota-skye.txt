'night! hey, dakota? what? never mind. come on! i hate that! i really hate that! i hate it when guys do that! they want you to know they want to say something, but they're too afraid to actually say it, and then try to bait you to ask them! i'm sorry. do you wanna say something, jonah? yes. what is it, then? well, what is it? i can't tell you. why not? because i can't. ugh, fine! i want to tell you that i like you. but i can't tell you that, can i? i want to tell you to forget about him. he's a great guy, the best, and he's my brother in everything but blood, and you two are good together, but i still want to tell you to tell him to fuck off and to be with me. i want to tell you that since the moment i met you i can't even get your face out of my brain. but i can't tell you that, that all i want right now in the world is to take you away with me. no him, no here, no this. just us. if just for a day. you know? but i can't tell you that. i mean, you can't make me. i mean, what kind of a person would i be if i went and told you something like that? no. no, i didn't. good night. good night, dakota. so, you ditched us again last night. yeah, i guess i did. denise almost had a fit. denise is to annoying as dakota is to doesn't give a fuck. we were worried. what, mom, am i grounded? jesus christ, you can be a mean little bitch. what? i mean, honestly, we're just trying to help, and-- yeah, i know that. i'm sorry. what makes you think that you're so much better than the rest of us? beth: hello? look, i don't know, all right? you're just-- you're way ahead of me, that's all. why not? there's nothing you can do about it. it is what it is. i don't know why i even bother with you anymore. because in the 3rd grade we made each other friendship bracelets. say you were gonna jump off of a building, all right? i'm sorry, why would i do that? just imagine that you're gonna jump off of a building, okay? no. why would i do that? i don't know. whatever. the band breaks up. we've broken up, like, a thousand times. okay, maybe i break up with you. well, that's not gonna happen. say it was your dick in a motorcycle accident. yeah. okay, i'm with you. shoot. all right. so, you're gonna jump. would you rather land face-down or face-up? what does it matter? dead is dead. god, does it have to be my dick? but it does matter. face-down, you're facing the end, you'll know the exact moment that you're gonna hit the ground. face-up, though, you can just kick back and enjoy the ride, enjoy it while it lasts, and let the end sneak up on you. face-up. face-up? wow, you're really, like, fucking up my high. it's, like, whoa! i'm sorry. that's okay. want some? no! sorry. no! no! hello? hey. hi. come over. no. no?! what do you mean "no"? i mean no. first you're-- listen, there are rules. oh, wow. okay, whatever. that's fine. no. no, no, no! i'll be there in 10 minutes. oh! drive. i said "drive.
