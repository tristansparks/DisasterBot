'cause walt specifically promised me an agreeable lab partner. walt? you need to relax. actually i need to learn this. because why? because you have to get a four on your ap exam if you wanna get a college credit, in case you didn't you know. then you'll be ahead of the game, right? then i can focus on the things i'm good at and keep up my gpa. okay, so we need to fill this one with sodium-tiosulphate and this one with nitrate solution... gotta keep up that gpa. it's kinda help if you ever wanna get a job. a job? can we just do the lab? i'd love to! let's do the lab! except you're about ten years into the future. we don't need chemistry, we... ...we need time travel mr. miles, this is ap. keith is actually pretty sharp when he applies himself. okay... but we kind of... lack chemistry? yeah. try to make it work, okay? about this natalie anderson thing... yes? walter, she's a complete anal compulsive control freak! how do you expect me to work with that? but keith, you were who... i'm kidding. kidding. we're in pretty good shape. who the hell do you think you are? who do you think i am? hey, miss key club! hey! so how are you adjusting? oh, well, you tell me how am i doing? well, you only got a 98 percent on the history midterms... ...so you're pretty much falling apart i hate people like you. hey, so listen, are you gonna be at the brick again, friday? are you going? it could happen. alright, keith. thanks, man! who's that guy? oh... ...he's just my lab parner. nobody. so you don't remember? what? well, i sat behind you on the sixth great play you were the princess and i was russian soldier number three. i don't remember that. of course not. princess never remembers the little people. excuse me, well i'll cry for you. you should! you should cry for me from your early-decision tower. it's posted in the front office. why do they do that? why duke? great faculty, division one, that kind of stuff i'm sure, you get what you pay for. actually i have a partial scholarship. ah, that's right. there goes the positive... tennis. so they basically give you a bunch of money for hitting a ball over a net. something like that. where did you apply? nowhere. not going to college? not in judeo christian sense. no, i'm not. so, what are you doing after graduation? the sky's the limit. that's informative. why are you taking an ap class if you...? i haven't picked. then "advance placement" or what? i'm sure there's a very simple explanation. of course there is natalie and you're not gonna stop until you figure. it out. that's on like a challenge. you're on. so this's all based on one little conversation. you don't even know if he'll be there tonight. oh, he'll definitely be there. oh, your power of positive thinking? hey, brooke. howdy? hey, nat, can i borrow ten bucks? for what? come on, i'll pay you back tomorrow. get out! let's go! it's really cool. what happened? who turned off the music? can i help you? ahh, yeah. who's that guy? what is he doing? buddy, relax, you'll like it! i promise! listen! what, you think you can change that, huh? because you'll like it. see? i'm just kidding buddy, just have a good time! alright? senorita, let's go! what? oh, oh, no... turn away! hey welcome back! interesting choice of music. yeah? can you keep up?

why not do something amazing? hey there's the whole world out there. everybody here just wanna go to state. no one wants to do anything, you know try anything new. yeah. keith. keith! the lab report is due tomorrow! ah, yes! but the real pressing question is how is rafael marquez? your boyfriend. he's not! great choice that rafael! brainy stud! perfect guy! can't go wrong! you were at the brick! no. but you were. if you weren't then how would you know? because that's where everyone goes. what about the lab report? hop in! come on, come on! i do my best work while i'm driving. i have your book. by heating tin metal... ...in air ...at a high temperature we are able to produce a tin-oxygen product called... wait! so we need to convert the masses to moles then divide the greater mole quantity by the lesser. okay, so... 0.0173 tin, and 0.0350 oxygen. so the mole ratio is? mole ratio? what's that? it's the thing you have to figure out. but you are already know the answer. oh, come on, you're being a jerk! i gotta be back in fifteen. what's the rush?  we're here in a yellow truck, a road ahead of us and nothing but opportunities. okay, what opportunities...? choose a place! pick a place! right now! at random! okay, i choose... ...the third point on our lab report calculating the mole ratio. i can't concentrate driving in a straight line like this, this is not gonna work. then turn! where? anywhere. whoa! very funny. the mole ratio therefore is 2:1. but now we need to find the potential oxidation numbers of tin and oxygen. which are? it's time for our picnic scene. keith! there he is! how's it going? move along, dear! in case you haven't heard, picnics they usually take place outdoors. oh, is that what it says in the official picnic rule book? this isn't funny. do you think our check is ready? i..i know pumpkin love, you know i'm pissed off too. can you believe this shit? it's been three months since that accident. the nerve... take me back to school! now! yeah! let's get back to the library and finish our lab report in a safe, acceptable way like everybody else. bone grafts are really starting to kick in now. hey, ralph! no, thanks. you said 2:1 right for the mole ratio? yeah. duke. they'll give you a job in a place like this one day? god, no. my dad used to work in a place like this. ah, yes. daddy anderson. an accountant? a salesman? a norwegian fisherman! district manager for a phone company. you're not very good at reading minds. well that's 'cause i wasn't really trying. he manages stacks of paper. moving them from side to side every day, he hates his job. when he was your age he dreamed of going to duke but they rejected him. so he poured over every detail of your application, night after night until you finally got it right. natalie anderson, the star of the household, who loves being in the center of the attention. she just wished it didn't mean having to play tennis all of the time. how am i doing? okay... it's actually not so bad. can i help you? oh, we're just...waiting for mr. richardson. he said he had to finish a phone call. okay. goddamn that richardson! yeah... who's he think he is, that little monkey? i'm sick of this shit! you know what , baby? we're going straight to the top! we're getting this littlemonkey ass fired! ...lame excuses, bullshit! never pay out. we just have to be patient, honey! okay, so you're an only child. your mom works for a diaryfresh. your dad is a... ...a, the sir in construction and you live in a ranch house. how am i doing? actually i have two brothers, three sisters, dad works in real estate, mom helps him out and we live in a farmhouse. a big old farmhouse. where? where do you live? beaver creek, off the route 10. that old white house? with the big front porch? with the big front porch. oh, that's such a great place. that's where i live. okay, this is nice, but that's not enough to fill up two pages. okay, but this is all the pictures that we have. oh, really? okay, well then why don't you just draw something, and throw it on page 2.. ...because this is not gonna fit with what's... okay, i'll take some more, okay? okay, thank you. so, were you with the freak? he's not a freak. did raff come? well, you said that you'll back to be there. it wasn't actually a definite plan. i told to him you had to bait. did he say anything? oh, just that his parents are going out tonight and he wanted to have a pool-party. cool. and he sounded really pissed that you blew him off. natalie, what are you doing with what's his face? a lab report. oh, really? and you just decided it'll be fine if you left me here to deal with all this shit? i lost track of time. because the lab report was so exciting? i had to get it down. what's your problem? i'm just having a really shitty day. what? skinny envelope. notre dame? oh, shit! wait-listed. really? oh, they accept like three percent from the waitlists. it's basically rejection. no, no, we can add stuff to the application. yeah, and what good is that gonna do?
