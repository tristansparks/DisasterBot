years ago, with you, mom and henry. do you remember visiting casa de la caritat? the almshouse. mm-hm. that's right. you mentioned meier. his barcelona museum stands in the same area as casa de la caritat. it drinks the same light. meier designed a series of louvered skylights to capture that light and cast it inward to illuminate the art within, but indirectly. and that was important, because although light enhances art, it can also degrade it. but you know all that already, you son of a... now, this... where do you suppose this is to be built? i have no idea. oh, but you said you liked it. conceptually. now, come on. you know as well as i do that the light in barcelona is quite different from the light in tokyo. and the light in tokyo is different from that in prague. a truly great structure, one that is meant to stand the tests of time, never disregards its environment. a serious architect takes that into account. he knows that if he wants presence, he must consult with nature. he must be captivated by the light. always the light. always. hey. i have an emergency. take my shift. please. hello. klyczynski: yes. kate: aw. playing) pick a place. i'll be there, i promise. tomorrow, what do you say?
