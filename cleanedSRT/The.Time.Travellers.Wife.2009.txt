'i have nothing left that i could give,' answered the girl. 'then promise me, if you should become queen, your first child.' 'who knows whether that will ever happen?' thought the miller's daughter." no! mommy! henry. henry. there's nothing you can do. no. shh. let me go! mommy! there's nothing you can do. listen. listen to me. i don't have much time. you were in the car. it was spinning. and all of a sudden... ...you were home and it was two weeks ago... ...and you were watching yourself. watching your mom and dad read to you. you time-traveled, okay?

henry, we've been planning this dinner for a long time. we have? go to the beau thai. it's your favorite. it is. mm-hm. you look like you've been having a hard time. you know, everything's gonna be okay. so, um, is it "yes," then, to dinner?

well, you told me that dr. kendrick said that you should stop drinking... ...because it makes you travel. who's dr. kendrick? he's your doctor. he wins the berger for his work in genetics. he.... he helps you. this is too much. i'm sorry. you told me to go easy on you, and, um, i'm not. ahh.... i wrote down every time that you came to visit me. which i gather i did, or will do, fairly often. the last time that i saw you, i was 18. seems that you go back to the same places a lot. yeah, it's like gravity. big events pull you in. i was a big event. so it would seem. clare, right? yeah. could we pretend just for a minute that this is the first time we've met? okay. sure. it's just that.... it's just that you're my best friend. i've been in love with you all my life. clare: is this really necessary? henry: yeah. count to 1000. clare: ahh.... okay. one. two. three. four hundred. six hundred. eight hundred. a thousand. do you want a drink? i don't want a drink. god, you're so young. henry: tell me again. how did we meet? you're older than you are now. maybe i'm not supposed to tell you. well, i think i need to know. who's there? henry: greetings, earthling. mark, you idiot. henry: ow! clare, i'm not gonna hurt you. just please don't throw anything at me. who are you, how do you know my name, and why can't you come out? henry: can you just hand me the blanket? maybe i should call my mom. henry: no, no, no. don't call your mom, please. just hand me the blanket and i'll leave. what do you need the blanket for? henry: i'm a time traveler. i come from the future. and when i do, i don't get to bring my clothes. there's no such thing as time travelers. yes, there is. in fact, you and i are friends in the future. when you're a lady. am i pretty? yes. very. prove you're from the future. well, your name is clare abshire. born may 24th, 1972. your parents are philip and lucille-- so you know things. that doesn't prove you're from the future. okay. this weekend, your brother, mark, who's a real pain in the ass... ...falls out of a tree and breaks his arm. yeah, but i won't know till then if you're telling the truth or not. well, if you hang around long enough, you'll see me disappear. but you just got here. i'll be back again. lots of times. in fact... ...i'll be back next tuesday at 4. and it'd be great if, when you come then, you could bring me some clothes. something your dad won't miss. nice to meet you. don't worry about that. it's been over for a while. this is weird. i never knew you at this age. i mean, i've only known you as this... ...mature, worldly person. i'm competing against myself. no. you were just kind of my perfect guy. clare: i just can't get used to this. i mean, i just keep waiting for you to disappear. henry: oh, it'll happen, believe me. how's it feel? i mean, i know what it's like to watch you go... ...but what's it like to always be the one that's going? sometimes it feels like you've stood up too quickly. your hands and feet are tingling, and then they're not there at all. sometimes it feels like your attention has wandered just for an instant... ...then you're standing naked someplace. maybe you've been there before, maybe you haven't. you don't know how long it's gonna last, so you start walking... ...till you find some clothes. then you seem just like everybody else. except you're stranded and all alone, just waiting to disappear. clare: but you get to see people from the past. people who are gone, like your mom. yeah, but the thing is, you can't change what happens to them. i've tried. it just happens anyway. henry: it's nice. hey. and this is charisse, my roommate. hi. clare: my best friend. and our excellent cook for tonight. welcome. because i don't cook. well, you should know that going in. she's a lovely girl, but she can't cook toast. gomez? yeah, short for gomolinski. it's really nice to meet you. we didn't wanna meet you, but seems to be the only way to catch a glimpse of clare. charisse: please ignore gomez. do you want some wine? no, thanks. do you want some water? yeah, sure. yeah? you didn't tell me how cute he was. he's not that cute. doesn't talk much either. i couldn't get anything out of him except he's a librarian. well, maybe if you would stop interrogating him.... you never had a boyfriend. you spend every minute with the guy. wondering what the draw is. leave her alone. she's codependent. you thought she was gonna dodge that bullet? i don't know. i just think he's not that cute. all right, so can we put the potatoes in yet? or do you wanna wait until the vegetables are done? charisse: where's the pan? gomez: how do i know? charisse: you can help. gomez: i don't even live here. charisse: you-- gomez: first, i'm a man. second of all, i'm a guest here. are you reading my diary? told you that was private. i didn't read it. well, it kind of looked like you did. i was trying to find the dates. the dates that i go to see you. so i could tell the little girl in the meadow. if i'm that important to her... ...i wanted to tell her when i was coming to see her so she wouldn't have to wait. christ, i'm sorry. i don't know what i was thinking. i should go. i'd like you to stay. woman: you were there all night. man 1: come on, kick his ass. man 2: guys, check this out. man 3: come on, he's a fag. kick his ass. man 4: oh, no. come on. hey, hey, hey. break it up, break it up. henry. gomez. what are you doing? goddamn homophobe. dude, what in the hell are you wearing? what's the date? what do you mean, "what's the date?" what year? what do you mean, "what year?" forget it. i gotta get some clothes. yeah, the pink's not working for you. hey. gomez: what are you doing now? picking a lock. gomez: huh? close the door. you wanna tell me what the hell's going on here? what are you on? seriously. hey, you know, if you have a problem, maybe i can help. yeah, right. i don't give a shit about you, but clare i care about. why don't you tell me what this is about? you wanna know? i'm gonna tell you. because you and i are gonna be friends for a long time. you might as well know now. know what? i look older, right? that's because i am. i've come back to this night from the future. i'm a time traveler. oh, my god, you are out of your mind. started when i was 6 years old. i have fits. i disappear. i travel through time. i've come to this night from 2003. what year is this? 1995. i don't like this. i get dislocated in time. i never know when it's gonna happen or where i'm gonna end up. i have to break and enter, steal clothes from the first person i see. you name it, i've done it. uh-huh. there's something wrong with you. yeah, there is. but i care about clare more than you can imagine, so don't worry about that. gomez: whoa, hey, i'm reassured. listen, in the future, do charisse and i get married? do i go bald? does charisse go bald? i'm not gonna tell you things about your life. knowing stuff in advance makes you crazy. you're full of shit, you know that? you won't think that in a minute. yeah? why's that? hey. hey. charisse is out. henry here? no, he's at the library. don't marry him, clare. what? just don't marry henry, okay? you know, he hasn't asked me yet. yeah, you know what i'm talking about. i love him. here. come here. i saw him last night at the vic. barrel of laughs. first, he beats up a guy, then we burglarize the army-navy store. and then he tells me that he's a time traveler. you know, because he travels through time. and did you believe him? um.... not until he disappeared right in front of me, you know? like, he just disappeared. yeah, it's a problem. are you saying you know about this? i've known for a very long time. okay, i don't know what the hell's going on, all right? i don't need to know how the whole thing works, because i don't care. but, uh, just presuming for a second that we're not all out of our fricking minds... ...whatever henry has, it's, uh.... it's not good. i've been waiting for him my entire life, and now he's here. i mean, it's already happened. i couldn't even change it if i wanted to. well, you're worse off than i thought. maybe i am. man: that guy stole my wallet. my wallet! that guy stole my wallet. hold the train. excuse me. are you annette detamble? yes. i love you. i mean, your work. your singing. you have a great voice. thank you. i appreciate that. people don't usually recognize me. not on the subway, anyway. ha, ha. my name's henry. how funny. i have a son named henry. but he's just 3. i met a girl. and since i've been with her, i feel safe. i haven't felt that way for a long time. not since i was a kid. i wish she could hear you sing. maybe she will one day. i'm really glad i met you. i'm glad i met you too. make sure that girl knows how you feel about her. your son loves you very much. i know. henry: hello? dad? what are you doing here? i was worried. i called you several times. i've been ill. yeah. i called the orchestra. hmm. they told me you've been on sick leave since september. august. makes it hard to play the violin. henry: that's not gonna help. sure it does. want one? no. i don't drink anymore. pity. it was our one shared enthusiasm. first thing we gotta do is get someone in here to clean the place up. make you some meals. i mean, do you even eat? i mean, do you want me to come around more often? take you to the doctor? help pay some bills? what? no. no? "no" to what, everything? or just some of that? get your own life in order before you start telling me how to live mine. i'm getting married. who would marry you? does she know about--? she knows everything about me. everything. her name's clare. clare abshire. she's an artist. i'd really like to give her mom's wedding and engagement rings. that's why i'm here. and i think mom would really like that. how would you know what your mother would like? you barely knew her. i knew her. i still know her now. i've just seen her on the subway. i see her pushing me in the stroller. you know, i see her with you too. this thing i have isn't always a curse. then why don't you keep her from getting into that goddamn car? i would if i could. you know that. i've watched her die hundreds of times. i can never get there in time to change it. i still miss her. i miss her every day. so do i. henry. i never wanted to have anything in my life that i couldn't stand losing. but it's too late for that. it's not because you're beautiful and smart and perfect. i don't feel alone anymore. will you marry me? no. i didn't mean that. i just wanted to try it. i just wanted to say it... ...to assert my own sense of free will. i.... but my free will wants you. so it's a yes? yes. of course. a thousand times yes. mark: you ever handled a gun before? henry: not exactly. i-- hello? mom, we're home. mark: you are in for a treat, my friend. oh, my god. that dress looks like it's been through the wars. i told you to have it shipped. mom, it'll be fine. henry, i don't mean to be a nag, but any word on your father? we'll need to adjust the seating plan. i'm not sure he'll make it. shame. he could've joined in on the killing spree. it's how men bond, apparently. philip. philip: pull. lucille: philip, they're here. are you ready for this? it's a real circus. yes, i am, sir. hope you know what you've signed on for. with clare, i mean. i'm not sure i understand. her mother and i didn't succeed in preparing her for the real world, i'm afraid. i don't know about that. she seems to manage pretty well for herself. well, that's good to hear. do you ever do any hunting? no. never. well, maybe i could take you out sometime. i'd like that. yeah. usually i'm the one who's getting chased. you know what they say. life's a hunt. barber: good morning. henry: morning. barber: have a seat. what can we do for you today? cut it off. all of it? yeah, i'm getting married tomorrow. and my wife, she likes short hair. congratulations. see what we can do for you. try to make you happy, the both of you. porter: take your bags? richard: i've got it. thank you. porter: very well. dad. you came. well... ...i suppose i'll have to meet her parents. her dad's a republican. and a hunter. oh, dear. henry: give us a second. i gotta take a vallum. vallum? is that a good idea? wouldn't be a wedding without a groom. freak. you okay in there? oh, shit. man: let me get this for you, ladies. woman: thank you. this hair, it's always been difficult. mom. stop already, okay? it's fine. but, my god, you are beautiful. when henry sees you coming down the aisle... ...he's gonna pass out on the spot. could you go check on the boys? okay. oh, god. okay. oh, shit. alicia: are you guys nearly ready? yeah. yeah, we're good. we're fine. great day for a wedding, huh? flowers look really pretty and everything. everyone else is downstairs waiting. what do you want me to tell clare? we'll just probably be, like, another half an hour or so to get pretty, and then.... and then, you know, put some pants on, and then we'll be ready to go. five minutes. i'll let clare know. gomez: what year are you from? you look like my grandpa. don't worry. it all works out. oh, great. i just hope no one notices the gray hair. you're not gonna have time to shave. i don't know where they are. good luck, darling. he's got gray hair. what the hell? don't swear. we're getting married. we are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of henry and clare. in the presence of family and friends and before god, they exchange these vows: to have and to hold from this day forward, for richer or for poorer... ...for better or for worse, in sickness and in health. and now i'd like to invite my lovely daughter... ...and my gallant new son-in-law to the dance floor. "love will tear us apart" slowly] howdy, stranger. sorry i missed the ceremony. you didn't. do you wish i was him? but you are. "love will tear us apart"] clare: i wonder if i'm a bigamist. i think you're allowed to marry the same person as many times as you want. oh, no. don't. finally. clare. who'd you expect? i brought you a turkey leg. our cook roasts the best turkey around. well, that's what everyone says, anyway. my dad was saving it for lunch. he's been ignoring me, so i really didn't think he deserved it. he's been ignoring my mom too. alicia says they're really gonna get a divorce this time. they're not. you never told me anything like that before. well, i don't want you to worry if you don't have to. maybe they should get a divorce. yeah, maybe. are you married? yes, i am. is your wife a time traveler? no. no, thank god. do you love her? yes. very much. what's wrong? nothing. i was just hoping you're married to me. did you ever think about time? it goes, alec. that's the business of time. tick, tick, tick-- i was with you in the meadow. you were? you were jealous of my wife. i was. i used to try and convince myself... ...that you were married to someone fat with a mustache. well, that is my type. clare: come on, let's do this. that's great, guys. thanks. you're welcome. clare: honey? man: get him, charlie. drop it. man: get back here, you son of a bitch. you're back. did i miss christmas? yeah. and new year's. henry, you've been gone two weeks. i couldn't get back. i tried everything. even got drunk trying to trigger it. guess that didn't work. um, i have to go. now? i just got here. i know, but i have a show in two weeks. jeremy gave me a space to work in. i mean, this place is too small. i can't work here anymore. and, henry, my life doesn't stop because you're gone. i never said it did. could we talk about this? talk? i have been here for two weeks wanting to talk to you. what do you wanna talk about? i mean, how bad it feels to sit here and wait for you? i'm going to work. jeremy: this is gonna be great. have no worries. clare: all right. thank you, sir. jeremy: good night. clare: good night. woman: yeah, i can't believe that. man: yeah. we'll never make it in time. in time for what? somewhere in america, moments from now, there could be a new multimillionaire. good evening, everybody. i'm dave long. it's tuesday.... clare: you can't be in here. henry: we have to watch something. clare: the tvs are gonna set you off. henry: we have to watch something. clare: what's that? good luck. what'd you do? our first winning number is... seventeen. up next: maybe a 23. or even a 32. thirty-two is next. couldn't possibly be a 40. that shouldn't be a 12. ...a 12. so here are your winning numbers: seventeen, 23, 32, 40 and 12. you just won $5 million. you can't do that. it's-- it's cheating. okay. let's rip it up. no. look, there are a lot of downsides to my condition, okay? but this is not one of them. realtor: exquisite plasterwork in every room of the house. isn't it gorgeous? this is not it. but i like it. you'll like another one more. just look at the fireplace. it's got the "wow" factor. the details, the architecture, the windows. spectacular. no. not the one. uh, thank you. just look at this landscaping. wouldn't you love to see it in the spring? now, it's a little smaller than the other places, but big on charm. now, the main entrance of this house is actually towards the rear... ...where there is a charming garden. but look at these features. the fireplace. that staircase, it's so handsome. the wide-plank flooring. love that. clare. we're home. see the garage? uh-huh. that's your studio. aah! henry: come on. come on. come on. clare: so here's the garden. and over there is my studio. charisse: oh, my. gomez: things are going okay. charisse: this is.... clare: mint? yes. and black for you. gomez: mm-hm. how many more of these do you want? three's good. charisse: he's awake. he's kicking. max is kicking. clare: oh! do you know when you're gonna die? no. i've never seen you older. i've never seen you older than 40-something. never. maybe you stop-- maybe you stop traveling. somebody-- somebody finds a cure. there's gotta be some kind of drug you can take. there's gotta be someone.... something. something that can help. we're having a baby. what? i.... i think it's time. it's time you find dr. kendrick. how did you say you found me? when i'm older... ...i travel back in time to see my wife when she's a little girl. she says i mentioned a dr. kendrick. i found three in the chicago area: one an ent, one a podiatrist, so.... i'm a geneticist. and i have a genetic anomaly. it's called chrono-impairment. that's a term you came up with, apparently. that's what she says. of course, now i've mentioned it, you will call it that... ...and it'll be hard to tell which came first. you see, that's the thing about time travel. did my students put you up to this? because, man, you are good. oh, god. you got me. i knew this would be a waste of my time. wait a minute. uh, wait. here. henry, wait. hey. i lost the baby. kendrick. mr. detamble. my wife had a miscarriage. i am very sorry about that, but i don't see what i can do to help. what if the baby's a traveler like me? what if it has the same genetic anomaly? what if it traveled out of the womb? you need help. not the kind of help i can give you. how can i prove it to you? you can't. it's impossible. well, just do one test. if you don't find anything, fine. i'll leave you alone, you can go back to your life. i'm calling security. the grant. the berger grant. have you applied for it yet? how did you find out about that? you win. we're going to start the first series. it'll take about 10 minutes. oh, shit. your brain emits a blast of electromagnetic energy... ...akin to an epileptics right at the moment you travel. and you can see it right here. now, there are drugs for epilepsy we can use. but all of these drugs are way too strong for a fetus... ...if, indeed, it is a similar condition which is causing the miscarriage. i'm 10 weeks in now, and we've never been that far along... ...so maybe the baby isn't gonna travel. we're going to find out. we're going to take a look at henry's genetic code. we'd like to take a look at the clock genes. and then i would like to run the same test on the fetus. not to worry. it's a noninvasive extraction of cells. but perhaps we'll get some sort of indication... ...as how to bring you to full term. honey. what? wake up. you're bleeding. what? henry: we could adopt. what's wrong with me wanting one normal thing in my life? i wanna be a mother. i wanna bear a child, your child. why can't i have that? i've never seen us with a baby. never. i've traveled to the future... ...and i've never seen it. i don't wanna hear that. you heard what the doctor said. you'd be-- stop. okay, henry. uh, just to be official about this, i need to ask you one last time: you're sure you wanna do this? yeah, yeah. i've signed the papers. yeah. yeah, i know, but, uh, vasectomy's rarely a one-party decision. yeah, well, this time it is. nurse: you all right? you need us to call someone? no. nurse: a cab? clare: henry. hey. what's the matter? i don't really feel like being here right now. is it me? no. i did something. it was hard, and you won't like it. what'd you do? you won't like it. well, then why'd you do it? to stop us from fighting. we're fighting? why? well, just once, one time, could you--? could you tell me the answer to something i'm asking you? you wouldn't get it anyway. that wasn't very nice. you've never kissed me before. i was with you in the meadow. when? you looked about 18. it was our first kiss. hmm.... you were having a bad day. i did something. i did something i felt i had to do. oh, please don't tell me something that's gonna make me hate you. i had a vasectomy. i'm not gonna have a child... ...with the same genetic disorder as me who's gonna die. i-- i'm not gonna do it. how dare you? you tricked me. you-- you came to that meadow... ...and you forced yourself into the heart and the mind of a little girl. what, you think that i wanted this life... ...this husband that disappears without any kind of warning? do you think anyone would want that? who would want that? you have a choice. i never had a choice. hello? thanks for coming. it's freezing out there. where's henry? uh, i left him sleeping. i needed some time away from him. how's that working out for you? you okay? we had a fight. it was bad. yeah, well, he can be a pain in the ass, that guy. it's really good to see you. hi. hi. what's up with you? what? you're weird. been weird all week. i'm pregnant. do you remember the night in the parking lot? when i came to get you? you were younger. before the surgery. i mean, it's not like i cheated on you. if we lose this baby, if something happens to-- from now on... ...we're not gonna fight anymore. we're not even getting excited. i mean, if stress is what's causing the traveling... ...then we should give this baby the most serene gestation on the planet. eighteen weeks and perfectly healthy. and you asked about the sex. it's a girl. it's got a really strong heartbeat. what about "mia"?
