yeah. it's about 40 pounds, ain't it? no, 32. thirty-two. i'll tell you, it took every bit of strength i had... ...to hold it while the guy took the picture. every damn bit. probably that chain didn't help it any either. you didn't weigh the chain, did you, doc? no, i didn't weigh the chain, but damn, i'm awful proud of that picture. that's the first chinooker i ever caught. it's a nice one. hmm. randall patrick mcmurphy. thirty-eight years old. mm. what can you tell me about, uh... ...why you've been sent over here? well, ahem, i don't know. what's it say there? mind if i smoke? no, go right ahead. well, it, um... ...says several things here. said you've been belligerent... ...talked when unauthorized... ...you've been resentful in attitude toward work in general, that you're lazy. chewing gum in class. the real reason you've been sent over here... ...is because they wanted you to be evaluated. yeah. to determine whether or not... ...you're mentally ill. uh-huh. this is the real reason. why do you think they might think that? well, as near as i can figure out, it's because i, uh.... uh, fight and fuck too much. in the penitentiary? no, no, no, you mean why... wait... why did you get sent over here from the work farm? oh. oh, yeah. oh. uh.... well, i really don't know, doc. it says here that you went around... let me just take a look. it ain't up to me, you know. one, two, three, four.... you've got at least five arrests for assault. yeah. what can you tell me about that? five fights, huh? rocky marciano's got 40, and he's a millionaire. that's true. that is true. of course, it's true that you went in for statutory rape. that's true, is it not, this time? absolutely true. but, doc... ...she was 1 5 years old going on 35, doc... ...and, uh, she told me she was 1 8, and she was... ...uh, very willing. you know what i mean? mm. mm. i practically had to take... ...to sewing my pants shut. but, uh, between you and me, uh... ...she might have been 1 5. when you get that little red beaver... ...right up there in front of you, i don't think it's crazy at all. and i don't think you do either. i hear what you're saying. no man alive could resist that. that's why i got into jail to begin with. now they're telling me i'm crazy over here... ...because i don't sit there like a goddamn vegetable. it don't make a bit of sense to me. if that's what being crazy is... ...then i'm senseless, out of it, gone down the road, wacko. but no more, no less. that's it. well, to be honest with you, mcmurphy, what it says here... ...is that... ...they think.... they think... ...you've been faking it in order to get out of your work detail. what do you think about that? do i look like that kind of guy to you, doc? well.... let's just be frank for a minute, randall, if you would. tell me... ...do you think there's anything wrong with your mind, really? not a thing, doc. i'm a goddamn marvel of modern science. well, you're gonna be here for a period for us to evaluate you. we're gonna study you. mm-hm. we'll make our determinations as to what, uh, we're going to do... ...and give you the necessary treatment, uh... ...as indicated... doc, let me just tell you this. i'm here to cooperate with you 100 percent. a hundred percent. i'll be just right down the line with you. you watch. because i think we ought to get to the bottom of, uh, r.p. mcmurphy. inmate: whoo! the scythe. inmate: oh. i'm awfully tired. washington: sit down. i'm tired. well, sit down. inmate: oh. that better? washington: mr. ellsworth... ...you'll wear yourself out. come here. okay. ratched: at the close of friday's meeting... ...we were discussing mr. harding's problem concerning his wife. mr. harding stated that his wife made him uneasy... ...because she drew stares from men on the street. is that correct, mr. harding? yes. uh, yes. that's correct. he also thinks he may have given her reason... ...to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he wasn't able to say how. mr. harding has been heard to say to his wife: "i hate you. i don't ever want to see you again. you've betrayed me." so does anyone care to touch on this further? mr. scanlon, would you begin today? are you sure? billy, how about you? no... no... no, ma'am. ratched: i'd like to write in my book that you began the meeting. ratched: just once. mr. martini? are you with us? yes. ratched: would you like to begin? mr. cheswick? me? ratched: yes. you mean there's not a man here who has an opinion on this matter? ratched: all right. mr. harding... ...you've stated on more than one occasion... ...that you suspected your wife of seeing other men. oh, yes. yes, very much... i suspect her. i suspect her. well, maybe you can tell us why you suspect her. well, i can only... ...speculate as to the reasons why. have you ever speculated, mr. harding... ...that perhaps you are... ...impatient with your wife... ...because she doesn't meet your mental requirements? harding: perhaps, but you see, the only thing i can really... ...speculate on, nurse ratched... ...is the very existence of my life, with or without my wife... ...in terms of the human relationships, the juxtaposition... ...of one person to another, the form, the content. harding, why don't you knock off the bullshit and get to the point? this is the point. this is the point, taber. it's not bullshit. i'm not just talking about my wife, i'm talking about my life. i can't seem to get that through to you. i'm not just talking about one person, i'm talking about everybody. i'm talking about form. i'm talking about content. i'm talking about interrelationships. i'm talking about god, the devil, hell, heaven. do you understand? finally? ha! yeah, harding, you're so fucking dumb i can't believe it. oh. oh. it makes me feel very peculiar, very peculiar... ...when you throw in that. peculiar? why? what does that mean, peculiar, harding? peculiar? peculiar? peculiar? sefelt: ha-ha-ha. i'm going to tell you guys something. you just don't wanna learn anything. you just don't want to listen to anybody. he's got intelligence. you've never heard the word peculiar? say, what are you trying to say? you trying to say i'm queer? is that it? little mary ann? little marjorie jane? huh? that it? is that what you're trying to tell me? is that your idea of communicating something? well, is it? cheswick: oh. they're all crowding in on you, mr. harding. they're all ganging up on you. is that news? no, they... they sometimes wanna gang up on me too, but i... cheswick, do me a favor. cheswick: what? huh? take it easy. cheswick: take it...? and stay off my side. cheswick: but i only wanna... i only wanna help you. harding: i understand. cheswick: don't you want me to...? harding: please. cheswick: but i only wanna... please. but i only wanna help you. please! harding: you see... ...the other day you made some allusions, both of you. illusions? harding: a sexual... yes, allusions. allusions. not illusions. allusions... ...to sexual problems i might be having with my wife. all right, say it's true. say i know it to be true, but you don't. if that's your idea of trying to tell me something... harding, i think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. sefelt: peculiar. asshole again. fredrickson: it makes you feel peculiar. you been talking about your wife ever since i can remember. she's on your mind. blah, blah, blah. i'm not talking about my wife. when are you gonna get that through your head? when are you gonna wise up and turn her loose? fredrickson: please. sefelt: no, just peculiar. i'm tired. i don't wanna hear it. i don't wanna hear it. bancini: i'm tired. cheswick: i don't wanna hear it. i'm tired. it's a lot of baloney. cheswick: i don't wanna hear it. bancini: it's a lot of baloney and i'm tired. cheswick: i don't wanna hear it. warren: we know you're tired. we're tired. bancini: i'm tired and it's a lot of baloney. warren: you're not tired, bancini. bancini: take your hands off me. ever play this game, chief?

a little variety? well, it's not necessarily true, mr. mcmurphy. some men on the ward take a long, long time to get used to the schedule. change it now, and they might find it very disturbing. ah, fuck the schedule. they can go back to the schedule after the series. i'm talking about the world series, nurse ratched. huh? well, anyway, this is no way to proceed about this. how would it be if we had a vote... ...and let majority rule? great. let's vote on her. so all those in favor, raise your hands. okay, guys, come on. put your hands up. what's the matter with you?

why, my head would squash like an eggplant. fuck sefelt's head, i don't need sefelt's head. i'm gonna take this, put it through the window... ...and me and my buddy cheswick are gonna go out... ...downtown, sit down in a bar, wet our whistles... ...and watch the ball game. and that's the bet. now, does anybody want any of it? huh? you're gonna lift that thing? yeah. that's right. i'll bet a buck. taber, $1. i bet a dime. mac, you can't... can't li... lift that thing. anybody else want any of it? hard-on? hmm? i'll bet $25. twenty-five dollars, hard-on. mac! mac, no... nobody could ever lift that thing. get out of my way, son. you're using my oxygen. you know what i mean?

why can't we go on to some new business? huh? the business of this meeting, mr. cheswick... ...is therapy. oh. well, you know, i don't understand this, miss ratched... ...because, uh, i don't, uh.... mr. mcmurphy... ...he said something yesterday about a world series. a baseball game? you know, and i've never been to a baseball game... ...and, well, i think i'd like to see one... ...and that would be good therapy, too, wouldn't it, miss ratched? i thought we'd decided that issue. well, i don't think so, because, i mean... ...we discussed that yesterday... ...and we have a new game today, i think, don't we, mac? that's right, ches, and we want a new vote on it, don't we? would one more vote satisfy you, mr. mcmurphy? yeah. it'll satisfy me. there's a vote before the group. everyone in favor of changing the schedule, please raise your hand. okay, i wanna see the hands. come on. which one of you nuts has got any guts? all right. that's it. i only count nine votes, mr. mcmurphy. ha-ha-ha. she only counts nine. only nine. it's a landslide. there are 18 patients on this ward, mr. mcmurphy... ...and you have to have a majority to change ward policy. so you gentlemen can put your hands down now. are you trying to tell me that you're gonna count these?
