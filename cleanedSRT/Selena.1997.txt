we've been talking and we'd rather go outside and play. i mean, not this play, but play as in "run." you can play outside in an hour. play it! no way! why not? it's the '50s! that song's way out of style! the '50s are over! we want to play stuff we like. stuff that's cool! stuff that's happening. show me what's happening. shut up! come on, dad. look at you guys. fifteen minutes. fifteen minutes of real playing. abie, selena. okay. go ahead, count it off. that's better. you know, i've been thinking. here in lake jackson, there are a lot of gringos. what? we wanted something better for the kids. better than the barrio. yeah, but... there are no mexican restaurants here. and gringos love mexican food. are you thinking of opening a restaurant? yes, i am. there's a lot of money to be made. you've got a good job. i mean a good restaurant. a steady job. we just bought this house! what are you thinking of? listen... i'm not going to quit my job, all right? but a good mexican restaurant... ay, abraham! never satisfied. there's enough room. always dreaming. put up a stage for some music. music? that's what this is about, isn't it? music! no, this is about food. okay? and i'm hungry. the kids could play. we'd be together. the clients would love it. you wouldn't quit your job, right? no, i wouldn't quit my job. oh, god. i gotta tell you, you got it centered. it looks great. but i don't buy that "g." the "g" is perfect. it looks like a "y"! it looks great. it looks like "papayoyo's"! it's "papagayo's." perfect. go back up. we're exhausted. look at the "y." "papa y"? it's "g." it's "papagayo." it says, "papayoyo's." come on. let's go home. go ahead. look. okay, stay. stay! out the way, i'll do it. let me do it. i want to do it. if you don't let me do it... watch out! how's it going?

i'm looking up at the moon. and i'm dreaming. about? let's just say you wouldn't imagine what my dreams are like. when i saw those people applauding... i mean, what did you feel? what did you think? it was so cool. i've never seen so many people smile before. it was exciting. i know. it was. when i'm up on stage, i feel like i can be anything i want to be. don't steal them all! don't hog the candy! selena, come here. come here. come here. look at this. come on, dad. please. i want to go outside and play. come on, just a second. give me a minute, okay? here, look at this. what's this? it's a song in spanish. i don't know spanish. put your tongue on the roof of your mouth, then blow air out. did you feel it? do it again. perfect. that means, "clock, don't mark the hours because i'm going nuts." i know, it sounds weird in english... dad, what's this about? it's about learning to sing in spanish. i don't want to sing in spanish. i don't like spanish music. i like donna summer. that's what i like. you like performing? yeah, dad, i love it. it's like you can feel them when you sing. it's a wonderful feeling. but let me tell you something i learned the hard way. i don't want you to learn the hard way. when i was singing with los dinos, one time they started throwing beer bottles at me. it sounds funny, but it scared me. but i did learn something. you've got to be who you are. you can't change it. you're an american. i'm an american. you like donna summer. i like doo-wop. but you're also mexican, deep inside. that's a wonderful thing. you can't be anything if you don't know who you are. if you're a singer, you must sing to people from deep inside here. you know what's in there? your heart. so you're saying i gotta learn how to sing this stuff. remember, "clock, don't mark the hours because i'm going nuts." i don't understand. we were doing so good the first nine months. it's that ronald reagan. reaganomics. a lot of small businesses have gone broke. come on, abraham. let's go home, huh? i don't want to leave my home. me either. do you know how many cousins we have at uncle hector's? come on, let's go. abie, are my keys in there? i don't think so. check the house. dad, your keys are in the car. what? your keys are in the car. the keys are on the seat. get in the car. i'm coming. put your seat belt on. do we have to go to uncle hector's? she's nine years old. she's great. you gotta believe me. she's got all the moves. she's a natural performer. sings from the heart. no, freddie, listen, please. i don't care about the money. i just want to get them some exposure. they play everything. freddie, this is familia. you gotta do it. you guys did so good. come downstairs. you did good. you gotta pick it up. the rhythm wasn't fast enough. we have bad material. they weren't dancing because you weren't playing it right. abraham, the kids did great. the kids did great. they did great. i'm proud of you. you did really good! if you'd like to write the songs, be my guest. until then, just keep the rhythm up, so they can dance. we need to talk, okay? go on! it's okay. we'll be there in a minute. come here. what're we doing? what are we doing to our kids? the kids are good, and they'll get better. the kids are kids. they're children! we should be taking care of them, not hurting them. selena is just a little girl. even if she keeps going and keeps singing... tejano music is all men. you know that. women are not successful. marcela, everything you're saying i understand. but she is special. she's got it. i can feel it. i know it. she's going to make it. come on, i'm sorry. i'm sorry. you're thinking that after what happened at harlingen, we should quit. yes. let me just tell you something. you guys are going to make it. you're going to record records. you're going to play everywhere, even disney worid. disney worid? you think we'll make it there? i know you will. i also know how hard it is to make it in the music business. but every star that's a star right now had their harlingen once. and if we try hard and if we really want it we can do it. do you believe me? yeah, daddy. i believe you. you hear that music? that's a cumbia. a cumbia? it's a dance dad and i danced when we were young. we did. she used to do the washing machine. want me to show you? come here. watch that. first we start moving your hips like this. then bigger. bigger. add a little hop. there you go. do the washing machine! wait a minute! there you go. you get the washing machine going. your father likes it. that's the washing machine. there you go! you make a little circle. and spin. there you go! how does the bass sound?

"i eat medium pizzas by myself with lots of pepperoni. that's important. "and i drink cokes and scarf doritos and never exercise." you're too much. what're you doing? hot sauce. that is enough. they can't make food hot enough for me. you are going to be sorry. watch this. that was good. i need soda. you are so tough. you are so strong. what a macho man. want some?

after all these years, all of a sudden, bang! that's how it is, i tell you. you start from here, then it's like a bullet. abie's really smart. he really knows his cumbia rhythms. he adds a little funk and disco. then you sing the heck out of it. you add a little heavy metal to the guitar. i can do that. dude, i was just thinking. i've never seen you dance. do you dance? dance? yeah, i dance. i put on my white shoes and black jacket and dance like travolta. yeah, we can dance to this. let me see you dance. i was just kidding. come on, let me see you dance. don't be shy. i won't tell anyone that you weren't being cool. you get them disgruntled... they're always disgruntled. i'll be making a pit stop in about five more minutes. follow me. give me a little james brown. i got soul. do you? you banged me. i'm sorry. come on, this is a cumbia rhythm. i've never seen you dance... wait. i don't think we should be doing this. i'm not sure we should either. i'm sorry. is he gone? yep. do you think he'll tell? i don't think so. that sounds good, dude. thanks, man. want a beer? sure. all right. don't worry about it. i won't say anything. i know you're cool, man. if it gets serious, there'll be trouble. abraham won't like selena getting serious with a guy now. with a guy like you. what do you mean, a guy like me? dude, you're my boy, right? we're cool? but we're musicians. we both know what you're like. and selena, she's like a sister to me. i don't know. it's different with her. she makes me feel different. i don't know what it is. i can't explain it. mom, he is so cute. i don't know what it is. he just makes me feel different. like, i get butterflies when i think about him. girl, i could tell you like him. and you know what? i think he's cute, too. mom, he is so funny. he hardly talks. no, you have to get to know him. i'm serious. when we're together, we just laugh and laugh at stupid things. you can't tell dad. don't worry. i was a young girl, too, remember? you promise? i won't tell. now get off the bed. you're messing up my pillow. they want us to play in mexico? a gig in monterrey, mexico! that would be so cool. i'm not sure of that. come on, dad. you always said everything's a risk. they don't accept us there. never have. we're mexican! no, we're mexican-american and they don't like mexican-americans. and they can be mean and they can tear us apart there. and selena's spanish is... what about it? i've been singing in spanish for 10 years. it's perfect. singing, yes. but you speak it a little funny. there you must speak perfectly or the press will eat you alive. i've seen them do it. overreacting as usual. the music will speak for itself. being mexican-american is tough. anglos jump all over you if you don't speak english perfectly. mexicans jump all over you if you don't speak spanish perfectly. we must be twice as perfect as anybody else. why're you laughing? what's so funny? nothing. i'm serious. our family has been here for centuries. yet they treat us as if we just swam across the rio grande. we must know about john wayne and pedro infante. we must know about frank sinatra and agustin lara. we must know about oprah and cristina. anglo food is too bland. and yet, in mexico we get the runs. now that, to me, is embarrassing. japanese-americans, italian-americans, german-americans... their homeland is across the ocean. ours is right next door. right over there. we must prove to the mexicans how mexican we are. prove to the americans we're american. we must be more mexican than mexicans, more american than americans, both at the same time! it's exhausting. damn! nobody knows how tough it is to be mexican-american. now you're making me hungry. come on, dad. i can do it. i know i can. really. trust us. listen, guys. let's finish the tour in california and then we'll talk about it. but being mexican-american is really hard. security! what's going on in here? we'll pay for everything, and i do mean everything. you think that'll make it right? no. you do this everywhere you go? he's fired. i never want to see him again. you can't do that. we're not a disgusting punk rock group! i know that, dad! look, trust me! where is he? i don't know. he's fired! you can't. we're going to mexico. i don't want to see his face again. there's no way we're going to find a new guitarist before then. it's impossible. chris! what was that all about? what's with you, huh? why are you trying to spoil everything? i'm no good for you. it'll never work. i wish everyone would stop telling me what's good for me! i gotta hear it from dad, mom, abie, and now you? maybe you should listen to them. stop telling me what i should want! you don't know who i really am! you don't know anything about me! and that's you up there? big hot-shot rock-and-roller, got to trash hotel rooms? i've been around musicians all my life. i'm not impressed. and i do know who you are. i can see you. you're just chris. i want it to work, okay? but it just... but what? you know what your problem is? you can't accept something great even when it stares you in the face. i may not be streetwise and all that. but at least i know not to be that dumb! her spanish. if only she could just keep singing! when we get out there, let me do all the talking, okay? let me handle this. okay? i've got an idea. ...excited! are they shouting for me? they are shouting for you. m'hija, you going to wear your jacket? no, no. have a good show. there's over 100,000 people here. we were expecting 10,000. order extra security people this minute. they're going onstage already. the police are sending extra help. we were not prepared for a crowd this big. i've never seen anything like it. that's enough! stop! get off! everybody, get off! this is crazy! are you okay? the stage was collapsing! they're pushing the stage! it's out of control. it is too dangerous. the stage'll crack. you can't stop the concert. i won't let them play if this will happen! lt'll cause a riot! they're my kids! they're in danger! we need you to settle this crowd down. can you do it? yeah. are you sure? yeah, i can do it. get out there. quickly. come on. but start it slow. you got it. front page! we're on so many covers! you said we couldn't do it! what is dad doing? listen to this. "selena is the genuine artist of the people." you're an artist! i've never seen so many people before. i've never been scared by a crowd, not even when i was nine. but then you started to sing and they all loved you. sometimes i think about the things i never had. i never had a normal childhood. i finished high school by mail. spent more time in big bertha than i have anywhere else. but when i was on that stage it was like nothing i ever felt before. it's hard to describe. i just had this feeling like my dreams were the same as the dreams of all those people in the audience. like all their hopes were centered on me. and i just felt lucky. i felt really lucky. i know why they love you so much. oh, yeah? why? because i love you, too. i mean it. you're my best friend. i can talk about anything and you understand. i've thought a lot about what you said to me that night in l.a. by the dumpsters. i don't want to be that dumb. i don't want to lose you. i don't want to lose you either. when i was five years old and my parents split up every day i've remembered the feeling i had when i knew my father wasn't coming back. until i met you. i don't feel like that anymore. i love you. i love you, too. oh, i'm sorry. i have a surprise for you. you do? want to see it? hold on! wait for me. okay. everybody off the bus. what's going on? off the bus. get off! you, stay in. you, stay in. get off. this is over, right now. what do you mean? this. you and him. it's over. you can't tell us what to do. i can tell you anything i want. i know who you are. i come from the streets. i know what a bum musician is. don't talk to him like that! i can say anything i want to say to him! i won't have this in my family. let's get this straight. you're not to see each other like this again. i'm not agreeing to anything. you can't tell me who i can and can't... you wait! you'll ruin your career and your life! you're 20! give yourself time! i don't care what you say! it doesn't matter! i love him! what did you say? i said i love him. and he loves me. of course he does! you're young, you're beautiful and you're rich! you would say that! it's not like that! he cares about me. the real me. inside! there is no way i'll let you take that away. we're not going to stop seeing each other. you listen to me! if you think i'll allow you to mess up my family ruin everything we've worked for, you're wrong! i respect your family. i don't want to ruin anything. i love selena and we want to get married. that's right. we want to get married. that's it! you're fired! do you hear me? you can ride back home, but after that you're fired! i can make my own way. you cannot do this, dad! i'm not going to let you do this! let me go! listen to me. you all listen to me! if you follow that man, i will disband the group! there will be no more selena y los dinos. do you understand me? do you all understand me? it's over! it's okay. you're too young to get married. you and dad were just as young when you got married. younger. it was different back then, selena. what was so different? i was the daughter of poor farm workers. we didn't have any choices. in those days there was no other way. but you and dad have been happy, right? yes. yes. i love your father very much. but i wanted something different for my daughters. a chance to see things. i know it seems like forever to you now. but believe me, it's the right thing. but i love him, mom. i love him. it's okay. selena! selena, selena! i hate this. can't even go to a burger joint without worrying about someone seeing us and it getting back to dad. pass the hot sauce. it's in the glove compartment. don't worry about it. just give it time. where are you going next? i don't know. el paso tomorrow. some big gig. they keep me busy between gigs, too. today i have to go to the waterpark with sara. i had to talk fast just to go shopping alone. and you're here with me. he says he'll break up the band if we keep seeing each other. so what? i can do other things. i can design clothes. i've always wanted to do that. you don't want to quit music. no. making it to the big time is important to you. i mean, being big in mexico and doing that whole english crossover thing. you once felt like everyone's hopes and dreams were centered on you. it means a lot to you, right? it does. what if they're right? about us getting married. they feel like it's going to hurt the act, not just abraham. abie, ricky, pete, joe, suzy. they all think that. let's do that velcro thing over there. want to go on that? the spider web thing? that one there. yeah! that's cool! we can all do it together. how about that? sel, you're so full of it. you wouldn't do that. dare me. i dare you. don't dare her! wait! i was just kidding! i'm going! sel, wait a second! what're you doing? shouldn't have dared me. get off! come on! have you lost your mind? this isn't funny! come down! what're you doing? see you later. nobody's laughing! get down here! if you look down, you won't do it. step back. right hand on the side. left hand on the other side. come on. the hardest part is letting go. what're you doing here? i've had it! i've had it! i can't take it anymore! el paso is 12 hours away. you should be getting on the bus. i don't care! you mean more to me than any gig in el paso! your father'll know that you're here. let him know! let him! okay? i'm tired of hiding from him. i'm tired, too. but everything's going to get messed up this way. can't you just hold me? i don't want it messed up. do you want to be with me? of course i do. do you want to be with me forever? forever. you're it for me. let's do it. let's get married now. married? that's crazy. you don't want to marry me? of course i want to. but the right way. what's that? with you wearing a beautiful white dress and your friends in those different colored dresses. bridesmaids, chris. yeah, bridesmaids and lots of flowers and your family. i don't care about all that! it's not the important thing! i know it's important to you to have your family at your wedding. and it's important to me, too. because i care for you. you're right. i would love that. to have a big wedding. and my dad give me away. that would mean more to me than anything. but it's never going to happen. i know him, chris. i know what he's like. and he will never accept us! never! all right? he's dug his heels in and that's it. the whole worid, all corpus christi could tumble down and he wouldn't budge! the only way he will know i am not going to give you up is if we go out and get married right now. then he'll have to accept us. but what if he doesn't? i'll still have you. and you'll have me. and there's no gig in the worid more important than that. i love you. let's get married. yeah? yeah. how does it feel to be married? it feels great. i like it. but it also feels like i don't know what we got ourselves into. look, don't worry. okay? you don't know what it's like to be a quintanilla. we're tight. like this. and i'll talk to my dad. i'll find the right way to tell him. okay? okay, sel, but listen. just in case things are not okay, i can take care of you. i can make up to $400 a week doing sessin work, and bands want me. i can take care of you. i love you. see? that's my macho man talking! i love you, too! i love you! lt'll be okay. it's on the radio already. don't go to corpus! go the other way! where will we go, alaska? anywhere but corpus! we just have to give him a day. i know my dad. tomorrow. i'll talk to him tomorrow. wait here. good luck. dad, i know you're angry. come in. sit down and shut the door. when i found out yesterday what you had done i went crazy. i didn't know what to do. i went for a walk on the beach to where i took you when you were a little girl. i remember. i sat there for hours and i cried. i cried like a baby. dad, i didn't mean to... listen. this might sound a little strange, but... i'm glad you did it. it was a great weight on my shoulders. i forced you into it. no, you didn't. listen. i can be stubborn. you did what you had to do. but i wanted what was best for you. i know that. i think that's why i knew it was going to be okay. you know that day on the bus when chris said he loved you? yeah. i know he meant it. he did mean it. we both love each other very much. but it scared me. i don't know how to let you go. dad. i just want you to be happy. i love you, dad. chris! we don't need the getaway car?

why not? yeah, but what about the singing and the touring? i mean, you want to give it up? no, of course not. but we could take the kids along with us. it's a family act, right? so, you're talking kids, a career, and a farm with lots of animals. yeah. why not? anything's possible. kids, huh? okay. let's do it. yeah? yeah. let's get started! go, go, go! you forgot the food! hey, dad. what is so important you had to drag me over here? selena, we got a problem and i don't even know where to start. it's yolanda. what? fans complained that they sent money to the fan club and received nothing. then we found out she had had a problem with a previous employer. what problem? because yolanda wouldn't do that. money problems. we didn't find out about it because they settled out of court. i went through the records of the fan club and found these checks. they're very suspicious. and what's worse, is a lot of the records are missing. selena, i'm worried. she's handling all the boutiques. i know. i don't know what to tell you. it's true. i did have a problem with a doctor i worked with. but i would never take anything from selena. never. i love selena. i don't remember these checks. what about the missing records? i don't know where they are. but i'll find them. i will. and i'll show you. we need an accounting of all the money. yolanda! how could you do this to me? i never took anything from you. i trusted you with everything i have. never. how could you do this to my fans? you know what they mean to me. please. give me a chance to prove it to you. please. scratch my head. please? you know, when we're finished touring for the crossover album, chris and i were thinking of having a baby. a baby? come here, baby. a baby. i'll be a grandma? not tomorrow. come here. i've been thinking about the crossover tour a lot. i've even had dreams about it. it's just this whole different worid for us. we've been working for this ever since we were kids. i guess i'm a little scared. are they going to love me? they're going to love you. now go to sleep. still no radial pulse. i can't put the gun down. i'm ashamed of what i've done. i don't deserve to live. look at what i've done to my best friend. i want to talk to my mother.
