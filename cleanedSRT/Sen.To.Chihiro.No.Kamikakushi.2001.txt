i can see you shaking. actually, i'm impressed you made it this far. but i'm sure you didn't do it on your own. let's thank whoever helped you. just who was it, dear? why don't you tell me. please! can't you give me a job? don't start that again. please, i just want to work. don't say that! why in world do you think i should give you a job? anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled crybaby... and you have no manners. this is a high-class place i'm running here. so there's no job for you. now get out. i've got all the lazy bums i need. or maybe i'll give you the most difficult job i've got... and work you until you breathe... your very last breath. oh, dear, you woke up the baby. mommy's here. be a good boy now. why are you still here? i told you to leave. i want you to give me a job, please! quiet down! you're scaring the baby. ooh! hi, sweetie. don't be angry. that's a good boy. i'm not leaving till you give me a job. okay. okay. just be quiet. here comes mommy. i'm coming to get you. sign your name away, and i'll put you to work. if i hear one little complaint out of you... you'll be joining your parents in the pigpen. so i... do i sign my name here? i can't believe i took that oath. give a job to anyone who asks. ridiculous. i hate being so nice all the time. ha! so, your name's chihiro. what a pretty name. and it belongs to me now. yes, ma'am. right. what's your name? what? chih... oh. it's sen. okay, sen. follow me. haku, uh... don't talk to me, and address me as master haku. i don't care if yubaba gets angry with us. we're not taking humans. she's already under contract. what? i promise to work very hard. we are not gonna take her in our department. she'll stink up the whole place. we don't want her. three days of eating our food, and her smell will go away. if she doesn't work hard, roast her, boil her, do whatever you want. now get back to work. where is rin?

now, keep on your toes, and if you need anything, ask me. okay? okay. hmm? what's wrong? i don't feel so good. so, this is our room. a little food and some sleep and you'll be fine. here's your apron. you have to wash it yourself. your pants. you're so puny. way too big. rin, you know haku? there aren't two of him here, are there? two hakus? i can barely stand one. too big. he's yubaba's henchman. don't trust anything he says. ah, here we go. wh-what's wrong with you? are you feeling okay? quiet down. what's your problem? it's the new girl. she doesn't feel so good. meet me at the bridge. i'll take you to your parents. my shoes are gone. huh? thank you. follow me. we don't have much time. if you're found here, you'll be turned into a pig yourself. you must never come here without me. understand? i understand. mom, dad, are you all right? it's me, sen. hey, wake up! what's wrong with them? are they sick? no. they ate too much. they're sleeping it off. don't you worry, i promise i'll get you out of here. so just don't get any fatter or they'll eat you! here are your clothes. hide them. i thought they'd been thrown away. you'll need them to get home. my good-bye card's still here. chihiro. chihiro. that's my name, isn't it? that's how yubaba controls you... by stealing your name. so hold on to that card. keep it hidden. while you're here, you must call yourself sen. i can't believe i forgot my name. she almost took it from me. if you completely forget it, you'll never find your way home. i've tried everything to remember mine. you can't remember your name?

yeah. i thought he was a customer. what? he's a monster. he's already swallowed three people. found it! here it is, sen. hey, we're busy, boiler man. you can use this. you've got train tickets? uh, how did you get a hold of them? i've been saving them for 40 years. now, listen carefully. the train stop you want is called swamp bottom. swamp bottom? sixth stop. make sure you get it right. the train used to run in both directions... but these days it's a one-way ride. still want to go? yep. i'll walk back along the tracks. sen, what about no-face? i'll take care of that now. haku, i'll be back soon. just hold on. what's going on? something you wouldn't recognize. it's called "love." he just keeps getting bigger! i'm scared. i don't wanna be eaten by it. it's her. oh, sen, thank goodness. yubaba can't hold him off much longer. hurry! this way! madam, sen is here now. finally! sen has arrived, sir. she'll be with you in just a few minutes. he's destroying everything. it's costing us a fortune. so suck up to him and get every last speck of gold he's... ew! what's that dirty mouse doing here?

can you tell me what's going on? you blacked out, remember? yeah, i remember being in darkness. then i could hear sen's voice calling out my name. so i followed her voice, and the next thing i knew... i was lying here feeling better than ever. pure love. it broke zaneba's spell. sen left to return the golden seal. she did it to save you. sen didn't get nearly enough. she'll have to be punished. madam, you see, sen was the one that saved us from no-face. yes, yes. so what? this whole mess is her fault. and now she's run away from here. she's even abandoned her own parents! wait a minute. huh? master haku? you're still alive? what is it you want? you still haven't noticed that something precious to you has been replaced. don't get fresh with me, young man. since when do you talk that way to your master? huh. my baby! no! my baby! it's just dirt. where's my baby? where are you, sweetie? come out! please, come out! where are you? sweetie! sweetie pie! you! where is he? what did you do with my baby? he's with your sister. zaneba? uh... very clever, haku. i get it. you'll get my baby back for me, but at a price. so, what do you want? tear up sen's contract. and then i want you to return sen and her mother and father back to the human world. fine, but on one condition. i hope this is the right stop. let's go. you can ride on my shoulder if you're tired. hmm? hello? come on. so, you all made it. hmm? sit down. i'll make some tea. excuse me, ma'am. haku stole this from you. i came to give it back. i see. do you have any idea what this is? yes. it's the golden seal you were looking for. i'm here to apologize for haku. i'm very sorry. he sliced me in two, you know, and i'm still angry. what? what? the protective spell is gone. i'm sorry. you mean that black slug that was on your seal? i think i squashed it with my foot. squashed it? that wasn't my slug. my sister put that slug into haku so she could control him. you squashed it. what happened to my spell? only love can break it. come, now. can you please turn these two back into their normal forms? the spell on those two wore off long ago. change back if you want. i don't get along with my sister. she's so obnoxious. you saw how tacky her home is. we're identical twins, yet exact opposites. i'm sorry she turned your parents into pigs. but there's nothing i can do. it's just the way things are. you'll have to help your parents and haku on your own. use what you remember about them. what? can't you please give me more of a hint than that? it seems like i met haku before, but it was a long time ago. that's a good start. once you've met someone, you never really forget them. it just takes a while for your memories to return. no-face, where did you learn to spin thread? you're really good at this. knit one, pearl two. knit one, pearl two. knit one... that's right. granny, i can't remember anything at all. haku could be dead already, and i'm just sitting around here. my mom and dad could've been eaten for dinner. wait just a little bit longer. ahh. there we go. use it to tie back your hair. it's beautiful. it'll protect you. it's made from the threads your friends wove together. thank you. what good timing. we've got another guest. will you let him in? sure. haku! haku. thank goodness. you're alive! i can't believe it. how did it happen? ahh. that's love for you. look, granny. haku's alive. haku, i will forgive you for stealing my precious seal. but in return, you must take care of this girl. okay, you two, it's time to go home. come back soon. no-face, why don't you stay with me? i could use a good helper. granny! thank you so much. i'll miss you. don't worry. you'll be all right, sen. i want you to know my real name. it's chihiro. chihiro. what a pretty name. you take good care of it. i will. off you go. okay. bye. granny, take care! thanks for everything! haku, listen. i just remembered something from a long time ago. i think it may help you. and when i tried to get it back, i fell in. i thought i'd drown, but the water carried me to shore. it finally came back to me. the river's name was the kalaku river. you did it, chihiro! i remember. i was the spirit of the kalaku river. a river spirit? my name is the kalaku river. they filled in that river. it's all apartments now. that must be why i can't find my way home, chihiro. i remember you falling into my river, and i remember your little pink shoe. so you're the one who carried me back into shallow water. you saved me. i knew you were good. hey, there they are! i see you failed to bring my baby back. mama! my baby! are you traumatized? did they do terrible things to you? you're standing all by yourself. when did that happen? don't forget your promise. you must return chihiro and her parents to the human world. hmph! not so fast, haku. i get to give sen one final test. shut up! stop it, mama. leave her alone. sen and i had a really good time. but a deal is a deal, sweetie. i have to give sen one final test. if you make sen cry, i won't like you anymore. but... granny? you're right. a deal's a deal. okay, i'm ready. i'll take your test. hmm. you've got guts. i've got your contract right here. come this way. this'll only take a minute. don't worry. see if you can tell which of these pigs is your mother and father. you get one try. if you get it right, you can all go home. huh? there must be a mistake. none of these pigs are my mom or dad. none of them? is that really your answer? mm-hmm. oh, you got it! thank you, everyone. all right, you win. get out of my sight. thanks for everything, granny. good-bye! thank you! haku! let's go! where are my mom and dad? when you passed the test... they woke up on the human side of the river. they're there now, and they're looking for you. there's no water here. i can walk across now. but i can't go any farther. just go back the way you came. you'll be fine. but you have to promise not to look back, not until you've passed through the tunnel. what about you? what'll you do? don't worry. i'll go back and have a talk with yubaba. i'll tell her i'm going to quit being her apprentice. i'm fine. i got my name back. will we meet again sometime? sure we will. promise? promise. now go, and don't look back. where have you been? hurry up! you shouldn't run off like that, honey. you could get in big trouble. are you guys sure you're all right? chihiro, hurry up. everybody, watch your step. chihiro, don't cling like that. you'll make me trip. we made it. hey, what happened? what is it? look at that. it's all dusty inside too. is this someone's idea of a joke?
