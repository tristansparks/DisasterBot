jimmy? what's up? did i hit something? what the fuck is that? maybe you got a flat? no. what the fuck? you better pull over and see. he's still alive. you fucking piece of shit! die, you motherfucker! look at me! as far back as i can remember, l always wanted to be a gangster. to me. . . being a gangster was better than being president of the united states. even before i first wandered into the cabstand for an after- school job. . . l knew l wanted to be a part of them. lt was there that l knew l belonged. to me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies. they weren't like anybody else. they did whatever they wanted. they double- parked in front of a hydrant, nobody ever gave them a ticket. in the summer, when they played cards all night. . . nobody ever called the cops. tony stacks. how are you? tuddy cicero. could this be the canarsie kid? how are you? good. tuddy. tuddy ran the cabstand and the beiia vista pizzeria. . . and other places for his brother, paul, who was the boss of the neighborhood. paulie might have moved slow. . . but it was only because paulie didn't have to move for anybody. it's your fault. you started it. i started it? it's your fault. at first my parents loved that l found a job across the street from the house. my father, who was lrish, was sent to work at the age of 1 1 . he liked that l got myself a job. he always used to say that american kids were spoiled lazy. bye, dad. bye. see you, mikey. bye, henry. henry! watch how you cross! bring back milk! my mother was happy after she found out that the ciceros. . . came from the same part of sicily as she did. to my mother. . . that was the answer to all her prayers. i was the iuckiest kid in the worid. l could go anywhere, l could do anything. l knew everybody, and everybody knew me. wiseguys would pull up and tuddy would toss me their keys. . . and let me park their cadillacs. here i am, this iittie kid, l can't even see over the steering wheel. . . and l'm parking cadillacs. but it wasn't too long. . . before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand. for your mother and sister. for them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part- time job. but for me. . . it was definitely full- time. that's aii i wanted to do. people like my father could never understand, but l was a part of something. l belonged. l was treated like a grown- up. tell him 51 9. every day l was learning to score. a doiiar here, a doiiar there. l was living in a fantasy. have a good day at school? my father was always pissed off. pissed that he made such lousy money. . . pissed that my kid brother michael was in a wheeichair. he was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house. tell me about this. it's a letter from school. it says you haven't been there in months. in months! you're a bum ! want to grow up to be a bum? after a while, he was mostly pissed because l hung around the cabstand. he knew what went on at that cabstand. every once in a while, l'd have to take a beating. but by then, l didn't care. the way l saw it. . . everybody takes a beating sometime. i can't make any more deliveries. what? you'll fuck everything up. my dad says he'll kill me. look. come on with me. is that him, kid? no. how about him? no. that's the guy. get him. excuse me. scumbag. come here, you piece of shit. know this kid? yeah. know where he lives? yeah. you deliver mail to his house? yeah. from now on, any letter from that school to his house comes directly here. understand? yeah. another letter from that school goes to that kid's house. . . in the fucking oven you'll go, head first. that was it. no more ietters from truant officers. no ietters from schooi. ln fact, no more letters from anybody. finally after a few weeks, my mother went to the post office to complain. how could l go to school after that. . . and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit? paulie hated phones. he wouidn't have one in his house. mickey called. want me to call him back? all right, make the call. he got all his calls second hand. then you'd have to call the people back. . . from an outside phone. got a nickel? get him on the phone. there were guys, that's all they did all day, was take care of paulie's calls. for a guy who moved all day long, paulie didn't talk to six people. lf there was a union problem or, say, a beef in the numbers. . . only the top guys could meet with paulie to discuss the problem. everything was one- on- one. pauiie hated conferences. he didn't want anybody hearing what he said. . . and he didn't want anybody listening to what he was being told. hundreds of guys depended on paulie, he got a piece of everything they made. lt was a tribute, like in the old country, except they were doing it in america. all they got from paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off. that's what it's aii about. that's what the fbi couid never understand. what paulie and the organization does. . . is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops. that's it. that's all it is. they're like the police department for wiseguys. people looked at me differently, and they knew l was with somebody. l didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on sunday mornings for fresh bread. the owner knew who i was with. . . and he'd come from around the counter. no matter how many were waiting. . . i was taken care of first. our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore. . . even though we didn't have a car. at 1 3. . . l was making more money than most of the grown- ups around. l had more money than l could spend. i had it aii. one day, some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home. you know why? lt was out of respect. hi, mom, what do you think? look at my shoes, aren't they great? my god. you look like a gangster. they shot me. help! henry, shut the door. that was the first time l had ever seen anyone shot. can't have that in here. jesus christ! i can't have that in this joint. l remember feeling bad about the guy. . . but l also remember feeling that maybe tuddy was right. i knew pauiie didn't want anybody dying in the building. you're a real jerk. you wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy. what the hell's wrong with you? i got to toughen this kid up. lt was a glorious time. and wiseguys were all over the place. lt was before apalachin and before crazy joe. . . decided to take on a boss and start a war. it was when i met the worid. and it was when i first met jimmy conway. he couidn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time. . . but he was already a legend. he'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild. he'd give the doorman $1 00 just for opening the door. he'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games. the bartender got $1 00 just for keeping the ice cubes cold. the irishman is here to take all you guineas' money. want a drink? give me a 7 and 7. i'd like you to meet the kid henry. how you doing? thank you. keep them coming. jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city. he was first locked up at 1 1 . . . and he was doing hits for mob bosses when he was 1 6. see, hits never bothered jimmy. it was business. but what jimmy really loved to do. . . what he really loved to do was steal. he actually enjoyed it. jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies. give me your wallet. you might know who we are, but we know who you are. understand? he was one of the city's biggest hijackers. . . of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters. shrimp and lobsters were best. they went really fast. almost all of them were gimmies. they just gave it up, no problem. they called him jimmy the gent. help the lady. drivers ioved him. they used to tip him off. . . about the really good loads. of course, everybody got a piece. thanks, i'll be back for the rest later. okay, see you later. henry, come here. say hello to tommy. how're you doing, henry? you're gonna be working together, okay? help him. go ahead. jimmy, you got anything good? and when the cops assigned a whole army to stop jimmy, what did he do? how're you doing? he made them partners. i'd complain, but who'd listen? one pall mall. there you go. what do you need? two luckies. here you go, henry. thanks a lot. what do you need? one pall mall. one pall mall, here you go. what are you doing? it's all right. you have permission from your mother? how many cartons you need? where'd you get the cigarettes? get him out of here. it's okay. it's not okay. you don't understand. you don't understand. store's closed. henry got pinched. where? by the factory, selling cigarettes. henry hill. the people of the state of new york vs. henry hill. docket number 7041 62. yes, sir. that's me. just stand there. now stay there. counselor, proceed. congratulations. here's your graduation present. what for? i got pinched. everyone does, but you did it right. you told them nothing, and they got nothing. i thought you'd be mad. i'm not mad, i'm proud of you. you took your first pinch like a man and learned the two greatest things in life. what? look at me. never rat on your friends. . . and always keep your mouth shut. here he is. you broke your cherry. congratulations! by the time l grew up, there was $30 biiiion a year in cargo... moving through ldlewild airport. . . and beiieve me, we tried to steal every bit of it. see, you gotta understand, we grew up near the airport. lt belonged to paulie. we had friends and reiatives who worked all over the place. they would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out. lf any truckers or airlines gave us trouble. . . paulie had the union people scare them with a strike. it was beautifui. lt was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and jimmy was in charge of it all. whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. to us, it was better than citibank. you got a phone? come on ! two niggers just stole my truck. can you believe that shit? there was jimmy. . . and tommy and me. and there was anthony stabile. how're you doing? frankie carbone. and then there was mo biack's brother, fat andy. and his guys, frankie the wop. freddy no nose. and then there was pete the kiiier, who was sally balls' brother. then you had nickey eyes. . . and mikey franzese. that guy, i wanna see him. jimmy two times, who got that nickname because he said everything twice. i'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers. what is this? coats? henry, i need suits, not coats. suits are coming thursday. but it's the middle of summer. what'll i do with fur coats? you don't want furs? i'll take them away. no, i want them. we'll hang them in the freezer with the meat. how's that? for us, to live any other way was nuts. to us, those goody- good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks. . . and took the subway to work every day and worried about biiis, were dead. they were suckers. they had no balls. lf we wanted something, we just took it. lf anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad they never complained again. lt was just all routine. you didn't even think about it. frankie, what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469? i can't believe this guy. 520 ain't even close to 469. what's that got to do with anything? piece of cake. it's all there. don't worry about the alarms. i just gotta find a way to get the key. no problem, right? i'll take care of it. tell him what you were telling me. too good to be true. big score coming from air france. bags of money coming in. tourists and american servicemen change their money. . . into french money and send it back here. calm down. it's beautiful. it's totally untraceable. okay? the only problem is getting a key, but i've got a plan. me and frenchy and this citizen. yeah, he's a piece of work. if i'm right, there could be $500,000 coming in, all cash. the best time is probably over a weekend. so maybe saturday night. there's a jewish holiday on monday. they won't find out until tuesday. beautiful. what about the security? security? you're looking at it. it's a joke. i'm the midnight- to- eight man. i'm the commandant. he just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage. it's beautiful. it won't be a problem at all. good. we're on. what's really funny is that fucking bank job in secaucus. i'm in the middle of the weeds, lying down. he says, "what are you doing?" i said, "i'm resting." "here? this ain't no beach or park." i said, "i'm resting." i know i'm resting. he pulls me in, starts asking questions. you know, this and that. "what are you going to tell us?" i said, "my usual. nothing." "why tell you?" the fuck. he says, "no, you'll tell me something today." i said, "okay, go fuck your mother." you saw the paper, anthony. my head was out like this. now i'm coming around, and who do i see in front of me?

if there was something i could do, i would. i would like to help you out. sonny, tell him what we talked about. you think it's all right? yeah. maybe you could come in with me, take a piece of this joint. it'd be good. what are you talking about? you mean the restaurant? it's a classy place. look at the layout. you've been in there a million times. you know how it looks. tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig. i don't mean no disrespect, but that's the way it is. i know you're his friend. i'm begging you. what can i say? what am i gonna do? what do you want from me? i don't know anything about the restaurant business. nothing. all i know is to sit down and order a meal, not how to make a restaurant. not for you. it's just a place to hang. the chef is great. the shows are good. there's a lot of whores coming in. i'd love to help you, but what do you want from me? what'll i do? tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed. what am i supposed to do? shoot him? that wouldn't be a bad idea. i'm sorry i said that. i didn't mean it. i just mean that he's scaring me. i just need help. help me, please. you know anything about this restaurant business? he knows everything. he's there 24 hours a day. another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool. that's how often he's in there. you want me to be your partner? is that what you're telling me? what the fuck you think i'm talking about? paulie, please. come on. it's not even fair. you don't understand. you run the joint. maybe i'll try to help you, all right. god bless you, paulie. i appreciate it. you've always been fair with me. now the guy's got paulie as a partner. any problems, he goes to paulie. trouble with a bill, he can go to paulie. trouble with the cops, deliveries, tommy. . . he can caii pauiie. now the guy's gotta come up with paulie's money every week. . . no matter what. "business is bad? fuck you, pay me. had a fire? fuck you, pay me. "the place got hit by lightning? fuck you, pay me." can i get one of those tvs? also, paulie could do anything. especially run up bills on the joint's credit. and why not? nobody's gonna pay for it anyway. when deiiveries are made at the front door. . . you move the stuff out the back and seii it at a discount. you take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $1 00. lt doesn't matter. lt's all profit. then finally, when there's nothing left. . . fucking shame. . . .when you can't borrow another buck or buy another case of booze. . . you bust the joint out. you light a match. do you need help reaching anything? you look like you're decorating a christmas tree. you don't know what you're doing. she's from the five towns. who? the jew broad, diane, i was telling you i'm going to shag. i've been trying to bang her for a fucking month now. she won't go out with me alone. no. no, what?

did you have enough to eat? it was delicious. i'm just watching my diet. let me watch your figure. l couldn't wait to get away. l was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. when they were having coffee, l was asking for a check. i had business. have some coffee. it'll wake you up. can we have the check? what are you doing? i got to go. we just got here. i got that thing. i gotta go. wait a couple of minutes. we'll leave together. this way we don't go out like a bunch of hobos, one at a time. i couidn't stand him. l thought he was really obnoxious. he kept fidgeting around. you don't mind, do you? that's very annoying. good? you might prefer manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table. ready? henry, lighten up. we just got here. what are you doing? before it was time to go home, he was pushing me into the car. . . then pulling me out. lt was ridiculous. diane and tommy made us promise. . . to meet them again on friday night. we agreed. of course, when friday night came around, henry stood me up. i feel terrible. i don't know where he is. he really liked you, too. all he did was talk about her. we were a trio instead of a double date that night. he would have called. i hope it's nothing serious. but l made tommy take me looking for him. tommy, what the fuck? you got some nerve standing me up. nobody does that to me. who do you think you are, frankie valli or some kind of big shot? slow down, i forgot. i thought it was next week. it was this friday and you agreed, so you're a liar! we can talk about this. take it easy. talk about it? talk to you after what you just did to me? forget it. i thought you would stand me up. you looked bored. you didn't say anything. what do you expect? let me make it up to you. i'll think about it. l remember, she was screaming on the street, and i mean ioud. but she looked good. i'll think about it. but it'll cost you, hill. a lot. she had these great eyes just like liz taylor's. at least that's what l thought. hello, henry. you're ready?

you're leaving your car? he watches the car for me. it's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting. it's a lot quicker that way, you know what i mean? i like going in this way. it's better than waiting in line. how are you doing? what's up? here you go. how are you doing? i'm doing all right. good. every time i come here, every time, you two. don't you work? henry, nice to see you. hi, how are you? anthony, right in the front. anything you need, just let me know. tony, thanks a lot. i appreciate it. how are you guys doing?

vinnie would kill him. if i don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard, then vinnie will be there for life. you think you got problems. what about jeannie's kid? he was in an argument. a $1 0 card game. he pulls out a gun. the gun goes off. some kid gets killed. when the grandmother hears it. . . and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot. now jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor. jeannie drinks. maybe she's depressed. give me a break. she's drunk. as soon as something happens, you make them out to be saints. they had bad skin and wore too much makeup. they didn't look very good. they looked beat- up. and the stuff they wore. . . was thrown together and cheap. a lot of pantsuits and double- knits. she spends her life in a nightgown. the woman is no angel, believe me. they talked about their rotten kids. . . and about beating them with broom handies and beits. and that the kids still didn't pay any attention. when henry picked me up, l was dizzy. i don't know if i could live like that. god forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison? karen. mickey said that jeannie's husband- - do you know why jeannie's husband went to the can? because of jeannie. he wanted to get away from her. let me tell you something. nobody goes to jail unless they want to. unless they make themselves get caught. they don't have things organized. i know what i'm doing. i've got things organized with these guys. you know who goes to jail? nigger stickup men. know why they get caught? because they fall asleep in the getaway car, karen. come on, don't worry so much, sweetie. come here. after a while, it got to be all normal. none of it seemed iike crime. lt was more like henry was enterprising. . . and that he and the guys made bucks hustling while other guys. . . were sitting on their asses waiting for handouts. our husbands weren't brain surgeons, they were blue- collar guys. the only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut corners. where's the strong box, you varmint? don't fucking move! don't move. see you at the diner. i'm riding shotgun. did you see him give it right over? back to the hideout to split up the loot. we were all so very close. there were never any outsiders around. absolutely never. being together all the time made everything seem all the more normal. hello, mrs. hill. police. i'm detective deacy. this is detective silvestri. we have a search warrant. would you read and sign it? anywhere? yeah, anywhere. this'll take a while, we have to go through everything. you boys want some coffee? no coffee now, thanks. be careful. we'll just go about our business. there was always a little harassment. they wanted to talk to henry about this or that. they'd make me sign their subpoenas or warrants. but mostly they just wanted a handout. a few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found. l always asked if they wanted coffee. some wives, like mickey conway. . . used to curse at them and spit on the floor. she used to spit on her own floor. that never made any sense to me. lt was better to be polite and call the lawyer. we always did everything together, and we always were in the same crowd. anniversaries, christenings. we only went to each other's houses. the women played cards. when kids were born, mickey and jimmy were the first at the hospital. when we went to the isiands or vegas for vacation. . . we went together. no outsiders ever. lt got to be normal. lt got to where l was proud that i had the kind of husband. . . who was willing to risk his neck just to get us the little extras. but i got mom to watch the babies tomorrow night. can't do it, karen. why not? i just can't. i got something lined up. but tomorrow's the only night she can do it. pretty please? i can't. what do you want me to do? i got to go. wait a minute. i wanted to go shopping. can i get some money? how much do you need? how much? that much. this much. give me a kiss. see you later. all right. welcome home, batts. hi, how are you? sit down. have a drink. give them all a drink. and give those irish hoodlums a drink. there's only one irishman here. it's a celebration, fellas. top of the morning to you. it's good to be home. this is my friend jimmy. henry. it's his joint. this is lisa. tommy. all dressed up. all grown up and doing the town. look at this. forgot you were having a party for this mug. come here. i'll say hello. billy, how are you?

i said no more shines. you've been away a long time. they didn't tell you. i don't shine shoes anymore. relax. what's got into you? i'm breaking your balls a little, that's all. i'm only kidding with you. sometimes you don't sound like it. there's a lot of people around. i'm only kidding. we're having a party. i haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh. i'm sorry, i didn't mean to offend you. i'm sorry, too. it's okay. no problem. now go home and get your fucking shine box. motherfucking mutt! you fucking piece of shit! come on, come on ! he bought his fucking button ! that fake old tough guy! you bought your fucking button ! don't get nervous. you motherfucker! keep that motherfucker here! keep him here. come on, you fucking feel strong?

it's all right. we're hugging and kissing over here and then he acts like a fucking jerk. you insulted him a little bit. you got a little out of order. i didn't. you insulted him a little. i didn't insult anybody. give us a drink. okay. let's have some drinks. drinks on the house. no, have the drink with me. the drinks are on the house. i fucked kids like that in the can. in the ass. fucking break up my party. you've been away for six years. it's different now. i did my fucking time, jimmy. i came home and i want what i got to get. i got mouths to feed. you're gonna get it. you understand? get the door! let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth ! let's shoot him. fucking mutt dented my shoes. his whole crew is going to be looking for him. this is bad. what do we do with him? we can't just dump him on the street. i know a place upstate. they'll never find him. more tablecloths. i didn't want to get blood on your floor. go open your trunk. we'll get a shovel at my mother's house. she has a shovel here somewhere. quiet, i don't want to wake her up. look who's here. what did you do? what happened? i hit something on the road. jimmy will tell you. what happened to him? i haven't seen you in so long. what happened to him? you, too. how are you? why are you up so late? he came in. you came in. i'm so happy to see him. go inside. make yourselves comfortable. i'll make you something to eat. go to sleep. we're leaving. i can't. not while he's home. i haven't seen him in so long. i want to see him. you go inside. this stuff is like lead. tell me, where you been? i haven't seen you. you haven't called. where have you been? i been working nights. and? and tonight we were out late. we took a ride out to the country and hit a deer. that's where all the blood is from. jimmy told you. it reminds me, i need this knife. i'm taking this, okay? okay. just for a while. the poor thing. we hit the deer and his paw. . . . what do you call it? the paw. the hoof. got caught in the grill. i got to hack it off. ma, it's a sin to leave it there. i'll bring the knife back. delicious. thank you. why don't you get yourself a nice girl? i do, almost every night. but get yourself a girl so you could settle down. i do, every night. then i'm free. i love you, i want to be with you. settle down. how's your friend henry? what's the matter? you don't talk much. talk. what are you quiet for? you don't eat much, you don't talk much. i'm just listening. something wrong? when we were kids, the compares used to visit one another. there was this man. he would never talk. he'd just sit there all night, not a word. they say to him, "what's the matter? don't you say anything?" he says, "what am i going to say, that my wife two- times me?" so she says, "shut up! you're always talking." but in italian, it sounds much nicer. cornuto contento. that's it. what does that mean? it means he's content to be a jerk. he doesn't care who knows it. did tommy tell you about my painting? no. look at this. it's beautiful. i like it. one dog goes one way and the other goes the other. one's facing east, the other west. so what? he's saying, "what do you want from me?" the guy's got nice white hair. beautiful. the dog looks the same. looks like somebody we know. without the beard. it's him. it's him. what the fuck is that? for most of the guys, killings were accepted. murder was the only way everybody stayed in line. you got out of line, you got whacked. everybody knew the rules. sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked. hits became a habit. guys would get into arguments over nothing. before you knew it, one was dead. they were shooting each other aii the time. shooting people was a normal thing. lt was no big deal. we had a serious problem with billy batts. this was really a touchy thing. tommy killed a made guy. batts was part of the gambino crew and was considered untouchabie. before you touched a made guy, you had to have a good reason. you had to have a sit- down and you'd better get an okay. . . or you'd be the one who got whacked. saturday night was for wives. . . but friday night at the copa was for the girlfriends. last week, we saw sammy davis, jr. you got to see this show. what a performer. he does these impersonations. you'd think it was the real people. it's unbelievable. you could see how a white girl could fall for him. what? not me. but you could see how some girls could. like that swedish girl. so you condone that stuff. take it easy. i don't want to be kissing nat king cole over here. no, i'm not talking about me. but, you know, he's got personality. personality? he's talented. i understand what you're saying. but watch what you say. people get the wrong impression. i just said he was talented, you're unbelievable. just leave it alone now, i understand what you said. he's talented. leave it at that. no? not even uncle paulie? what did you hear about that thing? the brooklyn thing? no, the guy from downtown. the guy from where christie lived? no. the guy who disappeared, the one they made the beef on. know the guy i mean? yeah. his name was batts. his people are driving everyone crazy looking for him. nobody knows what happened to him. he came into the joint that night and then just disappeared. that was it. all right. keep your eyes open. they're busting my balls over it. all right? yeah. okay, everybody, let's eat. i want my money. he owes it. you know that thing we took care of upstate? paulie was talking about that. got to get it out of there. they just sold the property to make condominiums. it's been six months. we got to get it out of there right away. henry, hurry up. my mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us. here's an arm. very funny, guys. here's a leg. here's a wing. what do you like, the leg or the wing?

i'll sing with an italian accent. i couid see for the first time that jimmy was a nervous wreck. his mind was going in eight different directions at once. think morrie tells his wife everything? morrie? him? that's when i knew jimmy was going to whack morrie. that's how it happens. that's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked. he's a nut job. he talks to everybody. acts like a jerk in his commercials. nobody listens to what he says. nobody fucking cares what he says, he talks so much. make sure you bring him here tonight. okay? all right. start like this. sorry. did i get you in the eye? stop breaking my balls, all right? l was just stalling for time. i knew i stiii had tiii 8:00 or 9:00 to talk jimmy out of killing morrie. but meanwhile, as far as jimmy knew, l was going along with the program. i pulled his hair out of his fucking head. i bit him. he's out cold. i'm enraged. i wanted to kill this little fuck. i walk away. we start to go in the fucking joint. i don't want to turn around. jimmy's going like this to me. i don't want to fucking turn around. i don't want to turn around. he picks up his fucking head, he says. . . . i said, "don't say it." "jerkoff!" what are you going to do? what? i fucking fly at him. i got him and i'm banging his head, banging his fucking face. i'm pulling his hair out of his head. i beat him to a pulp. to a pulp i beat him. he's laying there full of fucking blood. i'm out of breath. forget about tonight. forget about it. lt was a load off my mind. poor bastard. he never knew how ciose he'd come to getting killed. even if i toid him, he wouid have never beiieved me. jimmy, could i talk to you now? you're a pisser. a real pisser. want to talk now? okay, let's talk. let's get it over with. i've never met a ball buster like you, my whole life. who loves you more than i do? i'd do anything for you. except to stop busting my balls. let's go have coffee. want to go to the diner? we'll go to the diner on the boulevard. which diner? rockaway boulevard. it's open 24 hours. they got danishes? they got everything. let's pick up some danishes for belle. hear about the points we were shaving up in boston? it's terrific. nunzio- - i thought he'd never shut up. what a pain in the ass. what'll we do with him? chop him up and get rid of the car. call me when you're through. frank, let's chop him up. all right. where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you? you said chop him up. at charlie's, not here! where are you gonna chop him here? come on, what are you doing? get out of here. i got a better shot letting him drive. the car's cold. get the fuck out of here! what, warm it up? get out of here! who is it? it's belle. open up. it's belle. let me in. morris didn't come home. he's missing. i know something's happened. calm down. he's missing ! i know something happened. he's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere. in 27 years, he's never been away all night without calling. i know something's happened. i know you know. let me get changed. i'll take you home, then look for him. i've been home! i've been on the phone- - he's playing cards. what'll i tell belle? who gives a fuck? tell her he ran off with some broad. what do you care? watch this. don't fuck with them. i do it all the time. i'll bust their balls. don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks. come on, fuckos. let's go for a ride. keep them up all night. i'll see you later. jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery. . . but it had nothing to do with me. l gave jimmy the tip and he gave me some christmas money. from then on, l kept my mouth shut. l knew jimmy. he had the cash. lt was his. he kicked some money upstairs to paulie, but that was it. lt made him sick to turn the money over to the guys who stole it. he'd rather whack them. anyway, what did l care? l wasn't asking for anything. and jimmy was making nice money through my pittsburgh connections. still, months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over. when they found carbone in the meat truck. . . he was frozen so stiff. . . it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy. still, l never saw jimmy so happy. he was like a kid. we had money coming in through my pittsburgh people. . . and even after a whiie, the lufthansa thing began to calm down. what made jimmy so happy that morning. . . was that this was the day that tommy was being made. jimmy was so excited, you'd think he was being made. he must have made four caiis to tommy's house. they had a signal set up, so he'd know the minute the ceremony was over. ma, where are you? here i am. you're home. home? i'm leaving. you look lovely. i look good, huh? you look wonderful. be careful. congratulations. i love you. don't paint any more religious pictures, please. god be with you. bye, ma. we always called each other goodfellas. you'd say to somebody: "you'll like this guy. he's all right. he's a goodfella, one of us." you understand? we were goodfellas. wiseguys. but jimmy and l could never be made because we had irish biood. lt didn't matter my mother was sicilian. to become a member of a crew, you've got to be 1 00% ltalian. . . so they can trace your relatives back to the old country. lt's the highest honor they can give you. lt means you belong to a family and a crew. lt means nobody can fuck around with you. lt also means you could fuck around with anybody. . . just as long as they aren't also a member. it's iike a iicense to steai. a license to do anything. how many years ago since you were made? i'm an old- timer. 30 years ago. thirty years? brings back a lot of memories. pike's peak was a pimple then, wasn't it? as far as jimmy was concerned, with tommy being made. . . it was like we were all being made. we wouid now have one of our own as a member. who's this? this is vinnie. vinnie. what happened? did we get straightened out? no, we had a problem. we tried to do everything we could. what do you mean? you know what l mean. he's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it. that's it. what do you mean? he's gone. that's it. i knew it! i can't fucking believe it. what happened? they fucking whacked him. fuck. are you all right? lt was revenge for billy batts. . . and a lot of other things. and that's that. there was nothing we could do about it. batts was a made man and tommy wasn't. we had to sit stiii and take it. lt was among the ltalians. lt was real greaseball shit. they even shot tommy in the face. . . so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral. l was gonna be busy all day. l had to drop off some guns at jimmy's. . . to match some siiencers he had. l had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him home. l had to pick up some new pittsburgh stuff for lois. . . to fly down to some customers i had near atianta. right away, l knew he didn't want them, and l'd be stuck for the money. l only bought them because he wanted them, and now he didn't. what good are these? none of them fit. what's the matter with you? i'm not paying for it. l didn't say a thing. jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye. stop the drugs. they're making your mind into mush ! you hear me? i'll take them back. my pittsburgh guys always wanted guns. since l would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery. . . l was pretty sure l'd get my money back. oh, my god. when l finally got to the hospital, michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed. jesus christ, what happened to you? i almost got into an accident on the way here. and l told him l was partying all night. i'm fine. come on. get over here. doc, i'm fine. let me check you out. come on. he took mercy on me, gave me 1 0 milligrams of valium. . . and sent me home. my plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up karen. there it is. you see that helicopter right there? right in front of us, there. i think it's been following me all morning. get the fuck out. what are you, nuts? i'm telling you. i don't know what's going on. it's the third time i've seen it. at the hospital i saw it. i had to make some stops. i've seen it every time. i've been all over town and i've seen it all day. l was cooking dinner that night. l had to start braising the beef and veai shanks for the tomato sauce. it was michaei's favorite. l was making ziti with meat gravy. . . and l'm planning to roast some peppers over the fiames. . . put on some string beans with olive oil. i had some beautifui cutiets. . . that were cut just right. . . that l was going to fry up as an appetizer. so, l was home for about an hour. my plan was to start the dinner early. . . so karen and l could unload the guns jimmy didn't want. . . then get the package for lois. . . to take to atlanta for her trip later that night. l kept looking out the window, and l saw that the helicopter was gone. michael, keep an eye on the sauce. stay here with your uncle michael. so l asked my brother to watch the sauce, and karen and i started out. oh, god. i see it. i see it. look, it's right there. damn ! that's it. there it is. we got to get to your mother's. see, i told you. it's funny. it's not the end of the world. we're going to your mother's. go inside, tell your mother not to touch anything outside the house. nothing. we couldn't go to your mother's house? you had to come here. let's go shopping. i'm not nuts, it's been following me all morning. i'm telling you. fine. fine. he thinks i'm paranoid ! i should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid i am. come on, let's go inside. yeah, it's gone. i don't hear anything. let's go back to your mother's. they all right? beautiful. they're great. didn't i tell you, you were paranoid? didn't i tell him? yeah. i need a hit. want to see helicopters? come on, i'll show you helicopters. i've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you. l had to get home and get the package ready for lois to take on her trip. also, l had to get to sandy's to give the package a whack with quinine. plus, l knew sandy would get on my ass. l had the cooking to finish, and l had to get lois ready for her trip. it's sandy. what is this? she's a pain in the ass. when are you coming over? in an hour. you staying tonight, right? i can't. i got my brother tonight. come on, stop. we'll talk about it later, okay? goodbye. hello? lt's me. you ready? tell michael not to let the sauce stick. keep stirring it. henry says don't let the sauce stick. i'm stirring it. listen, you know what to do? yeah, yeah. don't "yeah, yeah" me, lois. this is important. make sure you leave the house when you make the call. understand me? call from an outside line. i mean it. jesus, you must think i'm dumb. why are you bugging me? i know what to do. you little hick, just make sure you do it. you can be such a pain. hey! just do it! okay. un- fucking- believable. all of them. every fucking girl in my life. what did he say? nothing. what does she do after she hangs up with me? after everything l told her? after all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit? she picks up the phone and caiis from the house. lf anybody was listening, they'd know everything. they'd know a package was leaving my house. . . and they'd even have the time and flight number, thanks to her. as soon as l got home, l started cooking. l had a few hours until lois' flight. l told my brother to watch the stove. all day long the guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce. l had to drive over to sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy. do you think you can come over here, fuck me, and leave? come on. you got someplace better to go? don't talk like that. come on. you all right? yeah, sure. you believe me? do you believe me? that the last one? yeah. you lying son of a bitch. i hate you ! please stop feeding the dog from the table. . . from the plate on top of it. stop it. i have to. you don't have to. i got to go home. what do you mean, you got to go home? i've been carrying this all day. we got to start taping it to your leg. we got to go soon. i got to go home and get my hat. forget your fucking hat. are you kidding me? so i need a trip to rockaway because you want your hat? i need it, i got to have it. it's my lucky hat. i never fly without it. lois, do you understand what we are involved in here? i don't care. i need my hat. i won't fly without it. what couid i do if she insisted l drive her home for her goddamn hat? l hid the package in the kitchen and went to take her home. a hat? what the fuck is this? police! freeze! don't you move, you motherfucker. . . or i'll blow your brains out. shut the car off slowly. for a second, l thought l was dead. but when i heard aii the noise, l knew they were cops. only cops talk that way. don't fucking move. lf they had been wiseguys, l wouldn't have heard a thing. i wouid have been dead. michael, lock the door! talk to me. when was the last time you took a collar? fuckhead, i'm talking to you. you don't want to say a fucking word, don't. i don't really give a fuck. you'll do 25 years. see how much of a good guy you'll be then. all day l thought the guys in the helicopter. . . were local cops busting my balls over lufthansa. they turned out to be narcs. just get the lawyer. they'd been on me a month. phone taps, surveillance, everything. you know the boys. all the pals are here. you don't want to talk to me, you'll have a problem all night. each one of these counts holds 25- to- life in new york state. twenty- five fucking years, pal. i'll slap your fucking head inside out. what, were you guys grocery shopping? are we going to make a cake? you going to make a fucking cake? you got anything good in there? is it good? bye- bye, dickhead. see you in attica, dick. i spoke to jimmy. he offered to give me some money. he just wants to know what's happening. he just wants to talk to you. fuck jimmy and his money. i got to straighten out everything with paulie or i'm dead. then you're better off staying in here. they could whack me in here as easy as outside, maybe even easier. they're afraid i'll rat them out. people are already walking away from me. i'm dead in here. you got to get me out. karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and l was out. l remember l had this feeling l would be killed right outside the jail. l knew paulie was still pissed at me, and he's such a hothead. and l was worried about jimmy. see, jimmy knew if paulie found out he was into drug deals with me. . . paulie would have jimmy whacked even before me. this is the bad time. l didn't feel safe until l got home. now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope. . . the cops never found, then disappear until l can get things straightened out. fuck! where's the stuff i left, karen? i flushed it down the toilet. you what? what was i supposed to do? they were all over the house. that was worth $60,000! i need that money! that's all we got! what was i supposed to do? they had a search warrant! that's all the money we had ! i was depending on that! why did you do that? i had to. they were going to find it! they would have never found it! they would have, i swear to you ! they would've found it! why did you do that? they would have found it. why did you do that, karen? oh, my god ! i had to do it. oh, my god. paulie, l'm really sorry. i don't know what else to say. i know i fucked up. yeah, you fucked up. but i'm all right now. i can be trusted now. i'm clean. on my kids, i'm clean. you looked in my eyes and lied to me. you treated me like a fucking jerk. like i was never nothing to you. after what you said, i couldn't come to you. you know, i was ashamed. i'm ashamed now. but i got nowhere else to go, paulie. you're all i've got. and i really need your help. i really do. take this. and now i've got to turn my back on you. $3,200. that's what he gave me. $3,200 for a lifetime. lt wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin. we got to get out. i don't want to run. i don't want to. am i supposed to pick up and leave everything? go hiding? i don't want to do that. is that what you want? if we stay around here, we're dead. you got it? we're dead. they're right. you took too much of that stuff. you're totally paranoid. how's he doing? busting his balls or what? he's okay. they sobered him up. good. very good. glad to hear it. you know what kind of questions they're asking him? jimmy, i don't know. i got my mind on so many other things. i got no money. . . . the girls are old enough to read the newspapers. tell him he's got to call me. okay? as soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. it's important. he doesn't know i came here to see you. it's like he's crazy. take this. it's a couple of thousands. thanks, jimmy. don't worry, everything will be all right. i got some beautiful dior dresses. you want to have them? pick out a few for yourself. for my mom. yeah, whatever. no. it's over here. in the store on the corner. it's swag, so i got it down on the corner. go ahead, sweetheart, i'll see you. thanks, jimmy. don't worry. i'll try. don't forget, he's got to call me. over here? right down there. it's over there, on the corner. right there. no, go ahead. it's right in there. no, jimmy. i'm in a hurry! my mom's watching the kids! i got to get home! i'll come back later! karen ! what happened? nothing. what happened? i just got scared. got the keys? what happened, karen? i just got scared. it's okay. are you all right? yeah. lf you're part of a crew, nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you. lt doesn't happen that way. there aren't any arguments or curses iike in the movies. your murderers come with smiies. they come as your friends. people who cared for you all your life. they always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help. so l met jimmy in a crowded place we both knew. l got there 1 5 minutes early, and jimmy was already there. he took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up. he wanted to make sure i wasn't taiied. he was jumpy. he hadn't touched a thing. on the surface, everything was supposed to be fine. we were supposed to be discussing my case. but l had a feeling jimmy was trying to sense if l'd rat on him to save my neck. i been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the phone. now you understand? it's going to be okay. you got a good chance to beat the case. you know that kid from the city we were talking about? you know? the kid turned out to be a rat. as soon as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody. i know where he is. he's hiding now. know what i'm saying? would you have a problem going with anthony to take care of that? no, not at all. that way they got nothing. jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before. but now he's asking me to go to florida and do a hit with anthony. that's when i knew i wouid never have come back from fiorida aiive. whenever you move me, i asked once and i'll tell you again. . . i don't want to go any place cold. you don't have a choice in that matter. come on. whoever fucking controls it. . . just no place cold. do that for me. i'm trying to- - he's bronchial, that's why. if he's legitimately bronchial, we'll consider that. i'd like to go someplace not cold. can i ask you some questions? what about my parents? what about them? am i going to see them? am i going to talk to them? don't i have some kind of contact with them? no. wait a minute. wait a minute. you mean to tell me that. . . god forbid something happens to my parents, they get sick, i can't see them? maybe something can be worked out if they're sick. . . if there's extraordinary circumstances- - i can't do this. i can't do this, henry. i can't leave my parents. excuse me, karen, i told you before. i'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me. i can't do it without you. so, you do whatever, but. . .that's it. you need henry, not me, right? that's right. frankly, i don't care whether you go or not. if it'll make him a better witness, i'd like you to be with him. they want henry, not me. henry'll be in the protection program. they can't get to him. they can only get to him by getting to you or your kids. if he goes into the program, you're in danger- - i don't know anything. don't give me. . . the babe- in- the- woods routine. i've listened to those wiretaps, and i've heard you talk about cocaine. conversation after conversation you talked to henry on the phone. it doesn't matter. whether he goes to jail. . . or stays on the streets and beats the case, he's a dead man. he knows it and you know it. what about the kids and school? will they get left back? l mean, what goes on? go to wall street and get real crooks. whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor. what it comes down to is we're your only salvation. we'll save your life and his life, and we'll keep you out of jail. this morning you told the jury about your background. lt was easy for us to disappear. my house was in my mother- in- law's name. my cars were registered to my wife. my social security cards and driver's licenses were phonies. l never voted or paid taxes. my birth certificate and arrest sheet was all you'd ever have to know l was alive. do you see him here in this courtroom? yes. will you please point him out for the jury? let the record reflect that mr. hill identified the defendant, james conway. do you also know a man named paul cicero? do you see him in the courtroom? yes. can you point him out for the jury? let the record reflect that mr. hill identified the defendant, paul cicero. your honor, i have a document. . . . the hardest thing was leaving the life. i stiii iove the iife. we were treated iike movie stars with muscie. we had it all, just for the asking. our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along. l had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen. l had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed. people call them rats because rats do anything to survive. isn't that right? objection ! objection sustained. i know nothing about being a rat. you know everything about it. objection, your honor. in view of the violence. . . . anything l wanted was a phone call away. free cars. keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city. l'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend... then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies. it didn't matter. it didn't mean anything. when i was broke i would go out and rob some more. we ran everything. we paid off cops. we paid off lawyers. we paid off judges. everybody had their hands out. everything was for the taking. and now it's all over. that's the hardest part. today everything is different. there's no action. l have to wait around like everyone else. can't even get decent food. after l got here l ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce. . . and l got egg noodles and ketchup. l'm an average nobody. l get to live the rest of my life iike a schnook.
