i'm saying i handle responsibilities like a man. when you're in the nba and you roll into a city... ...there's a hundred girls waiting down at that lobby. listen to me. and there's 20 more that make it past security onto your floor. and the boldest one is right there at your front door. and after a while, man, it just becomes part of the game. i'm sorry i lied to you and i shouldn't have. but i only did it because i didn't wanna see that look on your face that you got right now. well, since we're being so honest... since we're being so honest, i... i figured that i'd tell you i'd decided to drop out of school and turn pro. oh, boy. damn it! look, man, i know you're mad at me, okay? but i cannot let you do this. i always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary. reggie: yeah. oh, yeah. hey, what's up? downtown. hey, what's up, girl? where's your boy? in the back. reggie: oh, man. man: yeah. hey. hey, baby. you weren't at my game. i'm sorry. i had this meeting with this guy. you win?

yeah. can we talk? talk to your new girlfriend. look, i took the ho to burger king. cheap date. at least she had time for me. so you messed around to prove a point? what'd i just say? got your head so far up your ass, it took a cheap date for you to notice me. heh. what, q man? did i forget to kiss your ass like everybody else? you forgot to be there. that night you wanted to talk about your dad, i had curfew. what was i supposed to do? stay. if i stayed, i wouldn't be starting. at least you got your priorities straight. i'd never asked you to choose. i never have to. i'm a ballplayer. if anybody knows what that means, it should be you. if basketball is all you care about, why are you boning me? why don't you bone dick vitale? wait a minute. hold on. how do i know the next time you're feeling neglected or whatever... ...you're not going to just run around on me? if we're gonna be together. i have to be able to trust you. i'm not asking for us to be together. what? i'm going through a lot of shit right now. it's obviously more than you got time for. heh. how are you gonna tell me what i have time for? i mean, whatever i did, we can fix this. i don't think so. you don't think so? look, i'm entering the draft. you're what? i'm going pro. who knows where i'm gonna end up, you know? when did you decide all this? a few days ago. so that's it? just... just forget about you and me?

i wouldn't know. what? you mean you've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped nothing? they're just not my type, i guess. shit. them italian boys, they love them some black women. they can't get enough of me. mm-hm. heh. do you ever think about going back? sometimes. but what's the alternative? not playing? you remember big toni? mm-hm. she quit last year and now she works at some bookstore. i mean, look at us. they treat us like hollywood stars over here. we just played in a championship game. it doesn't get much sweeter than this. on tv] chick: they've made seven straight points in this run. worthy for three. announcer: james worthy. chick: this game is in the refrigerator. the door is closed, the lights are out. the eggs are cooling, butter getting hard and the jell-o jiggling. and here come the subs. you know, it's nice to see the subs gets a chance to play and the fans love it. chick: they really do. announcer: and quincy mccall is in for nick van exel. chick: quincy's got the ball over in the corner. puts up a three-pointer. that's no good. the former trojan came out after his freshman year. as they get out the floor the other way, i can tell you that he has moved around quite a bit. but now he's trying to find a home with these lakers. quincy makes a steal. he's on his way. open court. look out, folks. it's showtime. medic: don't move. nona? how is he? not great. what is that, "not great"? he tore his acl. almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. how you been? happy. and he won't wanna see you. hey, son. you made sportscenter. what do you want? just came by to check on you. after five years? i don't remember that being all my fault. seems like you divorced me the same time as your mom. look, i know things look kind of bleak right now. but don't get down on yourself. i stopped taking your advice a long time ago. or did you forget? you want me to step off, man? yeah. fine. but not until i say something. you're a better ballplayer than i ever was. but that ain't the only thing you got going for you. you're smart, quincy. i always knew that you could do anything you wanted to. you wanna play ball, son? well, then play ball. just know that you're not like everybody else on that goddamn court. you ain't like i was. you got options, quincy. that's all i ever wanted to show you. how come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me? i just couldn't, son. good morning. and i thought this was gonna be awkward. monica. uh... i got these. not that you need any more. so how are you doing? i'm, uh... i'm doing all right. i heard you were in spain. i was. hmm. i see your peach fuzz finally grew in. just something new i'm trying. no, it looks good. i mean, it's cool. thank you. shouldn't you be lying down and...? no, no, i'm cool. uh... you can have a seat. no, no, i'm fine. i'm fine. still trying to be the first girl in the nba, huh? yeah, well, i tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical. that's funny. i never did. oh. kiss my ass. i can't believe it's been five years. i tried calling you a couple of times. oh, yeah? yeah. i wanted to give you props on making first team all-american. and then, you know, when magic retired, i tried again. must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. it was always messing up. i figured something like that. so when you going back? actually... ...i'm not. what do you mean? i'm tired of playing overseas. i mean, i'm over there by myself... ...no family, no friends. my phone bill is ridiculous. thinking about giving it a rest for a while. a rest? yeah. i mean, basketball just isn't fun for me anymore, you know? no. quincy. hey, girl. baby. nobody would switch flights with me. don't worry about it baby, what are you doing out of bed? what are you doing? okay, okay. take it slow. oh. let me help you. that's my baby. ah. hello. hi. baby, this is monica. kyra: monica. you guys grew up together, right? quincy's told me all about you. monica, this is... this is kyra, my fiance. fiance. wow. wow, heh. congratulations. thank you. i didn't know. wow. that's great. that's... well, uh, heh, i should go. monica, i really appreciate you coming by. yeah. we really appreciate it. yeah. quincy, good luck with your knee and everything. kyra: bye. bye. hey. hi. your sister's bringing the baby by later, so be nice to be around. yeah. i can't wait to see her. need any help? no, i can manage. thank you. i just saw quincy. how's he? engaged. to that stewardess? yeah. you met her? ugh. his mother had a barbecue a few weeks back. he could do a lot better, if you ask me. so, what do i do? find out where they're registered and send them a gift. whatever. is that still your answer to everything? yeah, when you come at me with bullshit like that. oh, no. are they cursing their mamas in spain? you didn't want my opinion, i don't know why you asked. i asked, but why does it always have to be so damn prissy? what do you want me to say, monica? go over there and beat up the girl? go have sex with him? because i'm not gonna do it. yes, i think decorum is important... ...and, yes, i'd rather bake a pie than shoot a stupid jump-up shot. if that makes me too prissy for you, then that's just too damn bad. so that's why we can't get along? because i'd rather shoot a stupid jump shot? you're the one who always turn your nose up at me. no, i don't. oh, yes. female superstar athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife. that's not it. don't tell me you're not ashamed of me... ...because i know. i remember when i was 8 years old. you spent, like, four hours cooking up this big, fancy meal... ...and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed... ...because in he walks with a couple of pizzas... ...and you didn't say anything. you never stood up for yourself. ever. if i was ashamed, it was because of that. that is ridiculous. what's ridiculous is not being a caterer... ...so your husband can feel like a man... ...knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers. damn it. oh, monica. i'm sorry. is that really all you think about me? when your daddy and i got married, yes, i had dreams. but i happen to have gotten pregnant with lena... ...and then i had you... ...so i had to put my dreams on hold. you know what day i remember? in high school... ...your spring dance... ...and i put my mother's pearls around your neck... ...and i told you, you were beautiful... ...because you were. that day, i was happy i didn't have a catering business to run off to. my family had three meals a day. they had somebody to pick up after them... ...and when my daughters went to a dance... ...i could help them get ready. that is what i came to care about. that's all you cared about. i must have played in a thousand games... ...and i can only remember you being at two. you had your coaches and your daddy for that stuff. you know it never mattered to you one way or another whether i was at them games. it mattered, mama. it mattered. -seven pulls up the original account. shift f8 pulls up the corporate account. you can see the information there. you could get... oh, hello, mr. wright. could you excuse me? sure. thank you. how's it going? fine. fine? yeah. no, no, no. quincy: no? why? no. damn, girl. i remember your mom had to beat you into a dress. heh. very funny. visiting? kyra's out of town for a couple of days. figured i'd keep my mom company. so how's the knee? it's getting there. strong enough to get you down the aisle? two weeks. heh. i didn't get to send you an invitation but, you know, you're more than welcome. it's okay. i'm probably, you know... can i ask you something? you never told me why ball wasn't fun anymore. it just isn't. because i'm kind of feeling that way too. you had a rough couple of years. that's all. i haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. i miss some of the attention, but besides that... you're serious. seems like i needed ball when i was trying to be like my pop. now, it's just trying to be better than my pop. now it's time to try something different. like what? i'm thinking about going back to school. wow. wow. yeah. kyra hasn't heard about the school thing yet. heh. she'll probably say it's the painkillers talking. it's a trip, you know? when you're a kid, you see the life you want... ...and it never crosses your mind it's not gonna turn out that way. so why did you give up ball? why do you keep sweating me on that? because i don't get it. man, i never knew a girl, i never knew anyone... ...who loved ball as much as you. now you're gonna trade in your nikes for a pair of shoes you can't even walk in. what's up? just leave it alone, all right? all right. camille: you need to put a sweater on. it's a little chilly, sweetie. she's fine, ma. yes, your little icicle arms are so sweet. all right, ma. lena: come on, lorena. your grandma says it's too cold. oh, "grandma"? then camille scoffs] you know, monica... ...one of the things that always drove me crazy about you... ...and i have to admit, it made me jealous... ...what i always admired was the fight in you. what are you talking about? well, i might be a little more prissy in the situation than you... ...but remember when i said i thought quincy could do better? i was talking about you. what's going on? we need to talk. please? you asked me what was missing. what? from basketball. you woke me up to tell me that? it's not fun for me anymore... ...because you're missing. what i'm trying to say is... ...i've loved you since i was 11. and the shit won't go away. we haven't talked since college. and you wait two weeks before my wedding to tell me something like that. heh. i know. i probably should have said it two weeks ago. you haven't changed. you still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. guess what, it doesn't. then why are you so upset? you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. better late than never, right? wrong. i'll play you. what? one game. one-on-one. for what? your heart. you're out of your mind. so, what, you're gonna bitch up? huh. what's that supposed to be, some psychology? look, i know why you broke up with me in college. and not that it wasn't messed up, but i should've been there for you. i just didn't know how to do that and be all about ball. monica... ...after that stuff with my dad... ...i couldn't trust anybody, okay? i was lost. that was five years ago. i've moved on. prove it. what will this prove? you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to. so? so if i win... ...it's because deep down, you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. and deep down, you want me to stop you. and what happens when you lose? if i lose... ...i'll buy you a wedding present. first to 10. five. scared? i got better things to do. check. one-zip. check. why don't you d up this time? two-zip. three-zip. where's the d? sleepy? your knee hurt? come to play? so now you wanna play. now you're taking off your brace, huh? you think that's gonna make you play better? check. two. three. three up. i don't hear you talking. i don't hear you. come on. come on. quincy: aah! point. all's fair in love and basketball, right?
