yup. well, not just me. you're starting to make me a little nervous. why am i starting to make you nervous? because i'm starting to think you might be too good of a person for me. no, i'm not that good of a person. you're sneaking off every day to do manual labor on a house for charity. on your spring break. yeah, you're right. it's selfish, really, me being this generous. you don't drink, you don't smoke. nope. nope. you probably don't sleep around. absolutely not. okay, look, you gotta have a fault. i do. okay, care to enlighten me? i curse. no. i do. no, you don't. i do. i haven't heard you. well, that's because it's in my mind. there's a never-ending stream of curse words... ...that i'm thinking at all times. okay, fine, just say one then. no, i can't tell you because it's filthy. right. yeah. okay, all right. fair enough. no, i have faults, john. trust me, i have plenty of them. you'll see. i hope so. we have to be finished with this in three weeks. hope that actually happens. these are to be the bedrooms, parents' room... ...the boys' rooms, two boys, 7 and 9. living room and the bathroom. and then this is the kitchen. this is the best room because the mom's a really good cook. we're gonna make it really beautiful with white tile floors and tiles... ...on the counter tops and there's gonna be a roof. here, john, come here. a roof would definitely be good. it's gonna be like this, but it's gonna be everywhere. it's the only cover we have. nice, we're gonna be here for a while. where'd you get your scar? that one? a knife fight. it was five years ago, we were really drunk and the guy went for my eye. that's terrible. why? he missed. the way people act around you, the way they treated you at that restaurant. it's like they're scared of you. they're not scared of me. they might be scared of who i used to be. and who is that? somebody different? so when did you change? when you went into the army? yeah. yeah, i mean, partly yeah. and the other part? i don't know, i'm still working on that. so you used to be tough. and maybe you still are a little bit. you don't scare me, john. no? well, you scare me. don't worry about him. john! what, you think you're safe in there? okay. no! it's all right. everybody understands. what are you doing over here? you're missing the party. the party's just managing fine without me. what's wrong? why are you all the way over here by yourself? i'm dying, john. what? that's not even funny. i'm gonna miss you. it's almost over. no, it's not almost over. yes, it is. i leave tomorrow. i have to go back to school. so? and you. no, and me nothing. my commitment's up in 12 months. and then i'm back. for good. a lot could happen in 12 months, john. you don't think i know that? i know that. and i'm not afraid at all. i promise you... ...that it'll all be over sooner than you think. then i'll be back for good. you promise? i promise. i'm probably gonna be out of the army way before you're out of school. am i gonna be in the audience when you graduate? i think i might take a little longer to graduate. been spending so much time around your dad... ...and i think now i want to teach special education. you don't say. i don't know why it's taken me... ...so long to realize. i mean, i've lived next to alan my whole life.. i'm sorry, back up. what does that have to do with my dad? well, there's.... i mean, there's an explanation for why he is the way he is. forget it. never mind. no, no, no. no, let's go. come here. what? so, just, what were you saying? i grew up next to a kid with autism. i have a frame of reference. whoa, autistic? you saying my dad's like alan? you're saying my dad's retarded? no, alan's not retarded, john. he's autistic. there are milder forms of it and these things go undiagnosed. is this what you've been doing? you've just been studying my dad? no. how could you even say that? i've lived with my dad my entire life. put up with him my entire life. you think i don't know that he's not normal? yeah? you think i need you to tell me he's not normal?

i might just make this a career. no talking you out of this, huh? mark, on my mark! mark! where you thinking next? oh, man. i don't know, wherever they send us. actually, we're sending you home to the states, john. i'm sorry, we just got the news. he's conscious, but he's not lucid. and he's hardly ever responsive. it's hard for me to say how severe the stroke really is... ...because we don't know how long he was down before they found him. if i'd have been there to find him like that earlier... ...do you think it would've made a difference? i doubt it. i really doubt it. hey, jeff, here's that scan. no problem. hey, pop. what--? what the heck do you--? ma'am, why do you have him out here? you okay? how you feeling? i.... i mean, it's nothing, but i wrote you-- i wrote you a letter. no, no, don't read it now. you don't have to-- i didn't think you'd-- why don't you read it when i'm not around? you know what? the hell with it. i'll just read it to you. "dear dad. there's something i've been wanting to tell you. you remember a few years back... ...when i got shot. well, you wanna know the very first thing... ...that entered my mind at that moment? right before i blacked out? coins. suddenly i was 8 years old again. i was on that tour of the u.s. mint. i was listening to the guide explain how coins are made. how they're punched out of sheet metal and how they're rimmed and beveled. how they're stamped and cleaned. and how each and every batch of coins are personally examined... ...in case any have slipped through with the slightest imperfection. do you remember that, dad? i mean, do you remember that trip to philadelphia we took? that's what popped into my head. i'm a coin of the united states army. and i was minted in the year 1980. i've been punched from sheet metal. i've been stamped and cleaned. and my edges have been rimmed and beveled. but now i have two small holes in me. so i'm no longer in perfect condition." how about it, dad? you know, we're just a couple of culls here, huh? "but there's one-- there's one more thing... ...that l want to tell you too. after l got shot, you know, right before i blacked out. you wanna know the very last thing i thought of?" i'm sorry. the very last thing i thought of.... you wanna know the very last thing i thought of? i'm so sorry, i don't want to rush you... ...but we have another service coming in. john. what brings you home? it's my dad. how's your dad? he.... i'm sorry. i wish i had known. it's okay. it wouldn't have made any difference. i'm so sorry. he's-- he was a really good man. you finally did it, huh? camp horse sense. no. i didn't. i tried. it only lasted one summer after we took over this place from my parents. it was.... it was expensive. do you want to come inside? it's just me. when do you have to go back? as soon as i get my dad's stuff squared away. have you settled down yet? no. but you must be dating a lot, huh? no. i don't think you can call it dating exactly. it's so good to see you. here. alive. hold on. i'm just gonna-- i'm sorry. hello? hey. no, i'm fine. i.... well, john-- john is here. yeah, john tyree. yeah, i'm gonna leave soon. okay, i'll see you. i'll be there in like 20 minutes, okay? i love you too. bye. he wants to see you. wait, what? it's tim? initially after he was diagnosed, he was so optimistic. he wasn't concerned, all he cared about was alan... ...which was inspiring. it wasn't until after the cancer spread to stage four that i noticed a big change. what kind of cancer is it? lymphoma. he's had it with being cooped up in that room... ...so he basically just spends all his time out here. sometimes with alan. can i have a crumble cake? alan, do you remember john? hello, john. hey, alan. he's gotten big. how are you? good. i'm gonna get him a crumble cake. oh, that's a good idea. he's been talking about that. come on, alan. i guess you must want to kick my ass, huh? there's not a lot i can do about it here, is there? it's all part of my master plan. hell of a plan. i love her. everything that happened in my life before, it's gone now. it's been wiped clean. i wanted to tell you that. and i'm sorry. i'm sorry for how it happened with you so far away. but l know now that alan will always have someone to take care of him. he will always be in good hands. she still loves you, you know. why is it black? it's plain as day, you can see it all over her face. i wish that weren't the case... ...but she's never looked at me the way she used to look at you. you should know that. be careful, alan. he still loves those horses, huh? yeah, he'll be out there till bedtime. i gotta get him out of that hospital. he needs to come home. there's a company in texas with an experimental drug. that might help. but the insurance companies don't pay for it, of course. my parents sold their beach house a year ago. which was a godsend. we've done a few fund raisers. but l never would have guessed that we would run out so fast. stay for dinner, okay? so you drink now. just a glass or two at dinner. tim got me started a couple years ago. why are you looking at me like that? what do you mean? how am i looking at you? differently. i don't know, how do you want me to look at you? you're different. i don't know-- i don't know why i came here. i mean, what are we doing? we're sitting here and we're eating and we're talking... ...but no one's actually saying anything. what do you want me to say? what do you want to talk about? why didn't you call? why didn't you call me? i mean, did i not deserve any more explanation than... ...that letter? you couldn't have called me? you couldn't have given me some sort of chance to change your mind? don't you think you owed me that? i couldn't. you couldn't? you thought that little of me that you couldn't have just called me. why? because i couldn't. give me an answer. why? why not? because i couldn't. an answer. because just hearing your voice, i would have changed my mind. is that what you wanna hear, john? what you came all this way to hear? you think it was tough out there? think it was easy for me without you? you thought that every single day it wasn't... ...a goddamn marathon of my life without you? tim was sick. he was sick and he needed me. he needed me to help him. he needed me to help him with alan, with everything. i was alone and i had no idea what i was doing. i didn't plan this. i didn't know that it was gonna happen to me. but it did. you don't think i've tried--? i picked up the phone a thousand times to try to call you. you think that i really wanna be standing here in front of you like this? i had no choice. i know. i saved every single one of them. you've been so many places. i think the yellow envelopes are from africa or something. really? i even have your first, your very first letter to me. tim's water bill. sorry. it's okay. hope you have more where that came from. i'm gonna put a pot of coffee on. i should go. i'll see you soon, then? say it back. when i say it, you say it. remember? john? just say it. goodbye, savannah. i don't think you remember me. but i believe you knew my father, bill tyree. oh, yeah, of course i did. i haven't seen him in a while, though. how is he? he recently passed. i'm sorry. i think you might've offered to buy his coin collection one time. ls that right? sure did. more than once. just out of curiosity, how much do you think a collection like his is worth? a collection that big? i don't know, i'd have to see it. look, i only got about one condition. all the mules, they gotta stay together. you can sell them as a set or keep them for yourself. they have to stay together. you're really going to sell me all his coins? yes, sir. all but one. this comes up nickel, we're gonna set up right here. we got shade. it comes up penny, we'll be up on the ridge. we got visibility. that'd be penny side. all right, let's go to the ridge. sergeant. thank you.
