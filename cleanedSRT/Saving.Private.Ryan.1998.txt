"dear mr. brian boyd, no doubt by now you have received full information..." "dear mrs. jensen..." "...about the untimely death of your son." "...no words of mine can ever relieve the grief..." felt his loss tremendously." "he was a fine soldier, and he believed very strongly in..." "it's no secret anymore... that we were involved in one of the most important operations of this war." who held us all together. he was always the first to volunteer and the last..." a clearing near a road where over 4,000 troops had passed." served in a combat unit whose dangerous duty is to place itself beyond..." cherish and hold so dear. the loss of lee and others like him is a distinct blow to the regiment." understand your desire to learn as much as possible regarding the circumstances leading to his death." colonel, i've got something you should know about. yes? these 2 men died in normandy. this one at omaha beach. "sean ryan." this man at utah. "peter ryan." this man was killed last week in new guinea. "daniel... ryan." the 3 men are brothers, sir. i've just learned that this afternoon their mother's going to be getting all 3 telegrams. that's not all. there's a fourth brother, the youngest. he parachuted in with the 101st airborne night before the invasion. he's somewhere in normandy. we don't know where. is he alive? we don't know. come with me. goddamn it. all 4 of them were in the same company in the 29th division, but we split them up after the sullivan brothers died on the juneau. well, any, uh, contact with the fourth son, james? no, sir. he was dropped about 15 miles inland near neuville. but that's still deep behind german lines. now, mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped. first reports out of lke's people at shaef said the 101st is scattered all to hell and gone. there's misdrops all over normandy. assuming private ryan even survived the jump, he could be anywhere. in fact, he's probably k.i.a. and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flat-hatting through swarms of german reinforcements all along our axis of advance, they're gonna be k.i.a. too. i have a letter here... written a long time ago to a mrs. bixby in boston. so bear with me. "dear madam, i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you... are the mother of 5... sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... that would attempt to beguile you from the grief... of a loss so overwhelming. but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save. i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost... and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom. yours very sincerely and respectfully... "abraham lincoln." that boy is alive. we are gonna send somebody to find him... and we are gonna get him the hell out of there. yes, sir. yes, sir. we expected 32 tanks on the beach. 27 didn't make it. miller, charlie company. go on in, captain. i understand your situation, but if we don't off-load those shermans by 0600, we're gonna have an entire division stuck at carentan with its pants around its ankles. well, you let me know. have charlie company hold at vierville until we can get some armor up there. yes, sir. runner! airborne was supposed to win an open door for the rest of us. instead they misdropped, scattered all their sticks into the wind. what's your situation? uh, yes, sir. sector 4 is secure. we, uh... we took out towed 88s here, here... and here. they'd already gotten 4 of our shermans and a number of our deuce-and-a-halves. these 2 minefields are actually one big one. we tried to make our way up through the middle of it, but it turned into a mixed, high-density field-- little bit of everything. sprengmine 44s, schumine 42s, pot mines, a-200s-- the little wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up. this road here... they placed big mushrooms-- teller mine 43s, i guess for our tanks-- from here right up to the edge of the village, right here. so we marked 'em, called the engineers. resistance? we had higher support expectations, sir. there was an understrength company without artillery. wehrmacht 346 infantry, von luck kampfgruppe. we ended up with 23 prisoners. we turned them over to m.p.s from the 29th. what about our casualties? well... the figures... were 35 dead... times 2 wounded. they just... didn't wanna give up those 88s. it was a tough assignment. that's why you got it. yes, sir. john... i've got another one for you. yes, sir. this one's straight from the top. i wish. you and i are taking a squad over to neuville on a public relations mission. you leading a squad? some private in the 101st lost 3 brothers, and he's got a ticket home. how come neuville? they think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops. it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war. like finding a needle in a stack of needles. but what about the company? we take the pick of the litter, and the rest get folded into baker. jesus christ. they took away your company? it wasn't my company, it was the army's. so they told me, anyway. give me reiben on b.a.r., jackson, wade, beasley and caparzo. beasley's dead. all right. mellish then. we got anybody speaks french? not that i know of. what about talbot? this morning. oh. all right. i'm gonna go try to dig up another interpreter. assemble at battalion motor pool on the beach. yes, sir. what are we gonna do? listen up-- what? what we gonna do? you're going home wrapped in an american flag with a hunk of cheese in your ass, caparzo. i thought you liked it in the ass. what? attention! as you were. i'm looking for corporal upham... timothy e. i'm upham, sir. i understand you speak french and german. yes, sir. how's your accent? just a slight one in french, but my german's clean. a touch of bavarian, sir. very good. you've been reassigned to me. grab your gear. we're going to a place called neuville. yes, sir. when was this updated? updated as of 0830 this morning. uh, sir... this is the 12th s.s. panzer. these are the 2 axis that advance south. sir, there are germans in neuville. that's what i understand, corporal. um, sir, there are a lot of germans in neuville. you have a problem with that, corporal? no, sir. just if you consider i've never been in combat. i make maps, and i translate. i need someone who speaks french and german. yes, sir. my 2 guys were killed. it's just that i haven't held a weapon since basic training, sir. did you fire the weapon in basic training? yes, sir. well, then get your gear. yes, sir. sir, may i br-- may i bring my typewriter, sir? yes, sir. thank you very much, sir. that a souvenir? uh, no, sir. take your time, corporal. you should look on the bright side of things, corporal. yes, sir. for one thing... you don't need to carry those. you'll need that. need this. yes, sir. don't need that. hey. oh. hey. you want your head blown off, you fancy little fuck? don't you ever fuckin' touch me with those little rat claws again. get the fuck back in formation. i was wondering where you're from, that's-- caparzo, is it? hey, drop dead, corporal. got you. and another thing, every time you salute the captain, you make him a target for the germans. do us a favor. don't do it. especially when i'm standing next to him, capisci? uh, capisci. corporal, what's your book about? hey, watch your rifle. sorry. it's supposed to be about the bonds of brotherhood that develop between soldiers during war. brotherhood? what do you know about brotherhood? get a load of this guy, fish. why don't you ask the captain where he's from? yeah, ask the captain. he'll tell you everything you wanna know about him. you wanna explain the math of this to me? i mean, where's the sense of risking the lives of the 8 of us to save one guy? 20 degrees. anybody wanna answer that? reiben, think about the poor bastard's mother. hey, doc, i got a mother, all right? i mean, you got a mother, sarge has got a mother. i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother. well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers. "theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die." la la la la la la la la what the fuck is that supposed to mean, huh? we're all supposed to die, is that it? upham's talking about our duty as soldiers. yes, sir. we all have orders, and we have to follow 'em. that supersedes everything, including your mothers. yes, sir. thank you, sir. even if you think the mission's fubar, sir? especially if you think the mission's fubar. what's "fubar"? oh, it's german. yeah. never heard of that. sir... i have an opinion on this matter. well, by all means, share it with the squad. well, from my way of thinking, sir, this entire mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. yeah. go on. well, it seems to me, sir, that god gave me a special gift, made me a fine instrument of warfare. reiben, pay attention. now, this is the way to gripe. continue, jackson. well, what i mean by that, sir, is if you was to put me and this sniper rifle anywhere up to and including 1 mile of adolf hitler with a clear line of sight, sir-- pack your bags, fellas. war's over. amen. oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin. hey, so, captain, what about you? i mean, you don't gripe at all? i don't gripe to you, reiben. i'm a captain. there's a chain of command. gripes go up, not down. always up. you gripe to me, i gripe to my superior officer, so on, so on and so on. i don't gripe to you. i don't gripe in front of you. you should know that as a ranger. i'm sorry, sir, but, uh... let's say you weren't a captain, or maybe i was a major. what would you say then? well, in that case, i'd say this is an excellent mission, sir, with an extremely valuable objective, sir, worthy of my best efforts, sir. moreover... i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and am willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men, especially you, reiben, to ease her suffering. he's good. i love him. right. les americaines! les voila! lis arrivent! lis viennent nous sauver! viens par ici! thunder! flash! upham, over there. reiben, you four go. go, go, go, go, go. you guys are a sight for sore eyes. sergeant hill, our relief showed up. how many are you? just 8 of us. we're not your relief. sorry. what do you mean, sir? we're here for a private ryan. who? ryan? what for? is he here? i don't know. maybe with a mixed unit on the other side of town. uh-huh. it's hard to get to. the germans punched a hole in our center, cut us right in 2. what's his name again? ryan. james ryan. he dropped in with 101st. goldman, get me a runner up here. runner! come on. jonesy, make a hole up there! we got stopped by some intense rifle action from the eastward. the germans have been reinforcing 2 regiments all day. the streets have been quiet for about 45 minutes. most of the german fire now is concentrated to the west. who's that on the loudspeaker? that's dagwood dusseldorf, our friendly neighborhood morale officer. the statue of liberty is kaputt.

how was the road in? we lost most of our ammo. one of our men. lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka to the right side of the road. yes, sir! and get ryan up here. ryan, front and center! here comes our boy. told you he was an asshole. sir, private ryan reporting as ordered. at ease. captain miller, 2nd rangers. he wants a word with you. this way. all right. take a knee. private, i'm afraid i have some bad news for you. well, there isn't any real easy way to say this, so, uh... so i'll just say it. your brothers are dead. we have, uh, orders to come get you... 'cause you're going home. oh, my god, my brothers are dead. i was gonna take 'em fishing when we got home. i'm so sorry, james. i can't tell you how much. how-- how did they die? they were killed in action. no, that can't be. they're both-- that... that can't be. my brothers are still in grammar school. you're james ryan? yeah. james francis ryan from lowa? james frederick ryan, minnesota. well, does that-- does that mean my brothers are ok? yeah, i'm sure they're fine. are you sure that they're ok though? we're looking for a different private ryan. this is just a big foul-up. how do you know? how can you be sure? how do you know the foul-up isn't that his brothers are ok and that-- lieutenant. i'm sorry for the trouble. i just wrote them a letter before i left. i got to get home. i got to get home right now. i want to go home. shh, take it easy. so where in the hell is our ryan? i don't know. are you in touch with your c.o.? that figures. what unit's your ryan in? baker company, 5-0-6. the guy with the broken foot, he's 5-0-6, right? yeah. charlie, i think. you think? yeah. ryan? don't know-- man! your drop zone? just inside of vierville. vierville? how the hell did you end up way up here? you got me, sir. c-47 took heavy fire. pilot went crazy trying to get out of there, turning every which way, took more fire in the drop, got messy. i ended up here. i haven't seen a single guy from my stick, sir. god knows where they are. anybody from baker company have a big mouth? say where the drop zone might've been? no, sir, but i know baker company had the same rally point as us. show me. my men are beat. we're gonna hold up here for about 3 hours. we'll pull out after dark. got anything left in this town like a 3-star hotel, something with clean sheets and soft pillows and room service? how about a nice comfy church? we'll take that. what have you heard? how's it all falling together? well, we got the beachhead secure. problem is monty's taking his time moving on caen. we can't pull out till he's ready. so-- that guy's overrated. no argument here. you got to take caen, so you can take saint-lo. you got to take saint-lo to take valognes. valognes, you got cherbourg. and cherbourg, you got paris. paris, you get berlin. and then that big boat home. we sure as hell could use you around here, but i understand what you're doing. you do? yeah. i got a couple of brothers myself. oh. good luck. thank you. no, i mean it. find him. get him home. what's with your hand? i don't know. it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for embarkation. it comes and goes. well, you may have to get yourself a new line of work. this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore. what? what? nothing. what was the name of that kid at anzio? the one that was always walking around on his hands, you know, and he was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze? vecchio. vecchio. yeah. yeah, vecchio. he was a goofy kid. i remember he used to pee a "v" on everybody's jacket for vecchio. for victory. vecchio. he was so short. he was a midget, wasn't he? "how did you get to be a ranger?" he got shot in the foot once, didn't he? and he was walking on his hands. yeah, well, he could walk faster on his hands. he could run faster on his hands than... vecchio. yeah. caparzo. you see, when... when you end up killing one of your men, you see, you tell yourself it happened so you could save the lives of 2 or 3 or 10 others. maybe a hundred others. do you know how many men i've lost under my command? how many? 94. but that means i've saved the lives of 10 times that many, doesn't it? maybe even 20, right? 20 times as many? and that's how simple it is. that's how you... that's how you rationalize making the choice between the mission and the men. except this time, this mission is a man. this ryan better be worth it. he'd better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer-lasting lightbulb or something. 'cause the truth is, i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo. amen. look. there it goes again. sir... are you all right? now, look, we're gonna move out in 2 hours. why don't you get some sleep? how he does it. falls asleep like that. i mean, look at him. the guy's lights out the minute his head hits the pack. clear conscience. yeah, what's that saying? "if god's on our side, who the hell could be on theirs?" "if god be for us, who could be against us?" yeah, what did i say? the trick to falling asleep is trying to stay awake. how is that, wade? mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day. so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home. so what i used to do, i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake as long as i could, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep. yeah, well, that wouldn't have mattered none in my house. my ma, she would've come home, shook me awake, chatted me up till dawn. i swear, that woman was never too tired to talk. yeah, that's probably the only time she could get a word in. funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early, and i'd pretend to be asleep. your-- your mom? yeah. she'd stand in the doorway looking at me. and i would just keep my eyes shut. and i knew she just wanted to find out about my day, that she came home early... just to talk to me. and i still wouldn't move. i'd still pretend to just be asleep. i don't know why i did that. we only got a couple hours. shut up and go to sleep. captain? corporal? how you doin' there? you all right? yeah, i think this is all good for me, sir. really? how is that? "war educates the senses, calls into action the will, perfects the physical constitution, brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man." yeah, well, i guess that's emerson's way of... finding the bright side. you know emerson, sir? i know some. so where are you from, captain? what'd you do before the war? what's the pool up to? you know, i think it's around 300, sir. well, when it gets up to 500, i'll give you the answers and we'll split the money. how about that? well, if that's the way you feel, sir, i feel it's my duty under your command to suggest that we wait until it gets up to a thousand, sir. what if we don't live that long? 500? 500 would be good, yeah. yes, sir. yeah. get some sleep, corporal. yes, sir. who's got sulfa powder? my buddy's bleeding! he needs a tourniquet! wade. see what you can do. yes, sir. hold on, fellas. it won't be much longer. how we doing here? all right. yeah, doing all right. don't worry about it. doc's in town. it's all right. don't worry, fellas. the 29th infantry's breaking through. they'll be here soon. anybody got plasma? captain. hey, captain. soldier, you want to fill me in? uh, yeah. lieutenant dewindt, sir. 99th troop carrier squadron carrying in 327th glider infantry. this one was mine, sir. i was the pilot. 22 men dead. i ended up over there without a scratch. it took my copilot's head right off. well, where's the unit? who are these people? well, the guys we came in with, sir, they headed off first night. haven't seen them since. meantime, other guys keep showing up, 1, 2, half-dozen at a time. then some officer'll come along and patch together a mixed unit, head off to make trouble, sir. we're looking for a private james ryan. he was in baker company 5-0-6 of the 101st. no, you got me, sir. a lot of guys come in and out of here. upham. yes, sir? check out that squad. see if ryan's in it. yes, sir. reiben. smell that leg right there. find out if it's south of cheese. phew. juden. juden. keep moving! juden. i'm juden, you know? ju-den. yeah, i couldn't pry him out of there hard as i tried. i'd need a winch. yep, brigadier general amend, deputy commander, 101st. some fucking genius had the great idea of welding a couple of steel plates onto our deck to keep the general safe from ground fire. unfortunately, they forgot to tell me about it until we were just getting airborne. well, that's like trying to fly a freight train. ok? gross overload. trim characteristics all shot to hell. i nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level. and when-- and when we released, you know, i cut as hard as i could, tried to gain some altitude and still keep her from stalling. we came down like a fucking meteor. and this is how we ended up. and the others, they stopped easy enough ok, though, you know? we were just-- we were just too damn heavy, you know? the grass was wet. downward slope and all. 22 guys dead. all that for a general? one man. lot of that going around. fubar. fubar. fubar. fubar. y'all got that right. i looked up "fubar" in the german dictionary. there's no "fubar" in there. upham. yes, sir? there's more paratroops out there. find out if one of them's ryan. yes, sir. oh, you might want to check these out, sir. dog tags. more than i really want to count, sir. i've-- i've covered a lot of bodies, sir. start going through those. yes, sir. i'll help. what do you think, jackson? do you think that little prick's in there? well, if he is, i'm gonna find him. i bet that son of a bitch is. this guy's still alive. says i nail him first. let's see who we got in here. you mugs don't stand a chance. all right, you think this little shit bird's in here or what? just keep looking. all right. gary lanico. ben rubino. mike cessacchio. i swear, all the guineas are buying it, huh? not the right name. wee willie winkie, that's a buddy of yours. we gotta find this prick. where is this son of a bitch? don't mix them up, jackson, all right? keep them in your own fucking pile. how am i supposed to know who we got? why don't you just shut up, reiben, all right? everybody be friends. cranky there, huh? i think i got a winner. what are you talking about? ryan. ryan? take a look at that, mellish. you know what? you're a genius. you really are. r-i-e-n-n-e. that's rienne. and that's french, all right? you know what that means? it's means nothing. what beats 3 of a kind? i got shit here. i got all guys from new york. a hand with that? i got a full house. straight flush. you were looking at my tags. you're cheating. you know? ryan. this guy. do you need a hand with that? can you read that shit? jesus christ, look at this poor bastard, huh? not bulletproof, huh? all right? he's got between his ears. what you fellas got between your legs. we got to give him that. not bad for you, jackson. i got 3 of a kind. full house. the whole goddamn airborne's watching. these aren't poker chips. all right, all right. put 'em back in there! he's not here. maybe we should bust up into a couple of different groups, huh? and wander the woods like hansel and gretel, calling his name. he's bound to hear us sooner or later. ryan! that might be a little hard to do, captain. maybe the locals have seen him. hey, you know-- uh, excusez-moi. parlez-vous ryan, james ryan? merci. merci beaucoup. ryan! anybody know ryan, 101st airborne? ryan? you know a guy named ryan? private james ryan from lowa? anybody know a ryan? james ryan?! hey, joe, doesn't, uh, michaelson pal around with a ryan from "c" company? yeah, i think so. well, bring him up here, would you? you know private ryan? you're gonna have to speak up, sir. you're gonna have to speak up, sir! my hearing is not so good! it comes and goes! a german grenade went off right by my head! got it, got it. do you know private ryan? who? private ryan? james ryan? jimmy ryan? james. james francis ryan. no, no, no. james francis ryan. get me a pencil. something to write on. quick! quick! come on, a pencil! here you are. a small one, sir. write this down. james francis ryan, question mark. iowa, question mark. do you know him? does he know him? read the message. look. yeah. of course i know him, sir. does he know where he is? yeah, yeah. by about 20 miles, ended up way over by bumville or some damn place. him, me, and a couple of other guys were coming here to the rally point, ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to, uh... ramelle... ramelle. to baby-sit a bridge. that's the last i've seen of him, sir. great! great! thank-- thank you. read and thank you. you're welcome! assemble on me. thank you, lieutenant. ramelle. we're here. there. ramelle... is on the merderet river right here, just to the southwest of us. you know anything about this bridge he was talking about, captain? yep. the target has always been cherbourg. we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port, and rommel knows that. so he's gonna try to get his armor across the merderet river anywhere he can. that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg. that makes any village on that river with an intact bridge solid gold real estate. let's go. what the hell is that? it's got to be out of action. well, it looks like we got something in that... sandbag bunker right under the station. see it? yeah. that's my guess, too. what is it? machine gun. probably mg-42. jesus. is that what got those guys? maybe one of them's our boy. patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good. i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here. so, captain, what i'm trying to say is, why don't we just go around the thing? i hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it. i'm with reiben on this one, sir. i mean, we left them 88s. for the air force. the air force isn't gonna spend ordinance on one machine gun. we can still skip it and accomplish our mission. i mean, this isn't our mission, right, sir? oh, that's what you want to do, mellish? you just want to leave it here so they can ambush the next company that comes along? no, sir, that's not what i'm saying. i'm simply saying, it seems like an unnecessary risk given our objective, sir. our objective is to win the war. sir, i just, uh, i don't have a good feeling about this one. well, when was the last time you felt good about anything? all right, 3 runners with suppressing fire. mellish, you hook to the right. i'll go up the middle. who's going left? who's going left? i'll do it. i'll go left. all right. upham, switch off with jackson, and you linger in the rear. we advance and keep pressure on him till he has to change out his barrels. i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range. maybe i should go up the middle, sir. the way you run? i don't think so. maybe i should go left, sir. maybe you should shut up. reiben, base of fire. mags and clips where you can reach 'em and... and extra grenades for the base runners. 4 down and dead! and get up here! we need water and extra dressing now! get the morphine out of the extra medical kit! get the morphine out of the extra medical kit! son of a bitch. get some sulfa on there. move my legs up. more sulfa, mellish. listen to my voice. you're gonna be all right, doc. wade, you're fine. you're going on a hospital ship. put my legs up. i got 'em, i got 'em, i got 'em, i got 'em. gonna be ok, wade. upham, give me your canteen! come on, come on, come on, come on. pressure on it. you're gonna be ok. some morphine. how's it look? it's all right. how's it look? you're gonna be ok. here comes the morphine. am i shot in the spine? you're ok, wade. am i shot in the spine? easy, easy, easy. pressure on him. easy, easy. lift him up. it's ok, doc. it's all right. wade, you got an exit wound. it's in the small of your back. how big-- how big's the hole in the-- it's about the size of an acorn. you're fine. pressure on it. put some pressure on it. put some pressure on it. it's all right. pressure on it! is there anything bleeding worse than the others? yeah, right here. do you know what it is? no. right here. i'm gonna put your hand on it. pressure on her. right there. ok? that's the one. oh, my god, my liver! oh, my god, it's my liver! tell us what to do. tell us how to fix you. what can we do? tell us what to do. i could use-- i could use a little more morphine. more morphine, sir? ok. ok. give it to him. give it to him. i don't wanna die. here you go. wade. here you go. here it comes. shh. there you-- give him another one. mama? mama? i want to go home, i want to go home. mama! mama! mam-- mama, mama, mama, mama, mam-- aah! reiben, hold him! unh! bitte! totet mich nicht! ich will mich ergeben! vater unser im himmel, geheiligt werde den name, dein reich komme... not yet. first make him mark and cover wade's body for grave detail. same thing for those paratroopers down there. strip that stuff off him. check him for intelligence. ask this piece of shit if he's the one who shot wade. ask him! it doesn't matter. it does matter! warst du am maschinengewehr? nein. ich hab nachgeladen, ich hab nicht geschossen. shut up with that filthy pig latin. sprichst du deutsch? jackson, you're hit. shut up. i guess it just skinned the arm, sir. cleaned and dressed. you and sarge watch the perimeter. bitte, totet mich nicht. bitte, totet mich nicht. ich will mich ergeben. he says please don't shoot. i don't care what he says, upham. sir? sir, you're gonna let them kill him? this is not right, sir. you can help him with the bodies. what is happening? this is bullshit. i like american. steamboat willie. toot, toot. steamboat willie. yeah, steamboat willie. american. ich bin noch nicht fertig! ich muss hier noch viel tiefer graben! ist noch lange nicht tief genug! he's says he's not finished. that's what you think. come on. nein! yeah. nein! ich bin noch nicht fertig! please... i like america. fancy schmancy! what a cinch! go fly a kite! cat got your tongue! cool beans! betty boop! what a dish! betty grable. nice gams. i say can you see i say can you see l-- i say... fuck hitler. fuck hitler. tut mir leid um den mann, den ihr verloren habt. den sanitater. es ist halt krieg, nicht? sir, he says he's sorry about wade. he says he's sorry about wade, sir. captain! captain, this isn't right! you know this. he's a prisoner. he surrendered. he surrendered, sir! tell him... to march a thousand paces in that direction. then he can take off the blindfold. we'll be gone, and he turns himself in to the first allied patrol he comes across. you gotta be kidding. we're letting him go? he's a p.o.w., reiben. can't take him with us. our guys'll pick him up sooner or later. only if he doesn't get picked up by his own wehrmacht first, then thrown back into circulation. captain, you just let the enemy go. this is such bullshit. y'all got that right. bullshit? this is bullshit? shooting a prisoner, that'd be ok? it's against the goddamn rules! the goddamn rules just walked off with your new friend. but i guess that was the decent thing to do, huh, captain? get your gear. let's go. gear up. the captain just gave you an order. yeah. like the one he gave to take this machine gun. that was a real doozy, wasn't it, sarge? soldier, you are way outta line. yes, sir, that was one hell of a call, coming to take this nest, but, what the hell, we only lost one of our guys going for it. i hope mama ryan's real fuckin' happy knowing that little jimmy's life is more important than 2 of our guys! then again, we haven't found him yet, have we? huh?! get the hell off me! reiben, get up. gear up. fall in. i'm done with this mission. hey! hey! don't you walk away from your captain. reiben, get back in line. i'll spend the rest of my life in the stockade if i have to, but i'm done with this. i'm not gonna ask you again, soldier. captain! this is bullshit! fall in! you gonna shoot me over ryan? no, i'm gonna shoot you 'cause i don't like you. sir! if he wants to go, just let him go! are you letting this happen? captain! you see this? captain? sir? sir, ryan's dead. bullshit! sir, we have a situation. i have a sixth sense about these things. i know it in my bones. you don't kill that son of a bitch kraut. now you're gonna shoot me? he's better than you. then why don't you just do it, sarge? do it, man. put one in my leg-- i'm gonna shoot you in your big goddamn mouth! well, put your money where your mouth is-- you don't know when to shut up. you don't know how to shut up. captain, please! what's the pool on me up to? what? you are a coward son of a bitch! i'm waiting, sarge. mike, what's the pool on me up to right now? what-- what's it up to? what is it, $300? is that it, 300? i'm a schoolteacher. i teach english composition in this little town called addley, pennsylvania. the last 11 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school. i was the coach of the baseball team in the springtime. i'll be doggone. back home, when i'd tell people what i do for a living, they'd think, "well, that figures." but over here, it's a... a big... a big mystery. so i guess i've changed some. sometimes i wonder if i've changed so much, my wife is even going to recognize me whenever it is i get back to her. and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today. ah, ryan... i don't know anything about ryan. i don't care. the man means nothing to me. he's just a name. but if... you know, if going to ramelle and... finding him so he can go home, if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, well then... then that's my mission. you want to leave? you want to go off and fight the war? all right. all right, i won't stop you. i'll even put in the paperwork. i just know that every man i kill, the farther away from home i feel. by memories of days gone by in my solitude you taunt me with memories that never die i sit in my chair filled with despair there's no one could be so sad with gloom everywhere i sit and i stare... half-track! cover! who's doing the shooting? who's doing the shooting? aah! get ready to move on their left flank! take their left flank! make sure they're down! corporal henderson: 101st! we're coming out! corporal henderson: that was a recon element, second s.s. we've been expecting a probe. that must have been it. captain miller, charlie company, 2nd rangers. corporal henderson, easy company, 501st. ryan, first of the 506th. p.f.c. toynbe, third of the 506th. james francis ryan? how'd you guess that? got hit pretty hard. small unit action. they came in and beat the hell out of us with 88s. tell you what, sir, if you're our relief, i'm gonna file a complaint. i wouldn't blame you. who's your c.o.? it would have been captain jennings, sir. i'm afraid the best we can muster up right now is a corporal. so, what are you guys all about? for him. ryan. of lowa? that's correct. what is this about? were killed in combat. which ones? uh... i'm afraid so. uh... you might want to take some time with this. if there's someplace you want to go and... what's this all about? ryan lost his brothers. which one? all of them. you came all the way out here to tell me that? well, you're-- you're going home. our orders are to bring you back. bring me back? corporal henderson... i don't mean to leave you even more shorthanded, but orders are orders. any communication about when you're going to be relieved up here? sir, there's no way to tell. we have no idea what's happening south of us. i have my orders, too, sir. they don't include me abandoning my post. i understand that, but this changes things. i don't see that it does, sir. the chief of staff for the united states army says it does. sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost. our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of 2. one at valognes and this one here. we let the germans take 'em, we'll lose our foothold and have to displace. private, your outfit wants to stay, that's one thing. your party's over here. sir, i can't leave until at least reinforcements-- you got 3 minutes to gather your gear. sir, what about them? there's barely enough-- 2 of our guys already died trying to find you, all right? sir? that's right. what were their names? irwin wade and adrian caparzo. wade and... caparzo. it doesn't make any sense. it doesn't make any sense, sir. why? why do i deserve to go? why not any of these guys? they all fought just as hard as me! is that what they're supposed to tell your mother when they send her another folded american flag? tell her that when you found me, i was here with the only brothers i have left. and that there's no way i was gonna desert them. i think she'll understand that. there's no way i'm leaving this bridge. what are your orders? sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here. the world has taken a turn for the surreal. clearly, but the question still stands. i don't know. what do you think? you don't want to know what i think. no, mike, i do. well... part of me thinks the kid's right. what's he done to deserve this? if he wants to stay here, fine. let's leave him and go home. yeah. but another part of me thinks... what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here? some day we might look back on this and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god-awful, shitty mess. that's what i was thinking, sir. like you said, captain, if we do that... we all earn the right to go home. oh, brother. this is everything. you got the 2 30-caliber machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 hawkins mines. you got the 2 bazookas, but they only got 8 rounds left, and assorted small arms. we had a 60 mortar, but an arty round took it out. might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks. which they're sure to do. what you thinking, sir? well... i'm thinking they're going to try to whip around the flanks-- them up this main road here in-between these buildings where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck. disable 'em? if we can. make that tank a 60-ton roadblock. we do that, we got a fighting chance at their flanks. yes, sir, that's good. split them up. don't let them mass anywhere. hit them hard as we can one-on-one and fall back to the bridge. machine gun on the move down here, number 2 up high somewhere to piss a little bad news on their heads. the idea. jackson? if we can, i'd like to get you up in that bell tower. yes, sir. give you a little company if you need it. yes, sir. some company couldn't hurt. i'd say a... a 30 with about a thousand rounds would be ok. parker, job opportunity. idea ever, captain. it's just that everything depends on getting the tank down this main road for us to knock out, right? so, how the hell do you plan on doing that? as our esteemed colleague from the airborne pointed out, what we got here are a bunch of spit wads, so how do we stop the tank if we get it to commit? give it a rabbit to chase. we could hit the tank in the tracks. yeah, but with what? well, we could try a sticky bomb. sticky bomb, sir? sir, are you making that up? no. it's in the field manual. you check it out if you want to. well, we seem to be out of field manuals, sir. perhaps you can enlighten us. all right, you have some demolition, don't you? some tnt or some composition "b"? that, sir, is the one thing we got plenty of. i got that bridge wired with enough composition "b" to blow it twice. all right, you can spare some, then. you take a standard-issue g.i. sock, cram it with as much comp "b" as it can hold, rig up a simple fuse, then you coat the whole thing with axle grease. that way, when you throw it, it should stick. it's a bomb that sticks. it's a sticky bomb. you come up with a better way to knock the tracks off a tank, i'm all ears. this is good. now we got to surrender our socks. haul away. all right, select the field of fire. cross fire with the one in the bell tower. all right. i can cover 12 to 9 from here. here are the mines. for being the best we can do, that forward machine gun is not in a terrible firing position. and this position right here... this is the alamo. they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge. we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man, you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long. captain? where am i during all this? never more than 2 feet away from me, and that's not negotiable. i'll get some ammo. come on. hey, upham. yes. listen to me, all right? yeah. you listening? yes. all right. we're going to be displacing and falling back like crazy sons of bitches... right up there. so you got to be johnny-on-the-spot with the ammo, or we're dead. right. you understand that? johnny-on-the-spot. yeah. you all right? hmm? yes. you know, when we were shipping out of england, the supply sergeant was handing out cartons of cigarettes, and i said, "no, thank you. i don't smoke. i don't smoke." quite a situation, huh? unbelievable. here. fucked up beyond all recognition, right? yeah, you got that right. fubar. ouch. ahem. yeah, well... fubar. it's going to be a real show, huh? yeah, ok. take it easy. fubar. who's that singing, sir? edith piaf. so upset about? her lover left her, but she still sees his face everywhere she goes. that would do it. even life itself only represents you. sometimes i dream that i'm in your arms. what was that part? she sang that before. that's the chorus. the chorus. and you speak softly in my ear... and you say things that make my eyes close. and i find that marvelous. uh, again... upham, uh... to be honest with you, l-- i find myself curiously aroused by you. marvelous. no, it's-- you know, it's a really melancholy song. at the beginning of the song, she says, "and then one day, you left. you left me, and, uh... i've been desperate ever since. i see you all over the sky. i see you all over the earth." any more songs like this, the krauts aren't going to have to shoot me. i'm just going to slit my own wrists. a strange bird, upham. ohh. i'm sorry. it's edith, you know. you know what that song reminds me of? it reminds me of mrs. rachel troubowitz and what she said to me the day i left for basic. what, "don't touch me"? no. mrs. rachel troubowitz is our super's wife. she comes into my mom's shop to try on a few things, all right? and she's easily, like, a 44 double "e." double "e"? these things are massive, right? those are big. no. and i've got her convinced that she's, like, a 42 "d," all right? so we're in the dressing room. she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere. and it's beautiful, because she's just pouring out of this thing, you know? is it really tight? no, no. it's beautiful. and she sees me, and she can tell i got a hard-on the size of the statue of liberty. and she says to me, "richard, calm down." and she says, "when you're over there, if you see anything that upsets you, or if you're ever scared, i want you to close your eyes and think of these. you understand?" so i said, "yes, ma'am." all right, sir? yeah. i'm just keeping the rhythm. is it true you were a teacher back home? yes. see, that's something i could never do, you know? not after the way me and my brothers treated our teachers. no, sir. i had a thousand kids like you. i can't see my brothers' faces. and i've been trying, and i can't see their faces at all. has that ever happened to you? you got to think of a context. what does that mean? well, you don't just think about their faces. you think about something specific-- something you've done together. well, when i think of home, i think of something specific. i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves. well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me. so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice-- alice jardine. i mean... picture a girl who just took a nose-dive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming down. and-- and dan's got her shirt off. so he's working on this bra, and he's trying to get it off, and all of a sudden, sean just screams out... "danny, you're a young man! don't do it!" and so alice jardine hears this, and she screams and she jumps up and she tries to get running out of the barn, but she's still got this shirt over her head. she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out. so now dan is just so mad at us. he-- he starts coming after us, but at the same time, alice is over there unconscious. he's got to wake her up. so he grabs her by a leg, and he's dragging her. at the same time, he picks up a shovel, and he's going after sean. and sean said, "what are you trying to hit me for? i just did you a favor." and so this makes dan more angry. he tries to swing this thing. he loses the shovel. it goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern. the thing explodes. the whole barn almost goes up because of this thing. uhh. that was it. that was the last-- that was-- dan went off to basic the next day. that was the last night the 4 of us were together. that was 2 years ago. hmm. oh, my. about your wife and those rose bushes. no. no. that one i save just for me. enemy from the east. he sees tiger tanks, 2 of them; panzer tanks, 2 of them; infantry, 50 plus change. disperse. you know what to do. reiben, get on the rabbit. yes, sir. get some cover. mellish and henderson, lock and load! everybody check your ammo! good luck, reiben. i don't need any luck, sarge. i was born lucky. one in five tracer?

"captain john h. miller." tell me i've led a good life. what? tell me i'm a good man. you are.
