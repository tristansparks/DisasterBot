Hi babe! I have something for you.
Just a little something.
Sure, it's yours.
Wow, you look so sexy, Lisa.
I would do anything for my girl.
Oh hi, Denny.
Anything for my princess! Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Nice to see you, Denny. I'm going to take a nap.
Ha-ha!
A-ha-ha.
You always think. A-ha-ha. Alright, I'm ready.
Oh, yeahhh.
A-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Ouch!
Denny, do you have something else to do?
Denny, two's great, but three's a crowd, ha-ha.
That's the idea!
Bye, Denny.
Did you like last night?
Ha-ha-ha.
Unh-unh. I have to go now.
Bye.
Hi.
Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?
That's me! How much is it?
Here you go, keep the change. Hi doggy!
Thanks a lot, bye!
Hi babe. These are for you.
Nah.
That son of a bitch told me that I would get it within three months. I save them bundles. They're crazy. I don't think I will ever get it. They betray me, they didn't keep their promise, they tricked me, and I don't care anymore.
Of course, what do you think? They already put my ideas into practice. The bank saves money, and they are using me, and I am the fool.
You're the only one who does.
Whatever, I don't care.
You think about everything, ha-ha.
I don't drink, you know that!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
You must be crazy. I cannot drink this.
You're right, it tastes good. A-ha.
Ha-ha-ha. A-ha-ha-ha. Mmm.
You have nice legs, Lisa. Ha-ha.
A-ha-ha. I'm tired, I'm wasted, I love you darling!
Unhhh'
I love you, Lisa.
Let's take him to the police.
Are you okay, Denny?
Are you okay?
Let's go home.
Why did you do this? You know better, right? Why?!
You know better, Denny, you almost got killed.
Let's go home.
I did not hit her! It's not true! It's bullshit! I did not hit her! I did not! Oh, hi Mark.
I have a problem with Lisa. She says that I hit her.
No, it's not true! Don't even ask! What's new with you?
Yeah.
What makes you say that?
I don't have to worry about that because Lisa is loyal to me.
A-ha-ha-ha! What a story, Mark!
I'm so happy I have you as my best friend, and I love Lisa so much.
Well maybe you should have a girl, Mark.
Well, what happened? Remember Betty? That's her name?
Yeah.
That's too bad. My Lisa is great when I can get it.
It seems to me like you're the expert, Mark!
What's bothering you, Mark?
Do you, do you have some secrets? Why don't you tell me?
Is there some secret, tell me.
Well, whatever.
Oh hi, Denny.
He's cranky today. A-ha-ha-ha. Girl trouble, I guess. What's new with you?
Sure, we are.
Well we'll see' Denny, don't plan too much. It may not come out right.
Okay.
Shoot, Denny.
Go on.
Go on.
Denny, don't worry about that. Lisa loves you too. As a person, as a human being, as a friend. You know people don't have to say it. They can feel it.
You can love someone deep inside your heart, and there is nothing wrong with it. If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live.
Denny, don't worry about it. You are part of our family, and we love you very much. And we will help you anytime. And Lisa loves you too. As a friend. You are sort of like her son.
No, because I trust you and I trust Lisa. What about Elizabeth, hunh?
M-hm.
That's the idea.
You're very welcome, Denny, and keep in mind, if you have any problems, talk to me, and I will help you.
Let's go eat, hunh? Come on, let's go. Let's go. I'm starving.
Hello Michelle. I heard you. What secret?
Did you get a new dress?
What's she talking about?
I never hit you. You shouldn't have any secrets from me. I'm your future husband.
Don't talk like that. What do you mean?
A-ha-ha-ha. You must be kidding, aren't you?
How dare you talk to me like that! You should tell me everything!
Why Lisa, why Lisa, please talk to me, please! You're part of my life, you are everything, I could not go on without you, Lisa.
You're lying, I never hit you. You are tearing me apart, Lisa!
Do you understand life? Do you?
You drive me crazy.
Don't worry about it. I still love you. Goodnight, Lisa.
Oh hi, Mike, what's new?
A-ha-ha.
Go on, I'm listening.
You must be kidding. Underwear, I got the picture.
That's life.
Yeah.
Oh hey, Denny.
Come on, it's good for you, come on.
Let's go for it.
He doesn't.
Hi Mark.
Mark, why don't you take him home? And Mike, listen, if you need anything, call me anytime, alright? Are you alright?
Let's go home, Denny.
How can they say this about me? I don't believe it. I show them. I will record everything.
I don't understand women. Do you, Peter?
They never say what they mean, and they always play games.
I have a serious problem with Lisa. Um, I don't think she's faithful to me. In fact I know she isn't.
Yeah I'm sure, I overheard a conversation between Lisa and her mother. What should I do, Peter?
Yeah.
But you're a psychologist. Do you have some advice?
I can't confront her! I want to give her a second chance, after all, she's my future wife. You know what they say: 'love is blind.'
Yeah. Oh hi, Mark. Come in.
We're just talking about women.
Can I meet her?
You mean she's too old, or you think I will take her away from you? Hunh?
I have my own problems.
Peter, you always play psychologist with us!
Lisa is teasing me about whether we are going to get married or not. And we didn't make love in a while. And I don't know what to do.
Not always!
You're right, Peter. Ha-ha. Is she getting a divorce, Mark?
I am, sure.
Ha-ha-ha, chicken, Peter, you're just a little chicken! Cheep, cheep cheep cheep cheep!
I don't mind. Mark, do you remember the one with big tits, the blondie one?
Ha-ha yeah, 'can you marry me?', ha-ha, I thought I would take her up on it, ha-ha.
Yeah, the barbecue chicken was delicious, rice, that was cool.
No we can't. I expect Lisa any minute.
Well that's a very interesting story, when I moved to San Francisco with two suitcases and I didn't know anyone and I have, uh, I head to YMCA with a $2000 check which I could not cash.
Well because it was an out of state bank. Anyway, uh, I was working as a busboy in a hotel, and uh, uh, she was sitting, drinking her coffee, and she was so beautiful, and I say hi to her. That's how we met.
Well the interesting part is that on our first date, she paid for dinner.
Whatever. Do you guys want to eat something?
Oh, thank you. Yeah, thanks a lot.
Oh, hi Denny. Nice tux, you look great.
A-ha-ha.
Oh, thanks.
Oh hey, Peter.
Sit down.
Wowwwwww.
You look great. You look a babyface.
A-ha.
Ask Peter.
Oh hi, Susan.
Hot chocolate, please.
Medium.
What happened now, Mark?
What makes you say that?
Well, you should be happy, Mark.
Oh, thank you so much.
Nah.
Oh, pretty good. We got a new client at the bank, we make a lot of money.
I cannot tell you, it's confidential.
No I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?
Why not?
Oh god, I have to run.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, sure, what time?
Right on, yeah.
Okey-dokey, Mark.
Hey.
Good.
Yeah, that's the idea.
Pretty good, yeah, you'd be qualified.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Well, we can talk about this tomorrow.
Yeah.
Absolutely. Three o'clock?
Bye, Lisa.
Oh hi, Claudette. Bye!
Thank you, honey. This is a beautiful party. You invited all my friends. Good thinking!
I do. Ha-ha-ha.
Mhm. A-ha-ha.
Hey everybody! I have an announcement to make. We're expecting!
What are you doing? What's going on here?
Maybe I know more than you think I do, Mark!
What do you want from me, hunh?
Alright, alright. Okay, folks, everything is fine. Fight is over, folks. I'm sorry, Mark.
Lisa, can, can you clean up here, please?
What are you doing?
You're my future wife. What are you doing, Lisa?
Since when do you give me orders?
I think you should leave right now, Mark.
Don't touch me, motherfucker! Get out.
Get out of my house! I kill you!
I kill you, you bastard.
You betrayed me, you're not good, you're just a chicken, cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep.
Shut up!
It's not over! Everybody betray me! I fed up with this world!
In a few minutes, bitch.
You and your stupid mother.
Who were you talking to?
We'll see about that.
We'll see about that.
You little tramp. How could you do this to me?! I gave you seven years of my life! And you betray me. Let's see what else we have on this tape.
I treat you like a princess, and you stab me in the back. I love you, and I did anything for you to just please you, and now you betray me! How could you love him?!
Aughhhhhhhh!!! Everybody betray me. I don't have a friend in the world.
Get out, get out, get out of my life! Agh!
Haughhhh-augh! Why, Lisa, why, why?!
You bitch!
You bitch! You bitch!
You tramp!
Why? Why is this happening to me? Why?! It's over. God, forgive me.
