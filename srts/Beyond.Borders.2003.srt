1
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,459
I wonder...

2
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:19,259
Do we all know where we belong?

3
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:23,299
And if we do, in our hearts,

4
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:26,780
why do we so often
do nothing about it?

5
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,300
There must be more to this life--

6
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,619
a purpose for us all,
a place to belong.

7
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:38,140
You were my home.

8
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,420
I knew from the moment I met you...

9
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,900
that night, so many years ago.

10
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,820
Well, come on and let me know

11
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,580
Should I stay or should I go?

12
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,820
Should I stay or should I go now?

13
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,821
Should I stay or should I go now?

14
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,860
If I go, there will be trouble

15
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,940
And if I stay, it will be double

16
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:15,181
So come on and let me know...

17
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,981
Thanks a lot.

18
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,902
Should I stay or should I go now?

19
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:45,942
Thank you.

20
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:49,262
If I go, there will be trouble

21
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,582
Thank you.

22
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:54,541
And if I stay, it will be double

23
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:57,542
So, you've got to let me know

24
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:01,902
Should I stay or should I go?

25
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,582
Thank you!

26
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,823
Thank you very much.

27
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,463
Lovely.

28
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:18,823
I want to thank the band.

29
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:21,063
After that racket,
I can only appear good.

30
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,463
Now, Margaret Thatcher...

31
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:23,983
you've got to hand it to her.

32
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:26,702
Love her or hate her,
Margaret Thatcher is definitely

33
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:28,583
the strongest man in the Tory Party.

34
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:30,303
Charley!

35
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:31,543
Hi, sis.

36
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:32,783
Oh, you're freezing.

37
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,823
I know... I couldn't get a cab--
God's punishment.

38
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:36,183
You don't believe in God.

39
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:37,303
I know. So that's Henry, huh?

40
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,023
Hm-mm.
- Very handsome.

41
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:40,304
Hi, I'm Charlotte.

42
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:41,704
How are you? Oh...

43
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:42,863
Oh, it's good to meet you.

44
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:43,903
Likewise.

45
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:45,063
I'm so sorry I missed the wedding.

46
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:46,063
No, no, no, no.

47
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:47,023
I'm sure she's already told you,

48
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:48,463
I'm crap at appointments
and times and stuff.

49
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:49,463
Well, she did mention...

50
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:50,743
Mind you, she is absolutely nuts,

51
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:52,544
but you married her,
so you must know, right?

52
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,264
We should introduce you around.

53
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:57,104
Come with me.

54
00:03:57,184 --> 00:04:00,183
Mom, Dad, may I introduce you
to Sarah's sister, Charlotte.

55
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:01,863
Yes, of course.

56
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:02,864
How do you do?

57
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,424
My parents, Mr. and Mrs. Bauford.

58
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:06,384
Oh, thank goodness, you both
have the same last name.

59
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:07,384
Good.

60
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:08,584
Pleasure to meet you, Charlotte,

61
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:09,624
or do you say Charley?

62
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:10,864
Um, right now, I'd say I'm a mess,

63
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,864
so if you don't mind...

64
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,425
I'll take you to the bathroom.

65
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:14,465
Okay.

66
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,465
Back in a sec.

67
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,464
Although, according to one
Ethiopian village log drummer,

68
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,304
it translates as "I've just
eaten a sodden grape pie."

69
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:23,464
Ha-ha.

70
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,145
Oh...

71
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,945
Sorry.

72
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,184
Look at you.

73
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:35,625
Oh, sweetie, you look beautiful.

74
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:36,625
Look at you.

75
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:38,225
Look at you... you're in a dress.

76
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:39,705
Oh, please, a dress.

77
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:41,905
I look like Ivana Trump
after a couple of rounds, baby.

78
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:42,905
Whew.

79
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:43,905
Come here.

80
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:44,945
What?

81
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,186
First, you've got to be kidding me.

82
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,465
You know this is pointless.

83
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,185
Oh, I hate this.

84
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,385
So what do you think of him?

85
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:56,065
I think he's an absolute sweetheart.

86
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:57,905
He's gorgeous, really, he is.

87
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:01,626
He is, and he's sweet
and he's funny and wild.

88
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:02,706
He's very English.

89
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:03,946
You married a very English Englishman.

90
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,225
You're blushing!

91
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:09,226
How's home?

92
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,426
Home's good. It misses you.

93
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:11,546
Work?

94
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:13,066
Oh, you know, very exciting.

95
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,266
They gave me a story
about a 10-car pile-up

96
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:16,306
on 54th Street.

97
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:17,386
You know, whatever.

98
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,066
Looking up?

99
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:21,147
Oh, top of the news pile, you know?

100
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,026
You will be.

101
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,986
Someday.

102
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,026
But on that note,

103
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,306
I think it's time I left the stage

104
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:29,106
and brought on someone
very special indeed.

105
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:30,866
Thank you very much.

106
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:34,707
Hi, um...

107
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:38,307
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. Bauford's son, Henry,

108
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:40,106
would like to make an announcement.

109
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:45,947
Thank you.

110
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,267
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

111
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:50,747
as you know, one of the reasons
we're here tonight

112
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:53,907
is to show our appreciation
to Lawrence Bauford

113
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,507
for all the great work he's done

114
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:59,027
as Chairman of Aid Relief International.

115
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,308
Sir... Sir!

116
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,708
Sarah!

117
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,548
Oh, darling.

118
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,068
She's cut.
- Oh God.

119
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,308
Are you all right?

120
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,628
You ask me, it's a bloody rip-off.

121
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,428
1,000 quid for an over-cooked meal

122
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,788
and a dry hump on the dance floor,

123
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,828
but still, we're all
getting drunk for a good cause.

124
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,588
Right?

125
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:40,029
Cheers.

126
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,669
Get him out of here.

127
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:44,748
It's a bit difficult...

128
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:45,748
Well, bloody do something.

129
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:49,028
20 quid a head right there.

130
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,389
Diwy a room rental, maybe another 20.

131
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:51,709
30 on catering.

132
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,469
It's got to be 50 quid on overhead.

133
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:54,629
There you go, Jojo.

134
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:55,989
That's your cut.

135
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:57,189
Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:59,389
You haven't met.

137
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,709
This is Jojo.

138
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,429
Actually, he's curious about your dinner

139
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,630
because when I met him,
he was so hungry

140
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,750
he was trying to eat his own tongue.

141
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,669
Funny enough, they don't do
Caesar salad with that.

142
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,669
No, listen,

143
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,429
I'll be honest, and I do want
to be honest.

144
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,469
He was a pile of bones

145
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:23,509
in a pool of shit,

146
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,790
and I don't mean civilized shit either.

147
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,270
This was the yellow stuff,

148
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,910
liquid fucking evil.

149
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,910
Anyhow, I've got 2,000 kids
in my camp in Africa

150
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,030
with the same problem,

151
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,309
and some fucking asshole here
has pulled our funding.

152
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:36,670
So I guess I'm just going
to have to feed them flies.

153
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,070
Now, Jojo here, he wanted to know why.

154
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,310
So I showed him this.

155
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,430
"Due to the repressive political climate,

156
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,590
"we can no longer sustain a relief presence

157
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,551
in Communist-supported Ethiopia."

158
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,151
Is that a fair description, Larry?

159
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,871
Or did you want a more positive spin?

160
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:51,470
All right, Dr. Callahan.

161
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,950
You've said your piece.

162
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,150
Now you can leave.

163
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,590
Why don't you come up here? Come on.

164
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,711
The kid just wants to hear
in words he can understand.

165
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,871
2,000 lives, what does that buy you?

166
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:00,871
A new car?

167
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,591
A new pair of tits for the wife?

168
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,231
Well, come on, don't be shy.

169
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:06,791
I've got a camp

170
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:10,271
with 30,000 people, dying at 40 a day.

171
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,271
I've got measles, typhoid, cholera...

172
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,511
every miserable fucking disease

173
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:14,511
known to man.

174
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,911
Six weeks from now, they'll all be dead.

175
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:19,071
Come on.

176
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:20,712
Talk to me.

177
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:01,112
Oh, I get it.

178
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,992
It's the monkey joke, right?

179
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,473
You want him to go...

180
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:08,073
for you, yeah?

181
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,273
Oh, he'll do that.

182
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,272
He'll do that for you.

183
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,753
Jojo...

184
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:38,194
300 calories in one banana--

185
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:39,394
more than he gets in a day.

186
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,954
He'll do whatever you want.

187
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:47,833
Jojo!

188
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,875
All right, you want to get down
out of the van now, please?

189
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:49,116
Sir?

190
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:51,036
Excuse me, sir.

191
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,115
Can you get down
from the vehicle now, please?

192
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,156
Come on. In you go.

193
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,917
Dr. Callahan, I presume?

194
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:42,437
I was there tonight.

195
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:44,877
I was compelled.

196
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:53,918
EGRIS.

197
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,038
Sounds pretentious enough to be a charity.

198
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,757
No, wait a minute, I remember.

199
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:01,317
I was in India when

200
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:03,317
you lot were working the
borders with Afghanistan.

201
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:05,358
Rumors were, you got in.

202
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,878
There's a lot of people
still dying over there.

203
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,038
They always do, Doctor.

204
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:12,238
Yeah, well, I'm no warrior.

205
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,798
I'm in the relief business.

206
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,678
So I gathered.

207
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:17,598
So, here we are--

208
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:21,318
you with your relief work,
me with my relief work.

209
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:25,078
And isn't it a strange coincidence,

210
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,679
because I need to get into Ethiopia,

211
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,679
and you're already there.

212
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,359
No thanks.

213
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:30,639
I'd fund your work

214
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,478
of course.

215
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:33,678
No.

216
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:38,119
"I've got a camp with 30,000
people, dying at 40 a day.

217
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,999
In 6 weeks time, they'll all be dead."

218
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,479
Slight exaggeration perhaps,

219
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,119
but very effective.

220
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,919
Since when did the CIA give a shit

221
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,279
about the starving in Africa?

222
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:53,319
I presume you are CIA, Mr. Steiger.

223
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,239
Idle curiosity...

224
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,959
Your performance tonight,

225
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,240
was it a cry for help,

226
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
or a cry for attention?

227
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,280
I'd call it a press conference.

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,079
No, a declaration of independence.

229
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,039
Freedom is an expensive commodity.

230
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:12,080
You should see what I paid for your bail.

231
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,840
No deal.

232
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,520
Passion is cheap, Doctor.

233
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,520
If you're looking for a dancing bear,

234
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,520
try the fucking circus.

235
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,040
Hmm. Cigarettes at dawn.

236
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,280
Either you're deliriously happy,
or you haven't slept.

237
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,601
Do you need me to call you a cab?

238
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,281
No, I already called one.

239
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,481
How's your hand?

240
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,521
Oh, it's fine.

241
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,321
So, Henry, is he, uh...?

242
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,681
Oh, he's-he's still sleeping.

243
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:58,721
Oh.

244
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:02,961
So...

245
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,801
I'm going to miss you.

246
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,642
Yeah, me, too.

247
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:07,642
But, you know, listen,

248
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,002
if it gets too English over here,

249
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,522
you give me a call, and l'll send you

250
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,961
a nice American care package
full of macaroni and cheese

251
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,761
and apple pie, and a pair of sneakers.

252
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:19,042
That'll go over well here in
fashionable London, I'm sure.

253
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:21,882
Hello?

254
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:25,362
Cab for Ms. Jordan.
- Okay, thank you.

255
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:26,802
Well, it's here.

256
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:27,961
Tell Mr. Sleepy Pants,

257
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,482
that I said good-bye, pip-pip, cheerio,

258
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,282
or whatever the hell they do here.

259
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:33,282
I love you.

260
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:34,602
I love you, too.

261
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:35,842
Bye, sis.

262
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,842
Take care.
- You, too.

263
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,722
...the boy escaped while being transferred

264
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:43,323
to the immigration
facility at Heathrow Airport.

265
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,122
His body was found early this morning

266
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,162
here under Junction 5.

267
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:49,482
Initial reports suggest
he died of hypothermia.

268
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:52,483
A spokesman for the Immigration Department

269
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:55,323
blamed the security lapse
on staff shortages.

270
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:58,043
We are told that the boy
was arrested the previous night

271
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:01,122
in a disturbance at a charity
ball in a London hotel.

272
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:04,043
A man identified as Nicholas Callahan,

273
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,963
a relief worker in Ethiopia,

274
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:08,443
interrupted the event
with an emotional plea

275
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,083
for more help in Africa.

276
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:13,363
At Junction 5, Aidan Pickering, LNS.

277
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:15,164
When Dubuque started,

278
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:17,163
you could see how much
she owed to Van Gogh.

279
00:15:17,243 --> 00:15:19,523
She didn't hide it;
it's in all her landscapes,

280
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:23,123
But if you look here, what she's
doing in this abstract

281
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:26,284
is something much more
calculated, more developed.

282
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:30,044
The way she takes the-the theme
of attraction and repulsion,

283
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:32,604
dark against light.

284
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:37,044
Over here, another piece, which I think

285
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,484
has even more emotional depth.

286
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,524
It's beautiful, isn't it?

287
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:43,284
Now, we do have...
other examples of her work,

288
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:45,124
which I think you should see.

289
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,165
Sweetheart, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

290
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:49,525
Yes, I do.

291
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,604
And before you say anything, I've spoken

292
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,164
to all the relevant relief
organizations and embassies,

293
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,324
and with 40,000 pounds...

294
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:56,324
40,000 pounds?

295
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:57,564
What are you talking about?

296
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:59,005
Where are you going to find 40,000...?

297
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,085
...and supplies from surplus
regions in Southern Sudan.

298
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,965
And from there, I transport them to Tigre.

299
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,205
I've cleared out my savings,

300
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:06,844
I'm still short about 8,000.

301
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,564
But, Sarah, this isn't how it's done.

302
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:09,564
You don't go...

303
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:11,205
Henry, Henry. I've made up my mind.

304
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:13,885
Well, then send the money,
do charitable work, whatever,

305
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:14,925
but don't go roaring off

306
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,365
to some godforsaken hole in Africa

307
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:17,685
just to salve your conscience.

308
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:18,725
It's just too...

309
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,045
Too what?

310
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,206
Well, it's not the most
grown-up way to deal with

311
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:23,045
this situation.

312
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,165
Well, maybe I don't want to grow up.

313
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,606
Fine...

314
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:36,046
Fine.

315
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,086
If that's what you want,

316
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,846
It is.
- Then fine.

317
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:40,965
Then...

318
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:42,325
I'll help you find the money.

319
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:45,486
Thank you.

320
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:47,046
I'll talk to Dad.

321
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:49,206
He knows everybody.

322
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:51,486
Mind you, Ethiopia is a bit...

323
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:52,886
It'll be fine.

324
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:56,446
It'll be fine. We'll find the money.

325
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,366
Come with me.

326
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:00,966
Honey, even if I could...

327
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,086
You can't?

328
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,286
No, it's not that.

329
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,326
You know me, I'm not made
for that kind of thing.

330
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:08,127
I'm a city boy. I need 4 walls and a bed.

331
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,847
Besides, I've got meetings up to here

332
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:10,967
for the next month.

333
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:19,167
You should go.

334
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,767
You've got the right attitude.

335
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,927
Listen, I know this sounds
like Little Miss Bleeding Heart

336
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:28,368
and all that... I just, I don't care.

337
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,247
I know I'm being crazy
and driving you crazy,

338
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:33,607
and of course I understand
you can't come, but...

339
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,287
you meet me off the plane?

340
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,247
You meet me off the plane?

341
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,288
Of course l'll meet you off the plane.

342
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:44,089
Three years and no rain, not a drop.

343
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:45,529
That, and war.

344
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:50,490
People leave their homes,
they walk for many days.

345
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,049
We only have 10 camps on the south side.

346
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:55,289
Too many people, not enough camps.

347
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,210
Measles, you know measles?

348
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,370
Yes, of course.

349
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,890
We lose more people
to measles and diarrhea.

350
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,570
Many die, no vaccine.

351
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,370
We brought some vaccines...
- Also cholera, everywhere.

352
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,690
We dig very deep now for good water.

353
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,131
Starvation everywhere, death is everywhere.

354
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,770
You speak English very well.

355
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,570
Missionaries teach me.

356
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,051
Yeah?

357
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,291
So are you married?

358
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,251
Do you have a husband?
- Man? Bullshit.

359
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:37,371
I need no man.

360
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,651
They beg to marry me, many times,

361
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:41,290
but I drive truck.

362
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,691
Lazy man, good-for-nothing.

363
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:45,811
I'm too old now anyway.

364
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,051
No man in my village want woman over 18.

365
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:50,211
In my tribe, it's 30.

366
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,692
Stop.

367
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:59,371
Stop the truck. Stop. Stop!

368
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:29,053
Abraha!

369
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,372
Abraha!

370
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:37,332
Abraha...

371
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,653
Is this your son?

372
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:47,172
This your son?

373
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:49,893
Abraha...

374
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,093
Abraha?

375
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,013
Ab-Ab...

376
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:56,933
No baby.

377
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:59,533
We go. Too dangerous to stop.

378
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,534
We go now.

379
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,574
Is a waste.

380
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:19,174
Child and mother, both a waste.

381
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:20,693
Stupid baby woman.

382
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:01,179
Tula, shut up.

383
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:09,378
I'll give you 4 bags.

384
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,859
4 bags not enough.

385
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:13,899
I take 1 truck.

386
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:16,419
You want to tell them that
you're taking half their food?

387
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:17,979
How many are you? 50? A hundred?

388
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,059
My men fight...

389
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:20,699
I know, I know-- for the people.

390
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:21,698
Mm.

391
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,499
It's good.

392
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,900
No. No, no, no, no.

393
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,980
8 bags.

394
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,980
4 each truck.

395
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,660
This is fair.

396
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,301
Hmm, Mr. Elliott?

397
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,421
Fair, yes?

398
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,861
Welcome to famine relief.

399
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,341
Okay, kill it!

400
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,462
Hold his legs, okay?

401
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:32,783
Excuse me.

402
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,102
Excuse me.

403
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,102
This child, his mother's in the truck.

404
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:37,343
She's wounded.

405
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:57,303
Too late.
- What?

406
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,744
Too late, as in no point.

407
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,744
Why?

408
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:01,944
Why?

409
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:04,864
Well, quite apart from
any illnesses they may have,

410
00:27:04,944 --> 00:27:06,424
they're too weak to survive.

411
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:08,823
You, just...

412
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,023
You just decide that?

413
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:11,664
It's called triage. I'm a doctor.

414
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
I've got 30,000...
- I know.

415
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,584
I heard that already in London.

416
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:17,304
You did?

417
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:19,024
Yes. I still think you should help them.

418
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,144
Oh, you do, do you?

419
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:21,184
Yes, I do.

420
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,705
I see. You pay for these trucks,

421
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:25,144
so I have to indulge
some fucking white girl's idea

422
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:26,144
of heroism, right?

423
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:27,784
Well, why stop there?
Do you want a picture?

424
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:28,864
I can get you a picture

425
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:31,264
of "poor little rich girl
holds dying black baby."

426
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:33,305
You do your hair right, you'll look great.

427
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,065
I saw the child from the truck.

428
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:37,465
I picked him up,
his mother was wounded.

429
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:39,465
I brought her, too.

430
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:40,944
Can you please look at them?

431
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:49,625
Seems fair.

432
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,785
Kat.

433
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:01,945
Hi.

434
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,905
Hi. I'm Kat.

435
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,706
Okay, so... I'm the chief administrator

436
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:14,265
and logistician, if that
doesn't sound too pompous,

437
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,665
and you've met Nick,

438
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:18,626
who's our team leader and full-time doctor.

439
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:20,626
He's got a lot on his hands right now.

440
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:31,386
So this is the food-distribution center.

441
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:32,986
Low-tech but effective,

442
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:35,426
like the rest of us.

443
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,986
The food supplies I brought,
how long will they last?

444
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:40,907
Oh, 3 or 4 days, maybe.

445
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,187
That's it?

446
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:45,387
I'm afraid so, yeah.

447
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:46,906
What are you going to do
when the food runs out?

448
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,066
Well, we usually find a way.

449
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,587
Same old story really, you know--

450
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:54,267
money, or the lack of it,

451
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:56,707
but with help, we get by.

452
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,988
Um, I don't think you want to go...

453
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:36,108
Is it all right?

454
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:38,668
Sure. Yeah.

455
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:46,188
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Bauford.

456
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:50,789
Sorry about the mess.

457
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,668
You won't see this in medical school.

458
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,989
Cut.

459
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:06,389
If you're going to throw up,

460
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:07,469
close your eyes.

461
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,469
Think of ponies

462
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,829
and ice cream.

463
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:12,189
Is that... perfume?

464
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:18,469
You're wearing perfume in the
middle of the fucking desert.

465
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:20,109
Ha-ha.

466
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,670
The boy, has he been looked at?

467
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,349
Yes, ma'am. Checking him now.

468
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:27,789
One shed over.

469
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,149
As you instructed.

470
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,950
What does it mean?
- Sew it up.

471
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,550
Monica, get her a Fanta.

472
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,350
It's weird isn't it?

473
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,631
All those plans you have,

474
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:55,951
places to go, people to meet.

475
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:57,991
All that matters
in her whole world is that.

476
00:30:58,031 --> 00:31:01,230
Just one suck of soda,
that's all she lives for.

477
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,390
She's in pain--
can't you give her something?

478
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,390
Oh, yeah, sure.

479
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,871
Monica, call down to the pharmacy

480
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,231
for more morphine, could you?

481
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:09,231
Where do you think you are, Saint Elsewhere?

482
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:10,511
She's in pain.

483
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:11,511
She's beyond pain.

484
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:12,471
Have you asked her that?

485
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:16,951
Hamadi.

486
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:18,311
Ask her if it hurts.

487
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,112
She, uh...

488
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:44,952
says she feels the pain of hunger, but

489
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,632
she knows that death more hungry than pain,

490
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:48,631
so, she gives thanks.

491
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:50,952
She gives thanks to you.

492
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:53,432
She calls you by a new name.

493
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,672
Matanay.

494
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:57,832
"He who steals from Death."

495
00:32:35,794 --> 00:32:38,073
He's got a fever, and he's in shock.

496
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:42,273
Increase the fluids. Antibiotics.

497
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:51,474
You really think he's going
to sit up and take a drink?

498
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,474
I was just...

499
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,474
He's dying.

500
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,633
You'd better move his lips,

501
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:55,713
or he won't take a cup.

502
00:32:55,793 --> 00:32:56,873
I was just trying to help.

503
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:57,874
To help, you have

504
00:32:57,954 --> 00:32:58,954
to know what you're doing.

505
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,394
Look, I know you think I'm stupid,

506
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:01,594
and you want me to go home.

507
00:33:01,674 --> 00:33:03,194
You don't have to waste any more time

508
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:04,994
trying to make that clear to me.

509
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:12,914
Get some H.E.M.

510
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:14,194
High Energy Milk.

511
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:16,194
Monica will give it to you.

512
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,514
You tease around his mouth with your finger.

513
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:20,875
You let him suck it out, small amounts only.

514
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,475
If he revives, call the nurse.

515
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:24,715
If he doesn't...

516
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,954
at least he'll have someone
with him when he dies.

517
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:20,516
How many?

518
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:23,436
Kat?

519
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:25,516
11 from last night.

520
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,837
12.

521
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,157
The 10-year-old.

522
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:31,157
That makes 39.

523
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:32,437
So there's more than yesterday.

524
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,436
I know.

525
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:34,756
Right, and you'd better hire

526
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:37,356
extra men from the camp
and get them digging more holes.

527
00:34:37,436 --> 00:34:39,397
Put them on night shift
so nobody sees them.

528
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,357
Can't have people dying
of depression, eh?

529
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:47,717
How's the water coming, Joss?

530
00:34:49,198 --> 00:34:50,117
Nothing so far.

531
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:51,837
Drive shaft is close to buggering,

532
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:54,357
and we're down to 2 liters
per person per day.

533
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:56,157
What about the tankers?

534
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:58,037
Yeah, sure. That's piss in a bucket, mate.

535
00:34:58,117 --> 00:34:59,797
Basically, if we don't get the new well

536
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:01,518
up and running, we're knackered.

537
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:03,158
Okay, so what do you need exactly?

538
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:04,158
I just told you.

539
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,798
A new drive shaft.

540
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:08,597
Okay, I'm going to see what I can do.

541
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,398
Well, the good news, boys and girls,

542
00:35:18,478 --> 00:35:21,358
is that the government's
finally coming tomorrow.

543
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,758
I got confirmation today

544
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:24,838
that Mr. Ningpopo himself will be here.

545
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,718
For about an hour.

546
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:27,918
That long?

547
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:28,918
Well, you never know.

548
00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:29,998
We might get lucky.
- Right.

549
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:31,118
Here's what we're going to do.

550
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,518
First thing in the morning, we're going

551
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:33,518
to break open the new supplies,

552
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,559
start immunizing all the children

553
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,559
against measles, youngest first,

554
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,159
up the line, until we run out.

555
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,679
Okay? Kat, Monica: I want you

556
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,238
to get onto that as early as possible.

557
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:41,318
All right.

558
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:43,718
I'll set up the call chain
and check the syringes.

559
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:45,439
No, I'm going to need you
with me, and you, Tula.

560
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,679
Joss.
- Yeah.

561
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,079
Sanitation.

562
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,919
I think you need to take your team

563
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,359
and cut a new defecation area
somewhere beyond the camp.

564
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:53,359
Yeah, and let's just

565
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:54,359
chlorinate all the water, okay?

566
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,399
All of it.

567
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:56,999
Yeah, the tankard water is absolutely fine.

568
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,999
Fuck the tanker water.
Just chlorinate the lot.

569
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,599
There's too much infection
to risk leaving it, okay?

570
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,759
Okay.

571
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,999
Okay.

572
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,159
Good.

573
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,119
All right, make sure
you get me your requests

574
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,200
for Ningpopo as soon as possible.

575
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,800
Two hookers and a single to Melbourne.

576
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,279
Business or coach?

577
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,520
Good night, Sarah.

578
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,520
Good night.

579
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,519
Oh, I forgot.

580
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,520
The boy's mother.

581
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,880
She died.

582
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,680
We've got about 10 days left.

583
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,561
Maybe 2 weeks, if we're lucky.

584
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:55,961
What happened with USAID?

585
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:57,361
Nothing.

586
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:58,721
CARE?

587
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,241
CARE, USAID, the OXFAM, WFB...

588
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,480
they don't want to know.

589
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,481
Everyone I spoke to

590
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:05,481
in Addis had an acute case

591
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:06,481
of compassion fatigue.

592
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:07,481
How 'bout the old man?

593
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,881
The trust fund?

594
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:12,361
My father was the politest
"fuck you" I ever got.

595
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:17,042
What about Steiger?

596
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:18,921
Some small favors,

597
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:20,401
a little info on...

598
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:21,521
Yeah, stash a shitload of weapons...

599
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:23,481
So what if he's fucking over the Marxists...

600
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:24,961
I'm not getting into business
with those people.

601
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,282
Listen, Elliott, if it's
all we got, I don't see why...

602
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:29,522
There is no way...
- Why not for, Christ's sake?

603
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:32,282
Because that's not how we started!

604
00:37:32,362 --> 00:37:36,561
And because I wouldn't
have it any other way.

605
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:44,842
What the hell is that?

606
00:37:44,922 --> 00:37:49,003
Schumann, I think.

607
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:41,003
Hi.

608
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:54,524
"I dream of childhood.

609
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:58,164
"I dream of love.

610
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:01,004
"Of a garden where a boy plays,

611
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:03,244
forever young."

612
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:06,484
"Themes from Childhood."

613
00:39:06,565 --> 00:39:10,925
Part of a series
from Schumann's "Lederhosen."

614
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:13,565
Lederhosen are trousers.

615
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,084
Ah.

616
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:19,845
The German for song is lieder.

617
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,485
Lieder.

618
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:23,925
Yes, correct.

619
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:36,845
Is there something you wanted?

620
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:41,326
The baby.

621
00:39:41,406 --> 00:39:43,566
You tried the H.E.M.?

622
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,086
Yes.

623
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,845
And?

624
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,845
And no change.

625
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:53,246
Sometimes it takes a while.

626
00:41:30,848 --> 00:41:33,169
Hey, woman, come, come.

627
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,850
Yes.

628
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:18,970
One life.

629
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,850
Ningpopo's here.

630
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,650
Look right now
we're at 800 calories a day.

631
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,051
In a few days it will be down to 500.

632
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,051
The bottom line is,

633
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:45,291
we're not going to make
next week's distribution.

634
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:46,571
Not a chance.

635
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:48,450
And that raises the issue of security.

636
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,330
If I can't get these people more food,

637
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,331
I can't guarantee the safety of my staff.

638
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:53,531
Food, security.

639
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:55,331
I believe these are listed
as separate issues.

640
00:42:55,411 --> 00:42:59,131
Yes, but I'm sure you'd
agree they're connected.

641
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:20,092
Well, if we could get some emergency corn,

642
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:21,132
that'd be a start.

643
00:43:21,172 --> 00:43:24,092
I will raise it with the WFB.

644
00:43:24,172 --> 00:43:25,092
Thank you.

645
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:26,412
They owe us since August anyway.

646
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:27,612
Excuse me?
- Any emergency corn

647
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:28,892
would be greatly appreciated.

648
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:30,052
I'm sorry, excuse me, who owes you?

649
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:31,412
The WFB. 3 months of corn.

650
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:32,452
It'll be in your notes.

651
00:43:32,532 --> 00:43:34,572
There's no reference to the WFB in my notes.

652
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:35,493
Then your notes are wrong.

653
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:37,013
Okay, we can move on...

654
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:38,612
to the issue of security.

655
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:41,052
Our soldiers have no experience
of this order, Mr. Hauser.

656
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:43,572
Please, we have another meeting
at Kromer Camp at 4:00 p.m.

657
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:45,412
If we can deal with
these matters separately

658
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:46,453
and in the proper order.

659
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:49,013
It is no good to jump from food to security.

660
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,013
This is not coherent.

661
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:51,173
Not coherent?

662
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,933
Listen, they don't get
enough food, they get hungry.

663
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:54,253
If they get hungry, they get desperate,

664
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,252
they wreck the camp.

665
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,412
That is a security issue.

666
00:43:56,492 --> 00:43:57,572
Please do not raise your voice.

667
00:43:57,653 --> 00:44:00,133
For Christ's sake, they're
all fucking dying out there.

668
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:01,853
Will you please stop talking bollocks

669
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:03,813
and start getting some food delivered now.

670
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,933
No excuses, no money changing hands,

671
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,173
just do it.

672
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:09,214
I find this innuendo most
disturbing, Dr. Callahan.

673
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:11,293
I can assure you, not
a single dollar changes hands

674
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:12,933
without authorization.

675
00:44:13,013 --> 00:44:14,733
Procedures of the utmost importance...

676
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:15,933
Procedures, my fucking ass.

677
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:17,613
You've got friends
in the water-trucking business

678
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,613
whose sole aim in life

679
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:20,534
is to hike up the price
by restricting delivery.

680
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,534
You seriously telling me

681
00:44:21,574 --> 00:44:23,094
those shitheads are following procedure?

682
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:24,134
I find this outrageous,

683
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:25,134
especially coming from you.

684
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:26,374
What do you mean especially coming from me?

685
00:44:26,454 --> 00:44:28,133
To take a refugee boy from the camp

686
00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:29,293
without authorization

687
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:32,214
to die like an animal
in a country he does not know?

688
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,374
The death of a child

689
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:35,534
is not a minor violation, Dr. Callahan.

690
00:44:35,614 --> 00:44:36,734
I can assure you,

691
00:44:36,814 --> 00:44:39,854
you are under serious investigation.

692
00:44:55,455 --> 00:44:56,375
What?

693
00:45:00,015 --> 00:45:01,574
He'd never have given us anything anyway.

694
00:45:01,654 --> 00:45:04,334
Well, he certainly isn't going to now.

695
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:05,615
What happened to his car?

696
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:13,455
Will that fit our wellhead?

697
00:45:13,495 --> 00:45:16,496
Do kangaroos crap in the bush?

698
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:28,536
We've got no choice.

699
00:45:28,616 --> 00:45:30,496
We need Steiger.

700
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:44,016
Dr. Callahan?

701
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:04,217
Sorry, I...

702
00:46:04,297 --> 00:46:06,177
I just have some traveler's checks.

703
00:46:06,257 --> 00:46:09,576
I'm leaving tomorrow, so I...
I thought I'd leave them here.

704
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:12,297
Elliott usually deals with all that.

705
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:13,857
Should I give them...?

706
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,697
No, I mean, it's okay,
I'll give them to him.

707
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:16,777
Okay.

708
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:22,577
So... is he going to shut you down?

709
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:24,177
Maybe.

710
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:28,297
But we always turn up again... somewhere.

711
00:46:28,377 --> 00:46:31,577
I really admire you for the work you do.

712
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,617
Oh, Jesus. "Admire," what does that mean?

713
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:34,818
Why are you so difficult

714
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,578
to talk to?
- Why are you?

715
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:38,618
Why do you never say my name?

716
00:46:38,738 --> 00:46:40,417
Sorry?

717
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,497
You never say my name.

718
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:43,977
Why?

719
00:46:44,057 --> 00:46:47,738
What's the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

720
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:49,138
What?

721
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:50,578
What is the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

722
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,537
Chicken soup, aspirin, scotch.

723
00:46:56,577 --> 00:46:58,098
You ever just have the cold?

724
00:46:59,258 --> 00:47:00,218
I don't under...

725
00:47:00,258 --> 00:47:02,058
Taken nothing, just have the cold.

726
00:47:02,138 --> 00:47:03,058
No.
- No.

727
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:04,618
And that's us, right?

728
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:06,778
We drown it, kill it, numb it.

729
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,459
Anything not to feel.

730
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:10,619
You know, when I was a doctor in London,

731
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:12,299
no one ever said "matanay."

732
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,458
They don't thank you
like they thank you here

733
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,058
'cause here they feel everything.

734
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:17,258
Straight from God.

735
00:47:17,298 --> 00:47:20,099
There's no drugs, there's no painkillers.

736
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:27,019
It's the weirdest, purest thing-- suffering.

737
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:30,379
And when you've seen that
kind of courage in a lit...

738
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:38,619
...in a child...

739
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:40,659
how could you ever want to do anything

740
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:42,380
but just take them in your arm?

741
00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:52,740
You remember that boy in London. Jojo?

742
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,780
Yes, of course.

743
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,580
He was my first save, 10 years old.

744
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,020
So thin he could barely stand.

745
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,419
But he still found the strength
to bury the rest of his family.

746
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,060
We have no idea what courage is.

747
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,221
He used to write me these little notes.

748
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:17,261
He helped me in the clinic.

749
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:20,620
He was good.

750
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,420
He was sweet, he was good.

751
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,900
He wanted to be like me, I liked that.

752
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,421
I mean, it was silly and childish,

753
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,221
but it made me feel good about myself.

754
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:29,981
So I took him with me to London,

755
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:32,341
you know, my talisman, my courageous Africa.

756
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,021
How could I be so bloody stupid?

757
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:42,701
How could I be so totally selfish?

758
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:57,021
The point is...

759
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:01,542
he was my friend.

760
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:05,382
He had a name.

761
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:08,142
So now I have to remember him.

762
00:49:13,302 --> 00:49:17,102
If everyone I lose has a name...

763
00:49:48,183 --> 00:49:49,303
Hey.

764
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:50,303
Hey.

765
00:49:50,343 --> 00:49:51,623
You all set?

766
00:49:51,703 --> 00:49:52,863
Yeah.

767
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:54,263
Said your good-byes?

768
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:55,423
Yeah.

769
00:49:55,503 --> 00:49:56,784
Well.

770
00:49:56,864 --> 00:49:57,784
Yeah.

771
00:49:57,863 --> 00:49:58,783
Oh, um,

772
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:02,183
this is my friend at UNHCR.

773
00:50:02,223 --> 00:50:04,583
She'll always know how to get ahold of us.

774
00:50:04,623 --> 00:50:06,463
And that's a very good group of people.

775
00:50:06,543 --> 00:50:08,584
If you ever want to jump in there...

776
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:09,664
Okay.

777
00:50:09,784 --> 00:50:10,864
Um...

778
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:14,064
I'm so glad that you came, Sarah.

779
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,143
It meant a lot to us.

780
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:17,143
Oh, thank you.

781
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,264
No, no, I'm thanking you.

782
00:50:20,624 --> 00:50:22,424
Mikanalay.

783
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:24,064
It means "thank you."

784
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:25,704
And then you say, "Genzubka,"

785
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:28,504
which means, "You're welcome."

786
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:29,505
Genzubka.

787
00:50:29,585 --> 00:50:31,504
Yeah, pretty good.

788
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:33,104
Well, very Buddhist.

789
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:34,584
Do Buddhists hug?

790
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,624
Sure I hug, I'm American.

791
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:38,144
I hug everything.

792
00:50:48,184 --> 00:50:49,424
Ah, Nick's up at the well.

793
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,744
You want me to get him?
- No, no.

794
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:55,145
Good-bye.

795
00:50:55,225 --> 00:50:56,385
Good-bye.

796
00:50:56,465 --> 00:50:58,465
You take care of yourself...

797
00:50:58,545 --> 00:51:00,225
and everybody else.

798
00:51:00,305 --> 00:51:02,145
I'll try.

799
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,666
Keep in touch.

800
00:52:19,507 --> 00:52:20,707
Jim.

801
00:52:20,827 --> 00:52:22,028
Hey, come on.

802
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:23,028
Jim!

803
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:24,708
Baby, Mommy's got some work to do.

804
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:25,868
Come on, honey. Come here.

805
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:27,027
It's okay. It's okay, sweetie.

806
00:52:27,107 --> 00:52:28,387
Honey, I'm going to count to 5.

807
00:52:28,427 --> 00:52:29,387
No.
- One...

808
00:52:29,427 --> 00:52:30,947
two, three...

809
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:33,228
I'll read you 2 chapters.

810
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:34,588
No. 3.

811
00:52:34,668 --> 00:52:36,868
Okay, 3.

812
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:39,068
You are nothing

813
00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:40,468
but a minx-ish minx.

814
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:41,828
Daddy!

815
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:45,508
Yeah, hello.

816
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:47,588
Mommy says I can have 3 chapters.

817
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:48,588
3 chapters?

818
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:50,148
Excellent.

819
00:52:50,228 --> 00:52:51,428
Would you mind reading to him tonight?

820
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:52,268
I have some work to do.

821
00:52:52,348 --> 00:52:53,428
Sure.

822
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:55,229
Jim, go on, jump into bed.

823
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:56,549
Oh!
- Quick kicks!

824
00:52:56,629 --> 00:52:58,429
Dad'll be there in a minute.

825
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:02,148
So what's he reading?

826
00:53:02,228 --> 00:53:03,628
It's on his bedside table.

827
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:05,788
Right.

828
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:08,509
About tomorrow...

829
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:09,829
I'm in the office all day.

830
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:11,669
It's just, I need
to keep looking for work.

831
00:53:11,749 --> 00:53:13,789
I thought you were going
to make calls from home.

832
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:15,069
Well, I-I just should go in.

833
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,228
Half the city is looking.

834
00:53:16,308 --> 00:53:17,709
I can't compete unless I'm there.

835
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:19,949
Can't your father call somebody?

836
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:22,709
He's already done everything he can.

837
00:53:22,749 --> 00:53:24,509
Dad lost everything in the market crash,

838
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:25,509
like everybody else.

839
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:26,709
I know that.

840
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,510
I know, I'm sorry.

841
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,510
I'm sorry.

842
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,190
So...

843
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,389
I think I should go in.

844
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:34,949
Henry, I arranged meetings,

845
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:37,389
especially because you said
you'd do the school run.

846
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:39,309
Well, can't we ask someone?

847
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,830
There must be people at his school...

848
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,790
You call.

849
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:43,590
I'm sick of asking for favors.

850
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,470
Don't. Don't!

851
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,470
You didn't bother doing it
in the first place,

852
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,469
don't do it now.

853
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:50,469
I was trying to help.

854
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:51,470
No, you were bargaining.

855
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,750
What if I was?

856
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,390
Is that a crime?

857
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:59,150
You know, because I can argue...

858
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,670
I can shout.

859
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:03,991
I hate this situation.

860
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:06,870
I hate not having a job.

861
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,070
I don't see what good

862
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,510
it does to make each other
feel worse than we already do.

863
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:19,711
Sarah.

864
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:21,951
Look at this room-- it's a mess.

865
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:23,830
We'll sort it out.

866
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,391
Things will pick up.

867
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,911
There's a chance, I've got
a meeting with this guy

868
00:54:29,991 --> 00:54:31,271
who's really big in futures,

869
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,631
and I'm going to try
and get a meeting with him.

870
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:38,352
We will sort it out.

871
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:43,871
He's waiting for you to read to him.

872
00:54:50,272 --> 00:54:51,312
Okay.

873
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:09,873
Thanks.

874
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:11,353
I understand.

875
00:55:12,552 --> 00:55:15,192
Michael... Michael, that's bullshit.

876
00:55:16,392 --> 00:55:20,152
UNHCR sends more aid to Honduras
than any other UN agency.

877
00:55:20,232 --> 00:55:22,233
Even as I speak...

878
00:55:22,313 --> 00:55:24,193
Well, most people don't even
know where Honduras is.

879
00:55:24,273 --> 00:55:25,873
...East and West Berliners alike
are tearing down

880
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:27,473
the greatest symbol
of Communist repression...

881
00:55:27,553 --> 00:55:28,472
No.

882
00:55:28,552 --> 00:55:31,953
North of Panama in the Caribbean Sea.

883
00:55:32,033 --> 00:55:34,513
But you must keep repeating it
to yourself to believe it.

884
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:36,193
The Berlin Wall is finally coming down.

885
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:39,073
And the sense of hope you get here...

886
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:40,593
Which is precisely why I need aid.

887
00:55:40,673 --> 00:55:42,633
November 9, 1989,

888
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:44,953
a night that marked the opening
of a new chapter

889
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:46,113
in world history.

890
00:55:46,193 --> 00:55:47,553
Michael, I have to call you back.

891
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:48,673
Okay.

892
00:55:48,793 --> 00:55:50,233
UNHCR.

893
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,393
Sarah?

894
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,753
Yes. Who's calling?

895
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:54,674
Uh, it's me, Elliott.

896
00:55:54,794 --> 00:55:56,354
Elliott?

897
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,674
Hi.

898
00:55:57,794 --> 00:55:58,914
Hi!

899
00:55:58,994 --> 00:56:00,794
How... how are you? Are you okay?

900
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,833
Oh, oh, yeah.

901
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:02,833
Where are you?

902
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:05,193
Um, Oh, I'm actually, believe it or not,

903
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:08,034
I'm here in a phone booth in-in London.

904
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:10,034
Oh, my God.

905
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:11,914
You know, I'm sorry,
there's a terrible connection...

906
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,954
but nothing seems to work
in this shitty place.

907
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:15,114
When can I see you?

908
00:56:15,194 --> 00:56:17,475
Oh, uh, well, um...

909
00:56:17,515 --> 00:56:20,474
I'm in the Holland Park
Tube Station right now.

910
00:56:20,554 --> 00:56:22,794
Uh, could you meet me
by the entrance to the park?

911
00:56:22,874 --> 00:56:24,034
Yeah.

912
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,914
Oh...
- Yes, yes, of course!

913
00:56:25,994 --> 00:56:27,234
Great.
- Um, uh...

914
00:56:27,314 --> 00:56:29,395
1:30, is that... is that okay?

915
00:56:29,475 --> 00:56:30,475
Sounds perfect.

916
00:56:47,955 --> 00:56:49,075
Henry?

917
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:50,076
Hi, honey.

918
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,635
Bea just popped around to say hello.

919
00:56:51,715 --> 00:56:53,675
Do you remember Bea?
She used to work with Dad.

920
00:56:53,795 --> 00:56:54,795
Hi, there.

921
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,195
Hi.

922
00:56:57,555 --> 00:56:59,595
I thought you had job interviews today.

923
00:56:59,635 --> 00:57:02,316
Uh, they all got canceled.

924
00:57:02,396 --> 00:57:03,556
Oh.

925
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,155
I-I just came by to get
some warm stuff for Jimmy,

926
00:57:10,235 --> 00:57:11,715
so I'm going to go pick him up.

927
00:57:26,156 --> 00:57:27,836
Hello.

928
00:57:33,156 --> 00:57:34,636
Hey.

929
00:57:34,716 --> 00:57:35,997
He-He-Hey.

930
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,597
Oh...

931
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:40,237
Oh, my gosh. Look at you.

932
00:57:40,277 --> 00:57:41,996
Here, come, sit.

933
00:57:44,316 --> 00:57:46,397
Oh, gosh, it's good to see you.

934
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:47,757
Well, you, too.

935
00:57:47,837 --> 00:57:50,317
So you got my last letter?

936
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:52,117
Yeah. You were in Pakistan.

937
00:57:52,197 --> 00:57:53,317
Pakistan?

938
00:57:53,357 --> 00:57:54,957
That was months ago.

939
00:57:55,037 --> 00:57:55,957
Haven't I...?

940
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:57,677
You've been busy saving lives.

941
00:57:57,797 --> 00:57:59,397
It's okay, I forgive you.

942
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:02,797
Well... well, we're not in Pakistan anymore.

943
00:58:02,877 --> 00:58:05,837
We're in Cambodia, by the Thai border.

944
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:09,638
You okay?

945
00:58:10,678 --> 00:58:12,198
How's home?

946
00:58:12,278 --> 00:58:13,358
Fine.

947
00:58:13,437 --> 00:58:15,197
Jimmy?

948
00:58:15,277 --> 00:58:16,717
Gorgeous.

949
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:18,477
But bien sur.

950
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:23,918
So, you're in London, and you
called me out of the blue.

951
00:58:23,998 --> 00:58:26,918
Is that because I'm with the
United Nations or just because

952
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:29,238
I'd never forgive you if you didn't?

953
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:30,717
Both.

954
00:58:32,198 --> 00:58:33,278
Tell me.

955
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,478
What do you know about Cambodia?

956
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:39,478
There's a civil war going on,

957
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,679
Communist coalition forces
headed by the Khmer Rouge

958
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,279
versus Communist Vietnamese
running the government.

959
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,518
I believe the British
calls it political irony.

960
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:50,438
Yeah. Well, Nick calls it a clusterfuck.

961
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:51,638
But that's Nick,

962
00:58:51,718 --> 00:58:53,599
not one that minces words.

963
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:55,599
How is he?

964
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:57,319
Is he good?

965
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,679
He's Nick.

966
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:03,318
Was it his idea for you to come here?

967
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:05,679
No. No, both of us.

968
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:08,559
I mean, I... I wanted to see you anyway,

969
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,439
and you know, I always do this...

970
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:14,959
Nick can't pitch to... save his life.

971
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:17,280
Well, you saw that.

972
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,639
Sorry, where, where, where was I?

973
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:20,919
Cambodia.

974
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:22,279
Ah, right.

975
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,719
Well... according to Washington,

976
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,319
the place doesn't officially exist,

977
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:28,720
although there's something
like half a million people

978
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,680
living under Khmer Rouge domination.

979
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,840
Dysentery, measles,

980
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,960
pneumonia, no vaccines, of course,

981
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,719
so death rates run 15 to 20 people a day

982
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,320
in every village, and there's
land mines, lots of them.

983
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,440
So, we have amputees without prosthetics.

984
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,040
It's not a happy place.

985
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,360
So what do you need?

986
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,400
Well, I put together
a shipment of supplies,

987
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,441
vaccines, medicines, the usual.

988
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:55,080
But there's so much corruption
out there, I was wondering,

989
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,160
I mean, the thing would be if...

990
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,760
Elliott, just... just say it.

991
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,401
If we could put a UN stamp on it.

992
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:06,041
I mean, the point is, the UN
name still means something.

993
01:00:06,121 --> 01:00:07,881
You know, just a little bit
of extra protection.

994
01:00:07,961 --> 01:00:09,760
Obviously, I would take
full responsibility.

995
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,480
You just do the paperwork.

996
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:15,161
Well, we do have shipments going
into Thailand and Cambodia.

997
01:00:15,241 --> 01:00:18,721
So, I'll attach your name to the list.

998
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,161
Thank you.

999
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,722
And I'll go with it. I'll see it through.

1000
01:00:22,802 --> 01:00:23,922
Oh, no, you don't need to.

1001
01:00:24,002 --> 01:00:25,561
I know, but I do this now.

1002
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:27,761
Yeah, but Cambodia is different.

1003
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:29,881
I'll see it through.

1004
01:00:52,642 --> 01:00:54,082
So, what is it, what do they want?

1005
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:55,082
Money, Miss Sarah.

1006
01:00:55,162 --> 01:00:57,123
Shit! They see you, they want more.

1007
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:58,443
Always more money, huh?!

1008
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:04,122
I'm not playing their games.
- What?

1009
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,642
I'm not giving them any more money.

1010
01:01:05,682 --> 01:01:06,722
They want their money.

1011
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:08,643
They've already gotten the 10%

1012
01:01:08,683 --> 01:01:10,923
that's written in the contract.
- Contract shit, you pay.

1013
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:14,483
No.
- Miss Sarah.

1014
01:01:14,523 --> 01:01:16,122
I'm not giving them any more money.

1015
01:01:16,202 --> 01:01:17,962
They need more, you pay. You no say no.

1016
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,643
Tell them to get the rest of that shipment

1017
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:21,243
off the boat right now.
- What? Or what?

1018
01:01:21,323 --> 01:01:22,243
What you do?

1019
01:01:22,323 --> 01:01:23,643
This not Chelsea football.

1020
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:24,763
This Cambodia.

1021
01:01:24,923 --> 01:01:26,803
You pay. You pay!

1022
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,284
It's 2 weeks late.

1023
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:46,844
What the hell is going on, Steiger?

1024
01:01:48,563 --> 01:01:49,483
You want a beer?

1025
01:01:49,563 --> 01:01:51,163
I want to know what's going on.

1026
01:01:52,604 --> 01:01:54,564
Crates were late, so...

1027
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:55,564
Shit happens. So what?

1028
01:01:55,644 --> 01:01:56,844
Have you got any idea how fast

1029
01:01:56,924 --> 01:01:58,724
a measles epidemic spreads in 2 weeks?

1030
01:01:58,804 --> 01:02:00,884
I've got enough stains
in my laundry, Callahan.

1031
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:02,684
You're not my only child.

1032
01:02:04,005 --> 01:02:05,644
Just give me the money.

1033
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:12,324
Bringing your titty
from the UN was a smart idea.

1034
01:02:13,844 --> 01:02:16,085
You want to screw? Take your pick.

1035
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:22,084
25 thousand.

1036
01:02:22,164 --> 01:02:24,804
And tell that sorry excuse for a colonel

1037
01:02:24,884 --> 01:02:27,605
that it's 25 more than he deserves.

1038
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:30,645
Mrs. Bauford is waiting.

1039
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:31,645
Listen, you piece of shit.

1040
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:32,805
Fucking with me is one thing,

1041
01:02:32,885 --> 01:02:34,045
but if anything happens to her...

1042
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:35,205
Then what?

1043
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:38,485
Remember, Callahan, I'm the guy
that makes you possible.

1044
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:41,205
You owe me, you took the fucking money,

1045
01:02:41,285 --> 01:02:43,845
now you will do this,
and you will do this right.

1046
01:02:45,445 --> 01:02:48,205
What's the matter? Scared of the dark?

1047
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,286
Now fuck off and save lives.

1048
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:41,607
How'd that happen?

1049
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:43,806
If I can ask.

1050
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,127
Oh.

1051
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:49,007
Before time,

1052
01:03:49,087 --> 01:03:53,007
I was sick, bad lung, TB.

1053
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,688
At this time no doctor where I live.

1054
01:03:55,768 --> 01:03:57,728
Khmer Rouge kill our doctor.

1055
01:03:57,808 --> 01:04:01,607
So, I walk to border for medicine,

1056
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:06,087
but I must cross the mine field first.

1057
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:08,408
You never forget that sound.

1058
01:04:08,488 --> 01:04:10,848
The first thing you hear is click.

1059
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:13,568
It's your foot priming the land mine.

1060
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:15,128
Soon as you hear it,

1061
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,208
it's over.

1062
01:04:18,248 --> 01:04:21,288
But your mind go crazy, you know?

1063
01:04:21,368 --> 01:04:24,208
You thinking, maybe if I jump,

1064
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:28,128
maybe if I find a rock
to match my weight...

1065
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:32,249
But it's nothing you can do.

1066
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:35,288
You hear the click and big bye-bye.

1067
01:04:35,328 --> 01:04:37,008
But,

1068
01:04:37,088 --> 01:04:39,168
I was lucky.

1069
01:04:39,248 --> 01:04:40,769
Just lose my leg.

1070
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:10,169
Any problems?

1071
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:11,849
None.

1072
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:33,490
You're not wearing perfume.

1073
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:51,131
So, are you going to tell me
where we're going?

1074
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:54,491
A place near Pailin,

1075
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:56,530
by the border.

1076
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,011
And the boat's the best way to travel?

1077
01:05:59,091 --> 01:06:01,051
You don't like my boat?

1078
01:06:03,491 --> 01:06:04,971
I think it's very you.

1079
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:08,731
It's safer.

1080
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:11,452
Avoids the road blocks,

1081
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:15,411
the Viet troops,
plus other assorted madness.

1082
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:18,211
You know, heart of darkness.

1083
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:19,451
The horror.

1084
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:23,932
Actually it is.

1085
01:06:24,012 --> 01:06:25,412
Horrible.

1086
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:27,612
And now you're going to tell me why.

1087
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:29,051
Well, Elliott's no good, is he?

1088
01:06:29,131 --> 01:06:31,371
All he gives you is the Buddhist version,

1089
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:32,492
all fucking temples

1090
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:35,852
and gentle people, which is bollocks.

1091
01:06:35,932 --> 01:06:37,012
The Khmer Rouge--

1092
01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:39,332
rouge being very much
the appropriate color--

1093
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,812
used Pailin as a hideout.

1094
01:06:40,892 --> 01:06:43,132
Everyone lives in absolute terror.

1095
01:06:43,172 --> 01:06:45,413
They use the women
as baby-making factories,

1096
01:06:45,492 --> 01:06:46,772
the kids as mine sweepers,

1097
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:48,972
and just in case
we actually help anybody,

1098
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:50,572
they come and steal everything

1099
01:06:50,692 --> 01:06:51,772
that we don't hide.

1100
01:06:51,852 --> 01:06:53,892
So why do they let you stay at all?

1101
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:56,133
They've got no doctors.

1102
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:04,492
I should be singing "Old Man River."

1103
01:07:07,373 --> 01:07:08,533
Please don't.

1104
01:08:09,134 --> 01:08:12,134
Colonel Tao, how are you doing?

1105
01:08:13,175 --> 01:08:15,135
It's good to see you again.

1106
01:08:27,055 --> 01:08:29,135
The boxes, they for who?

1107
01:08:29,215 --> 01:08:31,655
Well, you know who they're for.

1108
01:08:31,735 --> 01:08:32,815
I give you my word.

1109
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,535
This goes only to the women and children.

1110
01:08:40,376 --> 01:08:43,695
Wait, easy, that's medicine,
for Christ's sake!

1111
01:09:03,576 --> 01:09:04,896
I don't understand, what's the problem?

1112
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:10,897
It's a laptop.

1113
01:09:10,937 --> 01:09:12,177
Every NGO has got one.

1114
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:13,817
That's the way we do business here.

1115
01:09:13,897 --> 01:09:15,456
Don't throw those away.

1116
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:18,536
People's lives depend on that,
for fuck's sake!

1117
01:09:24,177 --> 01:09:25,097
Colonel...
- Sarah...

1118
01:09:25,177 --> 01:09:26,097
I'm with UNHCR, United Nations.

1119
01:09:26,177 --> 01:09:27,337
This cargo is protected.

1120
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,257
If this shipment is harmed in any way,

1121
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:30,856
your name will surface
in the follow-up investigation.

1122
01:09:30,936 --> 01:09:31,897
I don't...

1123
01:09:57,978 --> 01:10:00,058
I promise you, I know nothing about this.

1124
01:10:00,138 --> 01:10:01,178
Somebody must have...

1125
01:10:22,538 --> 01:10:24,138
Colonel Tao, you know me.

1126
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:25,338
I swear to God,

1127
01:10:25,378 --> 01:10:26,578
I don't...

1128
01:10:43,059 --> 01:10:45,699
Son of a bitch!

1129
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:01,501
What was that?

1130
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:02,661
You explain it to me.

1131
01:12:02,741 --> 01:12:04,061
I can't explain it to you.

1132
01:12:04,101 --> 01:12:05,061
We were set up.

1133
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:06,261
I knew nothing about that book,

1134
01:12:06,341 --> 01:12:07,701
what was in the box, the equipment...

1135
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,342
Did you know about the guns?

1136
01:12:10,422 --> 01:12:13,022
Did you know about the guns?

1137
01:12:13,102 --> 01:12:14,342
Answer me! Did you know...?

1138
01:12:14,382 --> 01:12:15,542
Yes, I knew about them.

1139
01:12:17,301 --> 01:12:18,781
I came here to help these people,

1140
01:12:18,821 --> 01:12:20,182
and the only way I can do that

1141
01:12:20,262 --> 01:12:21,942
is if I transport guns.
- You don't have

1142
01:12:22,022 --> 01:12:23,182
to transport guns to help people.

1143
01:12:23,262 --> 01:12:24,382
You do here.

1144
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:26,222
Right. So fuck the next person
that tries to bring

1145
01:12:26,302 --> 01:12:27,782
a shipment full of medicine in for people.

1146
01:12:27,862 --> 01:12:29,862
Fuck them.

1147
01:12:29,902 --> 01:12:31,063
As long as you get what you need today,

1148
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:32,223
fuck everybody else!

1149
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:33,422
No one else comes here,

1150
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:34,702
so what do you want me to do?

1151
01:12:34,782 --> 01:12:37,102
You want me to watch
thousands of kids die of measles

1152
01:12:37,142 --> 01:12:38,542
'cause l wouldn't bend the rules?

1153
01:12:38,622 --> 01:12:39,822
Is that a price worth paying?

1154
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,703
Or am I actually killing more than I save?

1155
01:12:41,783 --> 01:12:44,103
You seriously believe that
I don't worry about that?

1156
01:12:44,143 --> 01:12:46,623
That I don't think about that
every minute of every day?

1157
01:12:46,703 --> 01:12:49,022
What's worse? You tell me.

1158
01:12:49,102 --> 01:12:51,142
You tell me what I should do.

1159
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:12,383
What happened?

1160
01:13:32,504 --> 01:13:34,904
Never compromise another organization

1161
01:13:34,984 --> 01:13:37,545
for your own ever again.

1162
01:13:37,665 --> 01:13:40,064
I won't.

1163
01:13:41,144 --> 01:13:42,664
Sarah, you made it.

1164
01:13:42,744 --> 01:13:44,344
Oh, good to see you.

1165
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:47,944
So, I believe congratulations are in order?

1166
01:13:47,984 --> 01:13:49,945
I know, can you believe it?

1167
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:50,945
Oh...

1168
01:13:51,025 --> 01:13:52,665
What the hell happened?

1169
01:13:52,745 --> 01:13:54,905
No guns-- confiscated by Tao.

1170
01:13:54,984 --> 01:13:57,424
He found these intelligence files.

1171
01:13:57,464 --> 01:13:58,984
They freaked him out.

1172
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:00,025
What intelligence files?

1173
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:01,185
Well, how do I know?

1174
01:14:01,265 --> 01:14:02,465
He was tipped off.
He was waiting for us.

1175
01:14:02,545 --> 01:14:04,025
He found these documents.
He went fucking crazy.

1176
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:06,265
Well, if we don't have anything
for the Khmer Rouge,

1177
01:14:06,345 --> 01:14:07,305
we're in deep shit.

1178
01:14:07,345 --> 01:14:08,305
We leave in the morning.

1179
01:14:08,345 --> 01:14:09,385
Take everyone with us.

1180
01:14:09,465 --> 01:14:10,625
No, we need to leave sooner than that.

1181
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:12,505
We've got all this vaccine.
I'm not wasting it.

1182
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,265
We don't have time. We need to go now.

1183
01:14:14,345 --> 01:14:15,505
Not until we vaccinate.

1184
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:17,945
This is not worth risking our lives for.

1185
01:14:19,025 --> 01:14:22,546
You do whatever you got to do.
I'm staying.

1186
01:14:43,266 --> 01:14:44,986
Joss, remember to pack the iodine.

1187
01:14:45,066 --> 01:14:47,306
And the emergency kits-- how many we got?

1188
01:14:47,346 --> 01:14:48,506
Joss?

1189
01:15:02,546 --> 01:15:03,506
No, no. They...

1190
01:15:04,906 --> 01:15:08,827
He says that we're thieves,
that we stole his files

1191
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:11,147
and his guns, and he wants them back.

1192
01:15:11,227 --> 01:15:13,227
Tell him the truth.

1193
01:15:13,307 --> 01:15:14,947
And tell him that we're trying

1194
01:15:15,027 --> 01:15:16,987
to save his bloody people.

1195
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:26,787
He doesn't give a shit about the people.

1196
01:15:26,867 --> 01:15:28,307
He just want the file.

1197
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:29,788
So tell him whatever he wants.

1198
01:15:29,868 --> 01:15:32,468
Just try and buy us some time.

1199
01:15:43,508 --> 01:15:44,468
He wants us to...

1200
01:15:44,588 --> 01:15:45,588
He wants us to what?

1201
01:15:47,268 --> 01:15:49,628
He wants us to make amends now.

1202
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,988
He wants us to go to Pailin.

1203
01:15:52,068 --> 01:15:53,308
You know what that means.

1204
01:15:54,348 --> 01:15:55,268
He say now.

1205
01:15:55,348 --> 01:15:56,268
Okay.

1206
01:15:56,348 --> 01:16:00,068
Tell him that Sarah is from the UN.

1207
01:16:00,148 --> 01:16:02,068
And that the UN is very
important to Big God Ankha,

1208
01:16:02,108 --> 01:16:04,109
and if anything happens to her or to us,

1209
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:05,389
the UN will crucify him.

1210
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:21,749
He say you are a CIA agent
working for Vietnam.

1211
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:25,188
One of you must die.

1212
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:42,029
English doctor, you say
all you care about is my people.

1213
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:20,430
Life mean nothing.

1214
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,631
We serve only Ankha.

1215
01:17:22,711 --> 01:17:24,551
Now you will see.

1216
01:17:24,631 --> 01:17:26,231
For God's sake, he's just a baby.

1217
01:17:33,671 --> 01:17:34,551
Tell them to drop their guns.

1218
01:17:35,831 --> 01:17:37,871
Tell them to drop their fucking weapons now!

1219
01:17:39,191 --> 01:17:40,791
No!

1220
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:42,351
Tell them to back off. Back off!

1221
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:49,151
Tell them to back off.

1222
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:50,151
Tell them to back off.

1223
01:20:04,075 --> 01:20:06,355
Look, as long as we hold due west,

1224
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:07,795
we hit the river.

1225
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,195
That's about 2 miles.

1226
01:20:09,275 --> 01:20:10,596
And the camp's up there.

1227
01:20:10,756 --> 01:20:13,116
About another 3 miles north,
just over the Thai border.

1228
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:15,155
Oh, Jesus.

1229
01:20:15,195 --> 01:20:16,755
Shit. That's Khmer Rouge.

1230
01:20:16,835 --> 01:20:17,995
They've reached the village.

1231
01:20:18,075 --> 01:20:19,835
At this rate, they're going to catch up.

1232
01:20:48,036 --> 01:20:49,796
Keep them moving.

1233
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:51,316
Keep them moving!

1234
01:20:52,636 --> 01:20:54,036
Tell them we're nearly there.

1235
01:20:59,197 --> 01:21:00,557
Sierra Tango 619.

1236
01:21:02,317 --> 01:21:03,877
Sierra Tango 619.

1237
01:21:03,957 --> 01:21:06,637
This is Outpost Grade 7.

1238
01:21:11,317 --> 01:21:13,197
Sierra Tango, come in.

1239
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:31,958
Me father. Me father.

1240
01:21:47,678 --> 01:21:50,879
Look! Look! Helicopter!

1241
01:21:50,959 --> 01:21:52,919
Helicopter!

1242
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:56,478
Helicopter!

1243
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:05,959
Looks Vietnamese, mate.

1244
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:08,879
Good, that will keep them busy.

1245
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,519
Nick?

1246
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,160
It wasn't your fault.

1247
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,600
Yes, it was.

1248
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,160
If I'd have listened to him,

1249
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,001
none of this would have happened.

1250
01:22:58,081 --> 01:23:00,240
I couldn't even bury him properly.

1251
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,160
I didn't even give him
a decent fucking burial.

1252
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,880
Elliott wanted to dedicate his life

1253
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,601
to helping other people.

1254
01:23:08,721 --> 01:23:12,121
And in the end, he died for them.

1255
01:23:12,201 --> 01:23:14,881
Be proud of him.

1256
01:23:14,961 --> 01:23:21,601
Miss him... but be proud of him.

1257
01:23:21,721 --> 01:23:28,281
I don't know what
I'm going to do without him.

1258
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:32,642
I can't stop; I've got to keep going.

1259
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:36,721
There's so much...
- I'm worried about you, here.

1260
01:23:36,801 --> 01:23:40,881
I'm worried that something
is going to happen to you.

1261
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:42,722
Every day for 4 years,

1262
01:23:42,802 --> 01:23:44,882
every morning, I wake up and I wonder

1263
01:23:44,962 --> 01:23:46,562
if you're okay, if you're still alive,

1264
01:23:46,682 --> 01:23:47,762
where you are.

1265
01:24:46,363 --> 01:24:49,564
Shall l ring down for some room service?

1266
01:24:49,604 --> 01:24:53,364
Chocolate cake...

1267
01:24:53,404 --> 01:24:54,964
and some air-conditioning.

1268
01:24:55,044 --> 01:24:57,403
That'd be lovely.

1269
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:06,284
How did you meet Henry?

1270
01:25:06,324 --> 01:25:08,804
I was staring at a Roscoe.

1271
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:11,324
What's that, some sort of dishwasher?

1272
01:25:11,404 --> 01:25:12,884
It was a painting.

1273
01:25:12,924 --> 01:25:15,604
I used to work at an art gallery.

1274
01:25:15,724 --> 01:25:19,004
And one day, Henry came in.

1275
01:25:19,084 --> 01:25:21,564
How old were you?

1276
01:25:21,644 --> 01:25:24,765
Too young.

1277
01:25:24,845 --> 01:25:29,244
But you stayed together?

1278
01:25:29,284 --> 01:25:32,244
Yeah.

1279
01:25:32,284 --> 01:25:35,325
We've both known that
the marriage has been over

1280
01:25:35,405 --> 01:25:36,405
for a long time.

1281
01:25:36,485 --> 01:25:40,285
But we stayed together for Jimmy.

1282
01:25:40,365 --> 01:25:42,685
You love him very much, don't you?

1283
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:45,765
He's amazing.

1284
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:12,006
I'm going to have to start making plans

1285
01:26:12,086 --> 01:26:13,966
to go to New York.

1286
01:26:14,046 --> 01:26:17,766
See Elliott's parents,
tell them what happened.

1287
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:19,046
How long will you be gone?

1288
01:26:19,126 --> 01:26:21,406
I don't know, no idea.

1289
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,966
What is this?

1290
01:26:31,327 --> 01:26:32,847
What are you doing?

1291
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:35,806
I'm absolutely crazy about you.

1292
01:26:35,886 --> 01:26:38,526
I can't stop thinking about you.

1293
01:26:38,606 --> 01:26:40,726
You're always in my mind;
you're in my heart;

1294
01:26:40,806 --> 01:26:43,087
you're in every fucking bit of me.

1295
01:26:43,127 --> 01:26:45,167
But I can't go there with you.

1296
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:46,407
I can't do it.

1297
01:26:46,487 --> 01:26:48,127
Look at what happens to people around me.

1298
01:26:48,207 --> 01:26:49,207
It's not good.

1299
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:50,727
I'm not good for you.
- That's not true.

1300
01:26:50,807 --> 01:26:52,887
Listen, believe me,
if I could live this life again,

1301
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:54,527
I would never leave you for a second.

1302
01:26:54,607 --> 01:26:56,727
But you belong with your family,
and I belong here,

1303
01:26:56,807 --> 01:26:58,727
and there's nothing we can do about it.

1304
01:26:58,807 --> 01:27:00,287
Because whichever way you look at it,

1305
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:01,327
somebody gets hurt.

1306
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:43,688
One, two, three.

1307
01:27:44,248 --> 01:27:45,528
Oh.
- Oops.

1308
01:27:57,688 --> 01:27:58,888
Oh!

1309
01:28:05,609 --> 01:28:09,569
Happy birthday to you

1310
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:13,370
Happy birthday to you

1311
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:17,489
Happy birthday, dear Sarah

1312
01:28:17,569 --> 01:28:22,370
Happy birthday to you.

1313
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:25,850
Thank you.

1314
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:31,009
Thank you, baby.

1315
01:28:31,049 --> 01:28:33,370
Oh, that was lovely.

1316
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:35,890
Lovely playing, lovely cake.

1317
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,010
My playing

1318
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:38,570
was lovelier than his cake.

1319
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:39,610
Mom.

1320
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:41,850
They were both exactly
as lovely as each other.

1321
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:43,730
I think you better blow the candles out

1322
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:44,851
before the cake catches fire.

1323
01:28:44,931 --> 01:28:47,570
Wait until they do you
a candle for each decade, dear.

1324
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,330
Then you'll know you're past it.

1325
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:57,051
Didn't forget to make a wish.

1326
01:28:59,611 --> 01:29:00,771
Got it.

1327
01:29:02,131 --> 01:29:03,171
Oh!

1328
01:29:07,331 --> 01:29:12,291
Mom, when are we going to open the presents?

1329
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:13,611
Now.

1330
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:15,731
Many of you know her from her work

1331
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:17,571
with the Elliott Hauser Foundation

1332
01:29:17,651 --> 01:29:20,051
for the International Promotion
of Human Rights.

1333
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:21,971
In more recent years however,

1334
01:29:22,051 --> 01:29:24,371
she has become an active
lobbyist at Whitehall

1335
01:29:24,411 --> 01:29:28,251
on issues of asylum
and refugee protection.

1336
01:29:28,331 --> 01:29:31,252
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

1337
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:34,212
to introduce our new spokesperson

1338
01:29:34,292 --> 01:29:36,332
for the UNHCR in the United Kingdom,

1339
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:38,891
Mrs. Sarah Bauford.

1340
01:29:51,573 --> 01:29:53,612
Thank you.

1341
01:29:55,212 --> 01:29:57,652
Thank you.

1342
01:29:57,732 --> 01:29:59,092
Ladies and gentlemen,

1343
01:29:59,172 --> 01:30:04,573
I feel very nervous to be
standing in front of you today.

1344
01:30:04,653 --> 01:30:07,493
I also feel very honored.

1345
01:30:07,573 --> 01:30:10,012
In particular, because
UNHCR was the organization

1346
01:30:10,092 --> 01:30:14,853
to which I was first introduced
by my friend Elliott Hauser.

1347
01:30:14,933 --> 01:30:16,413
I know that my being offered this post

1348
01:30:16,493 --> 01:30:18,093
would have given him enormous pleasure.

1349
01:30:18,133 --> 01:30:21,933
Over 50 million people

1350
01:30:21,973 --> 01:30:25,814
are refugees or displaced
persons in the world today.

1351
01:30:25,894 --> 01:30:29,013
And because of closed minds
and funding shortfalls,

1352
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:32,573
we are only able to reach
half of those in need.

1353
01:30:41,414 --> 01:30:44,493
So we rely on our partners,

1354
01:30:44,573 --> 01:30:47,374
the network of aid groups
blazing a trail across crises,

1355
01:30:47,454 --> 01:30:51,174
like El Salvador, Angola,

1356
01:30:51,254 --> 01:30:54,614
Chechnya, Sri Lanka...

1357
01:30:54,694 --> 01:30:58,815
those NGO's, the non-
governmental groups from OXFAM

1358
01:30:58,895 --> 01:31:00,294
right down to the smallest outfits

1359
01:31:00,374 --> 01:31:01,814
run by people like Elliott and...

1360
01:31:09,134 --> 01:31:12,215
...and I pray for those who survive him--

1361
01:31:12,295 --> 01:31:14,135
who continue his work--

1362
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:16,694
without certainty or security--

1363
01:31:16,774 --> 01:31:19,574
wherever they may be in this world.

1364
01:31:22,455 --> 01:31:23,975
Excuse me.

1365
01:31:36,695 --> 01:31:38,135
Hey.

1366
01:31:38,215 --> 01:31:39,455
Hey.

1367
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:40,695
Thanks for coming.

1368
01:31:40,815 --> 01:31:42,455
Listen, I travel thousands of miles

1369
01:31:42,535 --> 01:31:44,096
to hear my sister give a speech,

1370
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:45,576
I got a backache and jet lag.

1371
01:31:45,656 --> 01:31:47,176
What's a taxi ride to the park?

1372
01:31:47,256 --> 01:31:49,335
Sorry. Are they angry?

1373
01:31:49,415 --> 01:31:51,015
No. They don't care, Sarah.

1374
01:31:51,095 --> 01:31:53,095
I think they actually kind of enjoyed it.

1375
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,536
"She's nuts" makes
for much better conversation

1376
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:56,976
than "Nice speech."

1377
01:31:57,016 --> 01:31:59,456
I got a letter from Nick,

1378
01:31:59,536 --> 01:32:02,296
and I think he's in trouble.

1379
01:32:02,376 --> 01:32:04,416
Why? What did he say?

1380
01:32:04,496 --> 01:32:06,656
Nothing, really. Just little things.

1381
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:09,416
Well, where is he?

1382
01:32:09,496 --> 01:32:10,816
He's in Chechnya.

1383
01:32:10,896 --> 01:32:13,136
He's running some sort of camp.

1384
01:32:13,216 --> 01:32:14,696
I'm really not sure.

1385
01:32:16,096 --> 01:32:17,337
I need to find him.

1386
01:32:17,417 --> 01:32:18,897
So, you have contacts.

1387
01:32:18,977 --> 01:32:20,897
You can find out where he is.

1388
01:32:20,977 --> 01:32:22,456
So, please?

1389
01:32:22,536 --> 01:32:24,856
Sarah, sweetheart, you know as well as I do

1390
01:32:24,936 --> 01:32:28,417
that Chechnya is a very dangerous place.

1391
01:32:34,817 --> 01:32:37,537
Yes, I can angle a story there, I'm sure.

1392
01:32:37,617 --> 01:32:41,017
If I find out anything,
I will let you know. Okay?

1393
01:32:42,017 --> 01:32:44,377
Okay. Okay.

1394
01:32:44,457 --> 01:32:45,897
Okay.

1395
01:32:45,937 --> 01:32:47,417
Thank you.

1396
01:32:51,698 --> 01:32:55,657
Perhaps we are all refugees from something,

1397
01:32:55,777 --> 01:32:59,017
but I see now there is nothing to fear;

1398
01:32:59,097 --> 01:33:03,378
that the world we hold on to,
the lives we cherish,

1399
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:08,218
are a part of something greater
--something more.

1400
01:33:08,298 --> 01:33:11,697
When I look at my children,
I see it so clearly--

1401
01:33:11,777 --> 01:33:13,378
that hope--

1402
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:15,898
that chance of life--

1403
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:18,258
and I know it's worth fighting for.

1404
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:22,058
"The wedding was a splendid affair.

1405
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:24,058
"Everyone attended--

1406
01:33:24,139 --> 01:33:26,899
"the dwarves, and the animals of the forest--

1407
01:33:26,979 --> 01:33:28,498
"and there were tears of joy

1408
01:33:28,578 --> 01:33:29,858
"and songs of happiness,

1409
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,698
"and the prince and the princess

1410
01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:35,058
lived happily ever after."

1411
01:33:35,138 --> 01:33:37,699
How does it really end, Mummy?

1412
01:33:37,819 --> 01:33:39,259
What do you mean?

1413
01:33:39,339 --> 01:33:41,459
What do you think happens, honey?

1414
01:33:41,539 --> 01:33:45,298
She wakes up, looks at the prince,

1415
01:33:45,378 --> 01:33:48,659
and goes, "Eww! Boys. Yucky!"

1416
01:33:50,419 --> 01:33:51,859
Hello.

1417
01:33:51,939 --> 01:33:53,859
Hi, Henry. It's Charlotte. Is Sarah there?

1418
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:55,179
Charlotte, hi.

1419
01:33:55,259 --> 01:33:57,379
Uh... well, she's upstairs
with the kids right now.

1420
01:33:57,459 --> 01:33:58,540
Can I take a message?

1421
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:01,299
Oh. Okay. Um...
Then could you just, uh...

1422
01:34:01,379 --> 01:34:04,659
Just let her know that
I will call her later, okay?

1423
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:08,059
Well, I can take a message.

1424
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:12,020
Um... well, then, just tell her
that I've got some news, uh...

1425
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:16,060
and that I will... I will fax it
to her office in the morning.

1426
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:17,379
Okay?

1427
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:18,699
Right. Okay.

1428
01:34:18,779 --> 01:34:20,380
Um... I'll pass that on.

1429
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,220
Okay. Thanks, Henry. Bye, now.

1430
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,780
Bye.

1431
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,420
That was Charlotte.

1432
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:43,301
She said, um... she has some news.

1433
01:34:43,341 --> 01:34:46,701
She'll fax you at the office.

1434
01:36:36,464 --> 01:36:40,544
So this is it, is it?

1435
01:36:40,624 --> 01:36:43,584
You kiss the children good-bye,
scribble a quick note, and then

1436
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:45,104
sneak off into the night.

1437
01:36:45,184 --> 01:36:47,864
Have you any idea
how fucking cruel that is?

1438
01:36:47,944 --> 01:36:49,664
I'm not sneaking off.

1439
01:36:49,784 --> 01:36:52,344
I'm not leaving the children.

1440
01:36:52,424 --> 01:36:54,584
You could have talked to me.

1441
01:36:54,664 --> 01:36:57,425
I mean, writing a note-- it's, uh...

1442
01:36:57,465 --> 01:37:00,065
I just thought it would be easier.

1443
01:37:00,145 --> 01:37:01,425
Than what?

1444
01:37:01,465 --> 01:37:05,024
Than having this conversation again.

1445
01:37:07,784 --> 01:37:09,905
God, this is so...

1446
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:20,185
I should be back by Friday.

1447
01:37:20,265 --> 01:37:22,825
Dinners are in the freezer.

1448
01:37:22,905 --> 01:37:25,265
Their swimsuits are in the dryer.

1449
01:37:25,345 --> 01:37:27,945
They have swimming tomorrow at 4:00.

1450
01:37:28,025 --> 01:37:30,426
It's all in the note.

1451
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:35,306
I want this to be as easy
as possible for them.

1452
01:37:35,386 --> 01:37:37,265
And we'll talk about this.

1453
01:37:37,305 --> 01:37:40,545
We'll talk about everything when I get home.

1454
01:39:05,068 --> 01:39:06,748
Sniper!

1455
01:39:32,028 --> 01:39:34,189
Oh, God...

1456
01:39:37,549 --> 01:39:38,869
This is total carnage,

1457
01:39:38,909 --> 01:39:40,709
and not a single western leader
has said a thing

1458
01:39:40,869 --> 01:39:41,989
about what's going on here.

1459
01:39:42,069 --> 01:39:43,429
There's no threats, no criticism,

1460
01:39:43,509 --> 01:39:44,589
no fucking comment.

1461
01:39:44,669 --> 01:39:46,150
This place might as well not exist.

1462
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:47,709
And now that we're all they have,

1463
01:39:47,829 --> 01:39:49,509
they want us to save face for them.

1464
01:39:49,589 --> 01:39:51,989
Well, fuck that. They should
get off their fucking asses

1465
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:53,869
and get the fuck out here. Shit.

1466
01:39:53,949 --> 01:39:55,429
Sorry. I'm still swearing.

1467
01:39:55,469 --> 01:39:56,910
Freeze it there.

1468
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:59,110
Can we cut?

1469
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:08,750
Okay.

1470
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,150
Roll tape.

1471
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:16,110
Basically, nothing has changed.

1472
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:18,270
People keep saying that
everything has changed.

1473
01:40:18,351 --> 01:40:19,591
Not from where I'm standing.

1474
01:40:19,671 --> 01:40:20,950
Chechnya, Somalia, Cambodia,

1475
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:23,350
Ethiopia-- it's the same shit every time,

1476
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:25,710
and it's just going to go on
and on until we stop pretending

1477
01:40:25,790 --> 01:40:27,230
that our loyalty ends with the asshole...

1478
01:40:50,831 --> 01:40:53,112
You okay?

1479
01:40:53,192 --> 01:40:54,831
What do you know?

1480
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:57,191
An English news crew filmed it 6 days ago.

1481
01:40:57,231 --> 01:40:59,831
The sound man is dead,
the cameraman is in a coma,

1482
01:40:59,911 --> 01:41:01,191
and Nick has disappeared.

1483
01:41:01,271 --> 01:41:02,991
We think it's bandits--

1484
01:41:03,072 --> 01:41:05,192
Chechens looking for money--

1485
01:41:05,272 --> 01:41:07,312
but there's been no ransom demand.

1486
01:41:10,671 --> 01:41:12,911
Sarah, I want you to meet Bob Strauss.

1487
01:41:12,951 --> 01:41:14,392
He's with the ICRC here.

1488
01:41:14,472 --> 01:41:15,992
He's been helping us.

1489
01:41:18,392 --> 01:41:19,632
Hi.

1490
01:41:19,712 --> 01:41:21,152
No, sit. Sit, please.

1491
01:41:25,392 --> 01:41:27,392
So, the, um... net result right now

1492
01:41:27,432 --> 01:41:29,192
is we don't know who took Nick.

1493
01:41:29,272 --> 01:41:30,992
We don't know if he pissed off

1494
01:41:31,072 --> 01:41:32,672
the Russians or the Chechens.

1495
01:41:32,752 --> 01:41:34,872
We're pretty sure there was a motive.

1496
01:41:34,952 --> 01:41:36,032
What was he doing?

1497
01:41:36,112 --> 01:41:37,073
I think you know

1498
01:41:37,153 --> 01:41:39,353
he wasn't just a doctor anymore.

1499
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:41,313
He, uh... I'd have to say--

1500
01:41:41,353 --> 01:41:43,073
and this is well known--

1501
01:41:43,153 --> 01:41:45,552
Nick's activities went quite a way

1502
01:41:45,592 --> 01:41:47,112
beyond what you'd call famine relief.

1503
01:41:47,152 --> 01:41:48,113
How do we find him?

1504
01:41:48,193 --> 01:41:51,153
Well, nobody I've spoken to

1505
01:41:51,233 --> 01:41:53,313
has any leads yet.

1506
01:41:53,393 --> 01:41:55,393
Can we offer a reward?

1507
01:41:57,153 --> 01:42:00,753
Can... can... can we do something?

1508
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:03,273
The best thing for you to do is to stay

1509
01:42:03,353 --> 01:42:05,553
in the hotel for
a couple of days. Be patient.

1510
01:42:05,633 --> 01:42:07,473
No. No.

1511
01:42:07,513 --> 01:42:09,273
No.

1512
01:42:09,353 --> 01:42:10,834
Sarah.

1513
01:42:12,194 --> 01:42:14,434
Sarah, listen to me.

1514
01:42:14,514 --> 01:42:16,114
This place, they will take journalists,

1515
01:42:16,194 --> 01:42:17,633
Red Cross, anybody.

1516
01:42:17,713 --> 01:42:19,633
Don't think for one second
that you are immune.

1517
01:42:19,713 --> 01:42:21,153
I don't.

1518
01:42:21,193 --> 01:42:22,994
Just listen to what Strauss said.

1519
01:42:23,074 --> 01:42:24,754
I don't care what Strauss said.

1520
01:42:24,874 --> 01:42:26,634
Sarah, I love you.

1521
01:42:26,714 --> 01:42:28,994
I want you to be safe. Go home.

1522
01:42:29,034 --> 01:42:31,594
I swear to God, I will let you
know if we hear anything.

1523
01:42:31,674 --> 01:42:32,635
Say it.

1524
01:42:32,675 --> 01:42:33,634
What?

1525
01:42:33,674 --> 01:42:34,754
Say it.

1526
01:42:37,554 --> 01:42:40,474
People disappear here;
they don't come back.

1527
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:44,115
I'm not leaving until I find him.

1528
01:42:48,355 --> 01:42:49,794
Okay.

1529
01:43:15,955 --> 01:43:17,516
Charley?

1530
01:43:19,596 --> 01:43:21,356
Who is it?

1531
01:43:30,196 --> 01:43:31,516
Mrs. Bauford?

1532
01:43:31,596 --> 01:43:33,036
My name is Jan Steiger.

1533
01:43:33,076 --> 01:43:34,556
I'm a friend of Nick's.

1534
01:43:34,636 --> 01:43:37,036
May I?

1535
01:43:40,116 --> 01:43:41,556
We work together.

1536
01:43:41,636 --> 01:43:43,396
On and off.

1537
01:43:45,676 --> 01:43:47,716
You should move your bed.

1538
01:43:47,876 --> 01:43:49,356
It's too near the window.

1539
01:43:49,436 --> 01:43:51,717
Were you working together here?

1540
01:43:51,797 --> 01:43:54,557
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

1541
01:43:54,637 --> 01:43:55,916
How'd you know where I was?

1542
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:57,356
My sister?

1543
01:43:57,396 --> 01:44:00,196
Oh, no, I'm not a journalist, Mrs. Bauford.

1544
01:44:00,236 --> 01:44:01,836
I'm more import/export.

1545
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:05,237
Cambodia, we nearly met.

1546
01:44:06,677 --> 01:44:07,677
Actually,

1547
01:44:07,757 --> 01:44:09,677
Nick mentioned you a few times.

1548
01:44:09,757 --> 01:44:11,557
I most certainly would have.

1549
01:44:11,637 --> 01:44:12,916
What do you want?

1550
01:44:12,996 --> 01:44:15,477
What do you want, Mrs. Bauford?

1551
01:44:15,557 --> 01:44:16,917
I want to know where Nick is.

1552
01:44:16,997 --> 01:44:18,917
Last I heard,

1553
01:44:18,957 --> 01:44:20,637
he was being held in the mountains--

1554
01:44:20,717 --> 01:44:21,917
a rebel position,

1555
01:44:21,957 --> 01:44:23,757
about 5, 6 miles northeast of here.

1556
01:44:23,837 --> 01:44:25,878
Whole area's under heavy
Russian shelling now,

1557
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:27,798
but I managed to make radio contact.

1558
01:44:27,878 --> 01:44:30,397
They were negotiating, they knew who he was.

1559
01:44:32,717 --> 01:44:35,717
But that was yesterday, been nothing since.

1560
01:44:35,758 --> 01:44:38,918
Chances are that he's dead.

1561
01:44:41,078 --> 01:44:42,478
So why are you telling me this?

1562
01:44:42,558 --> 01:44:44,997
I'm curious.

1563
01:44:45,077 --> 01:44:47,998
I mean, you come to this shit-hole in hell,

1564
01:44:48,078 --> 01:44:51,438
and you think you can find him?

1565
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:53,518
What is it?

1566
01:44:53,598 --> 01:44:54,998
Is this... love?

1567
01:44:55,078 --> 01:44:56,438
Is that what it is?

1568
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:01,638
Okay, whatever.

1569
01:45:01,678 --> 01:45:03,838
You're here.

1570
01:45:03,918 --> 01:45:05,398
Now...

1571
01:45:05,478 --> 01:45:07,438
if I get him back alive.

1572
01:45:07,478 --> 01:45:09,919
I'll lose one less operative.

1573
01:45:09,999 --> 01:45:13,319
If he's dead, he's dead.

1574
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:16,719
Of course I'm not stupid enough
to risk my own ass

1575
01:45:16,799 --> 01:45:18,758
for some fucked-up big mouth.

1576
01:45:18,878 --> 01:45:23,719
But you, you're willing
to risk your life for love.

1577
01:45:26,679 --> 01:45:29,199
I'll trade with anything, Mrs. Bauford.

1578
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:31,159
Anything at all.

1579
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,159
Fine.

1580
01:45:35,239 --> 01:45:38,759
What do I do?

1581
01:45:38,839 --> 01:45:41,319
I have a friend, a local.

1582
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:44,120
He can get you into the mountains,

1583
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:47,320
but after that, I'm just a spectator.

1584
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,879
Love.

1585
01:47:12,923 --> 01:47:14,602
I'm looking for Nick Callahan,

1586
01:47:14,682 --> 01:47:17,082
the English doctor.

1587
01:47:52,963 --> 01:47:54,403
Come.

1588
01:47:57,644 --> 01:47:59,564
Five minutes.

1589
01:48:21,044 --> 01:48:22,484
Nick?

1590
01:48:24,964 --> 01:48:26,124
Nick, it's Sarah.

1591
01:48:38,484 --> 01:48:39,804
I'm going to get you out of here.

1592
01:48:39,884 --> 01:48:41,484
We're going to get out of here right now.

1593
01:48:44,605 --> 01:48:46,605
There's a Red Cross camp on the border.

1594
01:48:46,685 --> 01:48:48,045
It's about 4 miles west of here.

1595
01:48:48,125 --> 01:48:49,085
We can walk it.

1596
01:48:50,125 --> 01:48:51,285
Damn it!

1597
01:48:51,365 --> 01:48:52,924
Come on, get up. Get up!

1598
01:48:52,964 --> 01:48:54,205
Nick, get up!

1599
01:49:25,845 --> 01:49:30,206
Nick? Remember?

1600
01:49:30,246 --> 01:49:32,166
Remember I wrote to you?

1601
01:49:32,246 --> 01:49:34,206
And I told you

1602
01:49:34,286 --> 01:49:36,486
you have a daughter.

1603
01:49:36,566 --> 01:49:40,807
Anna. You remember?

1604
01:49:40,887 --> 01:49:43,646
You're a dad.

1605
01:49:43,726 --> 01:49:47,606
And she needs you.

1606
01:49:47,686 --> 01:49:53,367
She needs you to get up
and walk out of here.

1607
01:49:53,407 --> 01:49:55,167
So get up.

1608
01:49:55,247 --> 01:49:57,087
Get up, Nick.

1609
01:50:26,648 --> 01:50:28,328
That was close.

1610
01:51:07,328 --> 01:51:08,969
What?

1611
01:51:09,049 --> 01:51:10,929
We need a lot of money to do...

1612
01:51:11,009 --> 01:51:13,329
It won't be hard to track us.

1613
01:53:07,292 --> 01:53:08,852
I can't make it-- go!
- You can...

1614
01:53:08,892 --> 01:53:10,612
Go, you've got to go. Listen to me.

1615
01:53:10,692 --> 01:53:11,973
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1616
01:53:12,053 --> 01:53:13,173
They're not going to kill me.

1617
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:15,253
They're not going to kill me.
They need me alive.

1618
01:53:15,333 --> 01:53:16,293
I'm worth money to them.

1619
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:18,172
If they get you,

1620
01:53:18,252 --> 01:53:20,052
they will rape you, they will kill you.

1621
01:53:20,132 --> 01:53:22,333
Y-You've got to go and get help.

1622
01:53:25,493 --> 01:53:27,733
Okay. Okay.

1623
01:54:28,014 --> 01:54:29,815
Sarah!

1624
01:54:32,015 --> 01:54:35,135
Sarah, go!

1625
01:54:35,215 --> 01:54:37,255
Go! You can make it.

1626
01:54:39,614 --> 01:54:41,775
Go!

1627
01:54:41,855 --> 01:54:43,375
What are you...

1628
01:54:43,455 --> 01:54:45,255
What are you doing?!

1629
01:54:45,335 --> 01:54:46,935
For God's...

1630
01:54:47,015 --> 01:54:50,815
Sarah, please!

1631
01:54:50,935 --> 01:54:52,416
Stay. Stay.

1632
01:54:52,496 --> 01:54:54,696
Go!

1633
01:55:58,457 --> 01:56:01,818
I hope when you're reading this letter,

1634
01:56:01,858 --> 01:56:04,697
that I'm sitting there next to you

1635
01:56:04,777 --> 01:56:07,817
and you're telling me
that I'm stupid for writing it,

1636
01:56:07,977 --> 01:56:11,058
and crazy for trying to find you.

1637
01:56:11,098 --> 01:56:13,858
But how could I not?

1638
01:56:13,978 --> 01:56:16,098
It's you.

1639
01:56:16,138 --> 01:56:20,697
All this time, so many years apart...

1640
01:56:20,777 --> 01:56:23,698
I've missed you,

1641
01:56:23,778 --> 01:56:27,778
but I have never been without you.

1642
01:56:27,858 --> 01:56:31,738
I've woken up with you every morning

1643
01:56:31,818 --> 01:56:34,419
and gone to sleep with you every night.

1644
01:56:34,459 --> 01:56:37,178
You have always been with me.

1645
01:56:37,258 --> 01:56:40,658
Your courage, your smile...

1646
01:56:40,738 --> 01:56:43,699
your damn stubbornness.

1647
01:56:43,779 --> 01:56:47,739
There has never been
any distance between us,

1648
01:56:47,819 --> 01:56:50,699
and there never will be.

1649
01:56:52,538 --> 01:56:54,498
I love you, Nick.

1650
01:56:54,579 --> 01:56:57,179
I love you.
