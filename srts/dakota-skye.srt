HEATHER: Hey, kids.
You're eating with us tonight?

355
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:27,319
Yeah, I want hash browns.

356
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,360
And a chocolate shake.

357
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:32,658
And how about you, special guy?
Chili cheeseburger? Vanilla Coke?

358
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,563
- Uh, yeah.
- HEATHER: Amazing.

359
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,826
- De Niro?
- Biscuits and gravy.

360
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:42,799
- Can I get a fill-up on the coffee?
- Absolutely. Be right back.

Smoked a little pot, went to Noel's,
played some video games, whatever.

Why?

00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,142
'Cause I was over
at Bobby and Noel's,

412

be described as epic,

00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,012
They said that they knew that, though,
that they thought that it was gross

It's not entertainment.

It's functional?

00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:26,994
Yeah, porn has a singular purpose
in its existence.

422
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:30,694
It's a tool, an aid, a catalyst
in the act of pleasuring yourself.

One time me and Kev came up here
after school, and we fell asleep,

That's it?

00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:38,601

It was good.

00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,249
Yeah, it's really good.

500
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,294
It was good the first time I heard it.
It was good the hundredth.

501
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:07,791
He's really proud of it.

502
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:11,130
Almost makes me sorry
I quit our old band.

503
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:24,076
How far down do you think that is?

504
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,949
I don't know.

505
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:29,918
Far.

506
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:32,856
Huh.

507
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:35,488
What?

508
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,529
Okay. All right.

509
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:44,898
Imagine you threw yourself
from here, all right?

510
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:48,200

Yeah, whatever.

514
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:56,140
So, imagine you take it
upon yourself to jump.

516
00:33:57,782 --> 00:34:02,481

would you rather be facing?

00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,315
You're a weird guy.

518
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,248
I get that.

519
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,796
No, but really, I mean, would you

00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:24,041
I don't know.
This is pretty bad.

694
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:27,914
- This is so bad.
- Yeah.

695
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:31,785
- I just feel like--
- I know.

696
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:36,025
Hey, how about this?

697
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:40,290
How about let's just pretend
like this is all a dream, okay?

698
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:41,056
Okay.

699
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,463
And nothing that we say or do
counts in the waking world,

700
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,832
and out there, I mean,
we might be horrible people,

701
00:48:46,937 --> 00:48:54,434
but right here in our dream,
you and me, this is all okay.

702
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:58,537
- Just for today.
- Just for right here and right now.

703
00:48:59,683 --> 00:49:02,049
You know, eventually we're gonna
have to wake up from this dream.

704
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:04,585
Yeah, but not right now.

705
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:14,696
Not for a little while, anyway.

706
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:51,183
<i>So, I think I'm falling in love. </i>

707
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:53,786
<i>involuntarily blessed with something</i>

708
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:58,334
<i>people spend their entire lives
searching for. </i>

709
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:01,699
<i>Lucky me. </i>

710
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:09,236
Are you tired?

711
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:12,443
Tell me again why you don't drive.

712
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:15,416
Uh, I don't have a license.

713
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,009
Why not?

714
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:20,750
Because I always had a ride.

715
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:23,983
<i>And you don't have
a cell phone because...?</i>

716
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:25,652
Somebody might call it.

717
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:35,095
You know, something
just occurred to me.

718
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:38,604
We've been gone almost 2 4 hours.
Aren't your parents gonna freak?

719
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,405
My mom's out of town.

720
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:44,481
And your dad?

721
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:51,009
<i>My dad died when I was little, so. . .
I think we're in the clear. </i>

722
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,451
JONAH:
I'm sorry.

723
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:56,526
It's okay.

724
00:51:56,627 --> 00:51:59,619
It's cancer. It happens.

725
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:01,598
I guess--

726
00:52:01,698 --> 00:52:03,393
If you say "I guess
that explains a few things",

727
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,128
you lose a testicle.

728
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:07,433
I wasn't gonna say--

729
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:10,371
I don't date older guys
looking for Daddy.

730
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:12,669
I don't. I'm not looking
for a father figure.

731
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:16,371
I have a dad.
He's just not here anymore.

732
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:19,281
That would have really
put me in my place

733
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:22,113
if I would have said anything.

734
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:25,786
<i>I'm sorry. I just...</i>

735
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,190
<i>Kevin just always...</i>

736
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:33,526
Never mind.

737

[Door opens, closes]

740
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:58,512
Told you.

741
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:07,221
- You want the tour?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

742
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:16,462
<i>Kitchen, dining room,
den, living room...</i>

743
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,302
Hold on. Follow me.

744
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,841
Hallway.

745
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:30,011
Oh, goodness! My room!
How did we get in here?

746
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:13,888
Do we have to wake up yet?

747
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:50,022
JONAH: I can't do this.
DAKOTA: But we already are.

748
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,998
We can't.

749
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:57,638
- I know, but I want to.
- Oh, God. So do I.

750
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:02,737
- We can't.
- We can't.

751

<i>KEVIN: Hey, where
have you been all day?</i>

755
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,171
I've been studying at Denise's.

00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:34,970
You comin'?

757
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:36,444

Oh, yeah! Of course!

760
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,508
Fuck, yeah, of course.
Can you do me a favor?

761
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:43,518
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- Do you have Jonah's number?</i>

762
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,815
Yeah, yeah. I got it somewhere.

763
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:48,390
<i>All right, well, could you
give him a call for me, then?</i>

764
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:49,481
Okay.

765
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,786
All right. Cool. Well, hook up
a ride with him to get here,

766
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:53,988
- because I'm already at the show.
- Okay. Bye.

never heard before,

- Coffee.

Coffee.

854
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:41,063
Well, damn. I'll get a chili
cheeseburger and a vanilla Coke.

- Yeah. You rocked the house, dude.

861
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:57,716
Yeah, make you sorry
that you quit the old band?

Oh, hell no! Don't believe
this motherfucker for a second!

863
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,750
You didn't quit the band! We kicked
him out because he sucked!

01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,724
Bad?

865
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:07,922
Bad? On a scale of 1 to 10,
he was, like, negative 142.

I thought you said
you quit the band.

867
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:15,994
KEVIN: Hey, yo, Terry!

868
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:18,768
What kind of douche-bags
come to Jim's at 2:00 in the morning?

869
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,867
This some S.A.T. study group?

870
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:23,810
Nerd.

871
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:34,415
- TERRY: Later, guys.
- KEVIN: Have a good night, Terry.

872
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:36,492
JONAH: Later.
'Kota, do you need a lift?

873
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:38,652
KEVIN: No, I'll take her, man.

874
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:41,787
BETH: Um, could I get a ride home?

875
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:45,693
JONAH: Uh, yeah.

876
01:03:46,236 --> 01:03:48,704
BETH: 'Night, guys.

877
01:03:58,248 --> 01:04:00,478
- KEVIN: Can I come inside?
- DAKOTA: No, not tonight.

878
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,780
<i>- Why? Your mom home?
- Yeah. No. I mean...</i>

879
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:07,220
- Then, what?
- I have school in the morning!

880
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:08,255
Oh, come on.

881
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:11,691
I'm still so amped up
from the show, from the concert.

882
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,997
Come on!

883
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:18,225
Don't you want to fuck a rock star?

884
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:36,517
Yeah. I hit that shit last night.

885
01:04:39,455 --> 01:04:41,047
Like I fucking care

886
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:43,955
if I pass that stupid class.

887
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,427
Just stayed home

888
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:50,897
and played video games.

889
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:54,502
Right now I'm really just trying

890
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:57,539
to concentrate on my work.

891
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:05,374
<i>Same as ever. I don't get It. </i>

892
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:14,179
<i>He didnt quit the band.
They kicked him out. </i>

893
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:17,259
<i>Why didnt I know that?</i>

894
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:20,829
<i>I have to do something about this.
I can't tell when he's lying. </i>

895
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,457
<i>He could have been lying
this whole time. </i>

896
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:30,595
Hey, Chris. It's Chris, right?

897
01:05:30,707 --> 01:05:32,937
Okay.

898
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:35,177
<i>So, I've been poring
over these things all night,</i>

899
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:37,246
<i>and I've learned 2 things. </i>

900
01:05:37,347 --> 01:05:39,815
<i>1, despite all non-scientific knowledge,</i>

901
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,884
<i>an intense dose of radiation
won't kill you. </i>

902
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:44,715
<i>It'll just make you big
and green and cranky. </i>

903
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:48,222
<i>And 2, every superhero
has a weakness,</i>

904
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:51,225
<i>something that brings them down
with the rest of the mortals. </i>

905
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:52,157
<i>Maybe that's it!</i>

906
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:54,594
<i>Maybe Jonah is my archenemy,</i>

907
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:57,996
<i>the one being out there
that can nullify my superpower. </i>

908
01:05:58,101 --> 01:06:00,729
<i>Has our heroine
finally met her match?</i>

909
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:01,531
<i>Find out next month In-- </i>

910
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:05,096
[Telephone rings]

911
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,142
[Sighs]

912
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:10,612
Hello.

913
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:24,786
Take that, bitches!

914
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:25,883
What's my score?

915
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:27,462
DAKOTA: 140.

916
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:28,928
And what's yours?

917
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:30,363
DAKOTA: 56.

918
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,934
God, you suck!

919
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:36,701
Bowling's my favorite nonport.

920
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,074
So, are we gonna
do this all night or what?

921
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:45,313
Do what? Bowl?

922
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:51,376
Not talk about this.
About the other night.

923
01:06:51,487 --> 01:06:53,478
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

924
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:56,581
Yes, we're gonna
not talk about this all night.

925
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:00,788
I think I'm in love with you.

926
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,930
- What?!
- No, fuck that.

927
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:06,832
I'm absolutely, positively
in love with you.

928
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,941
I said I love you.

929
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:17,205
How do I know?

930
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:24,443
- Well, for starters, I just told you.
- Yeah, but how do I know?

931
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,858
I guess you're just gonna
have to trust me.

932
01:07:30,426 --> 01:07:36,524
You see, that's it. I don't know
how to do that, trust you.

933
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,567
Excuse me?

934
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:41,169
Ugh.

935
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:47,607
I don't know how to do that.
That's the problem.

936
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:51,103
I guess I thought
that I would have earned it by now.

937
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,406
Don't you see?
That's the problem.

938
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:53,982
<i>I...</i>

939
01:07:57,687 --> 01:08:00,281
How do I know?

940
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:07,227
It's really hard to explain.

941
01:08:08,598 --> 01:08:10,725
It's not that hard.

942
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:14,202
[Sighs]

943
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:23,434
Fucking hell.

944
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,893
I've known him since I was 9.

945
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:51,528
He used to steal the lunch money
from the kids who stole mine,

946
01:08:51,641 --> 01:08:54,667
and we'd go buy fireworks.

947
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:57,775
First car I ever drove was his.

948
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,244
Lit my first cigarette.

949
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:06,086
Had a lot of firsts with him.

950
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:11,791
<i>Now, it's the first time I've ever
tried to steal anyone's girlfriend, so...</i>

951
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:16,524
<i>...guess it fits
that I go through that with him, too. </i>

952
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:28,206
Do you love him?

953
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:31,979
I don't know.

954
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:39,216
Do you love me?

955
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:42,588
If I knew the answer to that,

956
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:46,150
I'd probably know the answer
to the other.

957
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:54,436
You're right not to trust me. Look
what I'm doing to my best friend.

958
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:58,735
- It's not that I don't trust you, it's just--
- No, no. It's cool.

959
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:02,808
I understand.

960
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:08,073
Let's go.

961
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:13,015
- Where are we going?
- Home. It's late.

962
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:29,863
Aristocrat is to imperious
as Supplicant is to:

963
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:34,271
Cowardly, Awkward,
Servile, or Arrogant?

964
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,570
Give me the choices
one more time.

965
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:42,675
Cowardly, Awkward,
Servile, or Arrogant?

966
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:46,216
Servile?

967
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:47,448
- Very good!
- Fuck, yeah!

968
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:53,120
Bring on the bull-shit, S.A.T.'s!
I'm-a fuck them up!

969
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:56,965
<i>So...</i>

970
01:10:58,067 --> 01:11:00,433
<i>...how's Jonah?</i>

971
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:03,400
I don't know.
You'd have to ask him.

972
01:11:03,573 --> 01:11:05,438
Uh-huh.

973
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,604
- What?
- Nothing.

974
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:14,713
Let's trade secrets.

975
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:16,383
No.

976
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:18,453
I'll tell you a secret,
then you tell me one.

977
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:20,146
- No.
- Come on. It will be fun.

978
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:22,952
Like we're at a slumber party.

979
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:27,355
Okay. I'll go first.

980
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:34,525
Bookstores make me
have to go shit.

981
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:37,935
- What?!
- Yeah, I don't know what it is.

982
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,736
I can't be in a bookstore
for more than, like, 15 minutes

983
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:42,276
before I have to go.

984
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:44,606
- That's disgusting!
- Oh, come on!

985
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:48,172
Maybe it's some repressed
Barnes & Noble trauma

986
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:51,515
deep in my childhood,
but it happens without fail.

987
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:56,147
- I sit next to you in English!
- Okay. Your turn.

988
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:57,414
No!

989
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,425
Come on! That was
really embarrassing!

990
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,052
You have to give me something.

991
01:12:01,163 --> 01:12:02,994
Dude, that is your own
damn problem.

992
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:06,262
One of many, it seems.

993
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:13,737
I know about you and Jonah.

994
01:12:15,645 --> 01:12:17,840
What about me and Jonah?

995
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:21,314
That you were together all day
Sunday and then lied about it.

996
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:22,748
Bookstores?

997
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:26,344
Seriously, I was joking about that.

998
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:30,414
I'm perceptive, you know?

999
01:12:30,526 --> 01:12:33,393
I can tell when people are lying.

1000
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:36,924
<i>Come on. Let me just...</i>

1001
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,994
<i>be your friend for once. </i>

1002
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:43,370
I'd really like to.

1003
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:57,515
He likes me, and I like him.

1004
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,115
More than Kevin?

1005
01:13:00,856 --> 01:13:03,416
Different than Kevin.

1006
01:13:03,526 --> 01:13:08,520
I understand. Jonah is a good guy.

1007
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,565
<i>Have you guys...?</i>

1008
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,032
No.

1009
01:13:16,072 --> 01:13:17,767
Kind of.

1010
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:20,671
Almost.

1011
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,568
But it doesn't matter,

1012
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:25,408
because all I have to do
is wait a few more days, right,

1013
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:28,972
and then he'll be gone,
and then the decision makes itself.

1014
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:31,815
Only if you let it.

1015
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:34,890
- You want to know what I think?
- No, not really.

1016
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,823
You need to make
that decision for yourself.

1017
01:13:38,094 --> 01:13:42,861
Don't take the easy way out,
or you'll regret it.

1018
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,464
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
end up regretting something

1019
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:49,470
when this is over,
no matter what I do.

1020
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:57,679
<i>The only thing that bugs me more
than when Beth shares secrets</i>

1021
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,613
<i>Is when Beth is right. </i>

1022
01:14:01,617 --> 01:14:04,347
<i>This is a decision
I have to come to myself. </i>

1023
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:08,822
<i>I can't just ride this out
and accept the default answer. </i>

1024
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:12,219
<i>Predictable
doesn't always mean boring. </i>

1025
01:14:12,394 --> 01:14:14,862
<i>Lust doesn't always mean love. </i>

1026
01:14:14,964 --> 01:14:18,456
<i>Near doesn't always mean close. </i>

1027
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,607
<i>New doesn't always mean exciting. </i>

1028
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:29,677
<i>Different doesn't always mean better. </i>

1029
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:32,714
<i>Far doesn't always mean distant. </i>

1030
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:36,050
<i>Knowing everything
doesn't make you wise. </i>

1031
01:14:36,152 --> 01:14:39,178
<i>Knowing the truth
doesn't make you superior. </i>

1032
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:43,748
<i>Knowing your problem
doesn't solve It. </i>

1033
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,851
<i>Sitting between
your past and your future</i>

1034
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:52,457
<i>doesn't mean you're in the present. </i>

1035
01:14:55,638 --> 01:14:57,606
What did you think?

1036
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,674
Sucks.

1037
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:01,367
Yeah.

1038
01:15:03,813 --> 01:15:06,941
I'm leaving. Going home.

1039
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:10,110
- When?
- Now.

1040
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:11,982
What do you mean, "now"?

1041
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:15,817
Now, like this minute.
I can't be here.

1042
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:19,423
Please don't go.
I don't want you to.

1043
01:15:19,595 --> 01:15:22,189
Yeah. I know.
That makes two of us.

1044
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:23,492
But I think you're
trying to make a decision,

1045
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:25,499
and I'm gonna make it easier on you.

1046
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:29,059
I'm eliminating myself as a choice.

1047
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:34,742
So, a great fucking movie, or what?

1048
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:35,776
It sucked!

1049
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:37,038
What the fuck?
Are you deaf, dumb, and blind?

1050
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:39,046
That movie was amazing, dude!

1051
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:42,481
Kev, I'm gonna
head out of town tonight.

1052
01:15:42,585 --> 01:15:43,882
What the fuck? Why?

1053
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:47,149
I got to get back-tuff to do.

1054
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,380
Why didn't you say
some shit earlier, dude?

1055
01:15:49,558 --> 01:15:50,786
We could have planned
a party or something.

1056
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,927
I know. It's cool.

1057
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:53,858
I'm with the only people
I want to see.

1058
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,130
Dude. All right, bro.

1059
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:00,333
KEVIN: Well, good seeing you, man.
JONAH: You too.

1060
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:01,403
I love you, bro.

1061
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:05,702
- You too.
- All right.

1062
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:09,839
- Bye.
- Bye.

1063
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:14,575
[Quietly] I'm sorry for coming in
and fucking up your life.

1064
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:23,686
See you later, kids.

1065
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:29,758
Well, I guess I know where you'll be
if we ever break up.

1066
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:32,060
- What?
- "What?"

1067
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:33,099
A couple more seconds in that hug,

1068
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:36,069
and I'd have to fucking
drop-kick his ass.

1069
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:38,966
DAKOTA:
You're stupid. Shut up.

1070
01:16:39,074 --> 01:16:41,838
You know, he's a really good guy.

1071
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:44,378
I like him.

1072
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:46,977
Me, too.

1073
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:52,179
Come on. Let's go.

1074
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:06,993
Did you notice something funny
about Jonah tonight?

1075
01:17:08,938 --> 01:17:10,200
Like how?

1076
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:15,107
<i>I don't know.
Like, he looked all, like...sad. </i>

1077
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:20,381
- Yeah, I suppose he did.
- Yeah.

1078
01:17:21,784 --> 01:17:24,947
I haven't seen that look on his face
since we asked him to quit the band.

1079
01:17:25,421 --> 01:17:27,082
I thought that you kicked him out.

1080
01:17:28,624 --> 01:17:32,082
Kicked him out, asked him to quit.
Same thing. Whatever.

1081
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:36,593
<i>DAKOTA THINKING:
Same thing. Whatever. </i>

1082
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:40,161
Want to go bowling?

1083
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:43,930
Not really.

1084
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,302
[Clears throat]

1085
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:51,644
Want to go back to your place?

1086
01:17:52,848 --> 01:17:54,873
My mom came home today.

1087
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:03,948
<i>DAKOTA THINKING:
Same thing. Whatever. </i>

1088
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:05,919
What?

1089
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,637
<i>I know that I have to
make a choice,</i>

1090
01:18:21,744 --> 01:18:24,941
<i>regret it or not. </i>

1091
01:18:25,114 --> 01:18:28,481
<i>I choose to be alone. </i>

1092
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:32,376
<i>I choose to jump face-first,</i>

1093
01:18:32,488 --> 01:18:36,481
<i>to not just kick back
and enjoy the ride. </i>

1094
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:43,464
<i>I choose nether my future
nor my past, but my present, my now. </i>

1095
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:16,920
<i>So, it turns out senior year sucked
a little bit less than junior year,</i>

1096
01:19:17,032 --> 01:19:20,468
<i>and Beth is still, well, Beth,</i>

1097
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:22,695
<i>still obsessed with college
and careers and all that shit,</i>

1098
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:25,171
<i>but we're friends again,</i>

1099
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:29,677
<i>not because we are, but because
we actually like each other. </i>

1100
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,811
<i>There are even times
when I don't mind</i>

1101

1102
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,482

1103
01:19:40,589 --> 01:19:42,750
<i>It is what it is. </i>

1104
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:46,385
<i>And there are
a lot of liars out there. </i>

1105
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:50,192
<i>Now I'm just starting to do
something about It. </i>

1106
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:57,130
<i>Same thing. Whatever. </i>

1107
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:59,707
<i>Those 3 stupid words

<i>and no truth?</i>

1115
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:33,231
<i>What may be a lie to one person

- Mom, I'll be fine.

- Remember, keeps your hands at--
- 10 and 2, Mom. I know.

1126
01:21:12,514 --> 01:21:14,982
There will probably be a few

<i>Mom...</i>

1128
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:22,413
Your father would have been
a much better driving instructor.

1129
01:21:22,524 --> 01:21:24,958
I like the one I had just fine.

1130
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,459
Well, I tried.

1131
01:21:26,628 --> 01:21:29,358

- Is that you?
- No.

1134
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:36,464
You know, you never did tell me

1135
01:21:36,572 --> 01:21:38,733
why this sudden urge
to get your license.

1136
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:43,273
I got sick of relying
on people for a ride.

1137
01:21:44,012 --> 01:21:46,037
Well, I don't want you
driving at night.

- Okay.

<i>And I reached out through the ether,

1172
