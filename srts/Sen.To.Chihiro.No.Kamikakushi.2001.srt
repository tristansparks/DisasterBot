- Huh?
- You're a bad germ from

So stay here and play with me.

860

- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

861

That's why I've never left this room.

862

Staying in this room

Maybe he swallowed something.

Yubaba is furious.

I thought I'd drown, but the water
carried me to shore.

It finally came back to me.

1238

The river's name was
the Kalaku River.

That must be why I can't
find my way home, Chihiro.
