1
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,055
Excuse me.

2
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,269
Come on, honey,
let's get you ready for bed.

3
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,366
DUKE: I am no one special...

4
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,452
just a common man
with common thoughts.

5
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,038
I've led a common life.

6
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,040
There are no monuments
dedicated to me.

7
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,835
And my name
will soon be forgotten.

8
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,712
But in one respect...

9
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,215
I've succeeded as gloriously
as anyone who ever lived.

10
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,342
- Looking good, Duke.
- Feeling good.

11
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,470
I've loved another
with all my heart and soul...

12
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,307
and for me that has
always been enough.

13
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,892
How's it hanging, Harry?

14
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,519
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

15
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,314
Well, you can't have everything.

16
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,109
Big day today.

17
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,321
You say that every day,
you old devil.

18
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,990
It's a lovely day outside.

19
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,159
Let's take a walk.

20
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,493
I don't think so.

21
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,996
Well, we've got to get
you out of this room.

22
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,957
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air would do you good.

23
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,584
Hello.

24
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,296
I'm sorry, it's not a good day.

25
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,340
I don't think she's up for anything.

26
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,091
Hello?

27
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:24,013
This is Duke, he's come to read to you.

28
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,641
- Read?
- Mm-hm.

29
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,519
No. I don't know.

30
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:35,358
Oh, come on, you'll like him.
He's very funny.

32
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,959
All right, now,
where did we leave off?

33
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,629
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was the night of the carnival.

34
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,465
Noah was there with his friends
Fin and Sara.

35
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,551
- Noah?
- That's where they met.

36
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,137
June 6th, 1940.

37
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,474
Allie was 17 years old.

38
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,227
- BARKER 1: Little man wins a prize.
- Damn!

39
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,437
- Thank you for playing.
- Ha, you're real funny.

40
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,981
Man, I clobbered that thing.

41
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,668
I'm telling you,
these games are fixed.

42
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,234
- Hello.
- GIRL: How are you?

43
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,152
Hi, what's your name?

44
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,862
BARKER 2: Step right up here.

45
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,323
Over the hook, yeah.

(LAUGHING AND SCREAMING)

47
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,580
- Who's this girl with Sara?
- Her name's Allie Hamilton.

48
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,376
She's here for the summer with her family.
Dad's got more money than God.

49
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,503
- Hi, Fin!
- FIN: Hi, honey.

50
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,046
Look, I won you a prize.

Ow!

54
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,682
Pretty great, huh?

55
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,600
Hey, Allie, you want
some cotton candy?

56
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,853
- Um, okay.
- GIRL: That would be so much fun.

BARKER: You only get one chance, son.

59
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,693
- You want to dance with me?
- No.

60
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,612
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

61
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,449
Noah, she's with us.

62
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,326
Hey, Allie, you wanna
ride the Ferris wheel?

63
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,413
- I'd love to.
- All right.

64
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,625
Excuse me.

65
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,507
- Noah Calhoun.
- What?

66
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,218
Works down
at the lumberyard with Fin.

67
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,012
Oh.

68
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,432
Did you see he was standing
like two inches away from my face?

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,602
Yeah, I saw. That's Noah, though.

70
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,689
You know, I'm surprised he even came over.
I think he likes you.

I'll pay you when I get down, Tommy.

I'm Noah Calhoun.

- So?
- So it's really nice to meet you.

79

- Allie, who is this guy?
- I don't know. Noah Calhoun.

80

- I would really like to take you out.
- Friend! Do you mind?

81
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,025
You can't sit more than two people
in a chair, Noah.

82

Okay, Tommy, all right.

83

- Why not?

- How could I forget?

I wanted to clear that up with you.
I'm really sorry about that.

up a Ferris wheel to talk to somebody.

- The date that you agreed to.
- No.

and you swore it.

00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,281
Good.

519
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,535
- Where are you going?
- In here.

520
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,289
Wow.

Oh, God.

525
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,320
Oh, make love to me.

526
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,854
- Noah. Um...
- Yeah?

527
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,648
I know I said that I wanted you
to make love to me...

528
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,016
- but I think you...
- Yeah?

529
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,665
You're gonna have to
talk me through this.

531
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,781
- Right. You all right?
- Yeah.

532
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,616
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no.

533
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,161
I'm just... I'm just having
a lot of thoughts.

Oh, never mind.

536
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,175
Like, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking right now?

537
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,136
You know, right this second?

538
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,721
- Uh...
- Did you know...

539
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,766
that this was gonna happen
when you brought me here?

540
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,017
- No.
- No?

541
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,853
- No.
- No, you didn't think about it?

542
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,856
- Of course I thought about it.
- You did?

543
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,941
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did you think?

544
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,611
Oh, I'm talking too much, aren't I?

545
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,572
Okay, okay, I'm just gonna shut up.

546
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,907
Mum's the word.

547
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,700
Okay.

00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,454
- You all right?
- Yeah.

- Uh-huh.
- All right.

550
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,543
I just don't understand
how come you're so quiet.

You don't have one thought?

552
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,798
I'm going crazy over here...

553
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,217
but, no, with you, everything's fine.

554
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,719
You don't have a care in the world?

555
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,520
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,481
I wanted this to be so perfect...

557
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,858
and now I can't shut up.

558
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,530
I love you.

559
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,408
Did you know that?

560
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,925
I love you too.

00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,310
Yeah.

You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

What? Fin, get out of here!

Look, I'm sorry, but Allie's
parents are going crazy.

567
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,791
They got every cop in town
out looking for her.

- ALLIE: You sent the police for me?
- ANNE: Yes.

569
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,309
It is 2 in the morning.
We sent the police.

570
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,604
Thank God you're all right.
Where you been?

571
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,230
Mr. Hamilton, all this is my fault.

572
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,608
Would you give us a moment, please?

573
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,943
I'd like to talk to my daughter.

Alone, young lady.

JOHN: Thanks for everything, lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT: You bet, John, anytime.

577
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,335
You go straight home now, it's late.

578
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,384
Sir, it's really not her fault.

579
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,595
I lost track of time.

580
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,014

ANNE: "I'm sorry, Daddy"?

584
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,323
Think you can bat your eyelashes
at your father and get away with it?

585
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,160
No. This time there's going to start
being some rules around here.

586
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,411
ALLIE: Like what?

587
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,459
ANNE:
If your father won't enforce them, I will.

588
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,501
- ALLIE: Like what, Mother?
- ANNE: You are gonna stop seeing Noah.

589
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,754
She is out fooling around with that boy
till 2:00 in the morning.

590
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,131
It has got to stop.

591
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,051
I didn't spend 17 years of my life
raising a daughter...

592
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,887
and giving her everything
so she could throw it away...

593
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,735
- on a summer romance.
- Daddy, come on!

594
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,849
She will wind up with her
heart broken or pregnant.

- JOHN: Anne, please.
- Now, he is a nice boy.

596
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,397
- He's a nice boy, but he's...
- He's what? He's what? Tell me.

597
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,108
He is trash, trash, trash. Not for you.

598

- ALLIE: Trash?
- ANNE: He's a laborer. He's a woodworker.

- ALLIE: So what?
- ANNE: What are you gonna do?

600

Are you gonna move down here, live in his
father's house and pop out a few kids?

ALLIE: Yeah, well, I wouldn't mind.

Don't touch me!

603
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,417
You are not to see him anymore,
and that's final.

- No, it's not final.
- Yes, it is.

you don't know anything about love.

Oh, and you do?

You don't look at Daddy
the way I look at Noah.

- No, it's not.

Phew.

- I'm gonna go.
- No, I don't want you to go.

627
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,626
I gotta think about some stuff.

ALLIE:
What do you gotta think about, huh?

629
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,339
Come here and talk to me.

630
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,675
- Talk to me!
- About what? You want...

631
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,719
You're going away!

632
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,764
You're leaving.

633
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,225
And I'm staying here.

634
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,520
And I'm so happy
that you're doing that...

635
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,064
but you're gonna have
a million things to do.

636
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,690
- No.
- You got so much ahead of you.

637
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,068
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

638
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:49,571
I'm not gonna have nice things,
fancy things.

639
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,365
It doesn't...

640
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,035
It's never gonna happen for me.
It's not in the cards for me.

641
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,243
- I don't have to go to school, okay?
- Yes, you do.

642
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,123
- I can stay here.
- No.

643
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,417
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.
- Then you can come with me.

644
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,213
- To New York?
- Yes.

645
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,508
What am I gonna do in New York?

646
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,928
Be with me?

647
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,726
Yeah.

648
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,314
I don't know.

649
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,114
We don't gotta figure
all this out tonight, you know?

650
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,658
We'll finish out the summer
and we'll see what happens.

651
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,870
You saying you want to break it off?

652
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,747
What I'm saying,
we see how it goes later on.

653
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,506
Are you breaking up with me?

654
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,303
I don't see how it's gonna work.

655
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,307
I see.

656
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,685
Please don't do this.

657
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,979
You don't mean it.

658
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,942
Oh, hell, well, if you're gonna do it,
why wait until the summer ends, huh?

659
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,695
Why don't you just do it right now?

660
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,406
Huh? Come on.

661
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,814
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

662
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,951
Do it! Do it!

663
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,870
Do it right now.

664
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,206
Do it! Aah!

665
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,625
Stop it! Oh!

666
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,377
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
It's over.

667
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,463
Okay? It's over.

668
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,049
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

669
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,926
I hate you, I hate you.

670
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,427
I'm gonna go.

671
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,222
Why don't you?
Why don't you just go? Get out.

672
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,476
Leave! Go! Go!

673
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,480
No, no, just wait a minute.
We're not really breaking up, are we?

674
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,774
Come on.
This is just a fight we're having.

675
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:52,486
And tomorrow it'll be
like it never happened, right?

676
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,493
- Gone?
- Gone.

677
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,745
Well, she must have been devastated.

678
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,288
She was.

679
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,165
He was only trying
to do the right thing.

680
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,708
Yeah.

681
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:10,379
But what he really should have done
is just told those parents to go to hell.

682
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,172
Just stick it where the sun don't shine.

683
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,676
Yeah, you're right, probably should've.

684
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,345
DUKE: The next day...

685
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:22,849
Allie woke up to find her world
completely changed.

686
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,233
What's going on?

687

- I made a promise to a man.

01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:14,923
Why did you call me darling?
I don't know you.

1550
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,550
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

1551
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:21,179
- Allie. Allie, sweetheart.
- No, no, no!

1552
01:49:21,347 --> 01:49:23,806
Hey, Allie, I love you,
stay with me, don't leave...

1553
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:25,475
No!

1554
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:29,270
- Who are you?
- I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.

1555
01:49:29,438 --> 01:49:31,856
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

1556
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:33,900
- Come on, baby.
- Don't come near me!

1557
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:35,948
- Don't you come near me!
- Allie... Allie, I...

1558
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,779
Help! Help!

1559
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,822
- Help me!
- Calm down, Allie, calm down.

1560
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:42,310
- No, not you!
- Calm down, Allie! It's all right, come on.

1561
01:49:42,368 --> 01:49:44,128
- No! Let me go!
- It's all right. Calm down.

1562
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:47,830
- No! Leave me alone.
- Calm down, Allie, it's all right.

1563
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:49,457
- Somebody help me!
- Now calm down.

1564
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:51,000
- Help!
- Doctor!

1565
01:49:51,168 --> 01:49:53,044
- Talk to me.
- NURSE: She's sundowning.

1566
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,588
- Somebody help me!
- NURSE: Calm down!

1567
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:58,258
- DOCTOR: Give her two cc's.
- ALLIE: No! No!

1568
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,467
NURSE: Calm down, Allie.

1569
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:01,177
DOCTOR: One, two, three.

1570
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:02,679
(SCREAMS)

1571
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:05,515
- Allie, it's all right. It's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1572
01:50:05,683 --> 01:50:07,433
Okay, now take a look.

1573
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:09,936
Let's take a look. One. Oh, she's fine.

1574
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:12,522
- Good. Just breathe. Shh.
- She's fine. She's fine.

1575
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:15,149
Stay calm, just breathe
in and out, come on.

1576
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:17,402
- NURSE: Relax.
- DOCTOR: You're gonna be okay, Allie.

1577
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,028
- NURSE: Relax.
- DOCTOR: Allie?

1578
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:21,197
You're fine, honey.

1579
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:22,699
Shh.

1580
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:22,258
NURSE: Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

1581
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:25,261
Mr. Calhoun?

1582
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:28,765
Call Dr. Von Pettit, MUSC, okay?

1583
01:51:28,932 --> 01:51:31,434
I've got no BP, I got no pulse.
I've got nothing.

1584
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:33,770
Let them know we're in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.

1585
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,772
NURSE: Okay, will do.

1586
01:51:52,998 --> 01:51:55,333
We talked about this.

1587
01:51:55,501 --> 01:51:58,211
It's all right now.
Come on, come on, precious.

1588
01:51:58,379 --> 01:52:00,296
Okay, yes, come on, let's go.

1589
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:02,632
It's okay, baby, come on.

1590
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,176
You know Mr. Holmes.

1591
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:10,848
NURSE: Just try it.

1592
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,855
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

1593
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:00,940
Welcome back.

1594
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:05,111
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

1595
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:08,364
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.

1596
01:53:08,532 --> 01:53:10,575
I can't sleep.

1597
01:53:10,742 --> 01:53:13,411
Well, you know you're not supposed to,
it's against the rules.

1598
01:53:13,579 --> 01:53:15,246
Yeah, I know.

1599
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,958
You weren't really going
for a walk, were you?

1600
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,627
You were going to see Miss Allie.

1601
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:24,881
I just got out of the hospital.

1602
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:26,799
And I miss her.

1603
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:28,718
Mr. Calhoun.

1604
01:53:28,886 --> 01:53:31,888
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her tonight.

1605
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:34,932
Now you're gonna have
to go back to your room.

1606
01:53:37,186 --> 01:53:38,603
As for me...

1607
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:42,857
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get myself a cup of coffee.

1608
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:46,152
I won't be back to check on you
for a while.

1609
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,905
So don't do anything foolish.

1610
01:54:44,294 --> 01:54:45,753
Hi.

1611
01:54:55,222 --> 01:55:00,017
Noah.

1612
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:04,438
Hi, sweetheart.

1613
01:55:05,232 --> 01:55:08,818
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to be here to read to you.

1614
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:12,154
I didn't know what to do.

1615
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:14,615
I was afraid you were never coming back.

1616
01:55:14,783 --> 01:55:17,201
I'll always come back.

1617
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:24,166
What's gonna happen...

1618
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:28,838
when I can't remember
anything anymore?

1619
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:31,465
What will you do?

1620
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:34,135
Oh, I'll be here.

1621
01:55:34,303 --> 01:55:36,429
I'll never leave you.

1622
01:55:45,772 --> 01:55:48,065
I need to ask you something.

1623
01:55:48,233 --> 01:55:50,484
What is it, sweetheart?

1624
01:55:54,698 --> 01:55:56,532
Do you think...

1625
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:59,619
that our love...

1626
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:02,121
can create miracles?

1627
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,249
Yes, I do.

1628
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:10,671
That's what brings you back
to me each time.

1629
01:56:18,347 --> 01:56:20,514
Do you think our love...

1630
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,893
could take us away together?

1631
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,362
I think our love can do
anything we want it to.

1632
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:48,918
I love you.

1633
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:52,296
I love you, Allie.

1634
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:13,109
Good night.

1635
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,533
I'll be seeing you.

1636
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:24,286
