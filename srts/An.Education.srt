1
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:19,397
4, 5, 6

2
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:23,906
7, 8. Now, girls...

3
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,438
Come on, girls. Anybody?

4
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,736
Anybody else?

5
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:44,865
Jenny, again.

6
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,692
Isn't it because Mr. Rochester is blind?

7
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,651
Yes, Jenny.

8
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:54,490
I've got an English essay to do
by tomorrow morning.

9
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:58,119
Right. So the only sound I want to
hear coming through the ceiling

10
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:01,249
is the sound of sweat
dripping onto textbooks.

11
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:03,464
- Cello?
- No cello.

12
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,549
I thought we agreed that
cello was my interest or hobby.

13
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:09,211
Well, it already is
your interest or hobby.

14
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:11,430
So when they ask you
at the Oxford interview,

15
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:13,012
"What is your interest or hobby?"

16
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:15,309
you can say the cello
and you won't be lying.

17
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,769
But you don't have to practice a hobby.

18
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,775
A hobby is a hobby.

19
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,066
Can I stop going
to the youth orchestra, then?

20
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,771
No! No, no, the youth orchestra's
a good thing.

21
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:30,693
- That shows you're a joiner-inner.
- Yes, but I've already joined in.

22
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,906
So now I can stop.

23
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:39,085
No! No, that just shows the opposite.
Don't you see?

24
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:42,382
No, that shows you're a rebel.
They don't want that at Oxford.

25
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:44,790
No. They don't want people
who can think for themselves.

26
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:46,462
No, of course they don't.

27
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:31,671
- See you Wednesday.
- All right, okay. Bye.

28
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:37,135
Jenny? Should I wear, like, Sunday best?

29
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:38,890
Better, I'm afraid.

30
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,808
Just to show my father you're
un jeune homme sérieux, not a Teddy Boy.

31
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:46,021
God. Right.

32
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,613
I'm going to go.
It's going to bucket down in a minute.

33
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:54,822
- Okay, right.
- I'll see you at the weekend.

34
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,580
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

35
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,124
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

36
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:02,537
Goodbye, my love!

37
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,337
Come on, come on.

38
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:13,713
- No!
- Stop it now, stop it. That's enough.

39
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:16,265
Now look what you've done.

40
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:20,096
Come here.
The nice man's waiting for us.

41
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:22,097
- It fell off!
- No, it didn't fall off.

42
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,938
- You kicked it off. Now, come on.
- But my sock's all wet!

43
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:40,872
Hello. Look, if you had any sense,

44
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,369
you wouldn't take a lift
from a strange man,

45
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,081
but I'm a music lover
and I'm worried about your cello,

46
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:49,873
so what I propose is you put it
in my car and walk alongside me.

47
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:55,044
How do I know
you won't just drive off with the cello?

48
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:57,835
Good point.

49
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,813
How much does a new cello cost?
£10, £15? I don't know.

50
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:06,305
Let's say 15.

51
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,027
No? All right.

52
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,190
Up to you.

53
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,956
- And that.
- Right.

54
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,083
- I'm David, by the way.
- Jenny.

55
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:31,668
Very good.

56
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:45,561
- How did the concert go?
- It was a rehearsal.

57
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,186
- The concert's next Thursday.
- What are you playing?

58
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:50,108
Elgar.

59
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:54,148
I think it's a shame he spent
so much time in Worcester, don't you?

60
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,276
Because Worcester's too near Birmingham,
and you can hear that in the music.

61
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,453
There's a terrible Brummy accent
in there, if you listen hard enough.

62
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,783
Anyway, Elgar and the Jews
don't mix very well.

63
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,878
- I'm not a Jew.
- No, I am.

64
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,037
I wasn't accusing you.

65
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,966
Can I sit in the car with my cello?

66
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,890
Jump in.

67
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,860
I've never seen a car like this before.
C'est très chic.

68
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,821
It's a Bristol. Not many of them made.

69
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:43,488
- Where to, madam?
- I only live round the corner.

70
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,620
- Worse luck.
- I'll see what I can do.

71
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:06,134
I suppose cellists must go
to a lot of concerts.

72
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:10,310
We don't go to any concerts.
We don't believe in them.

73
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,649
- They're real.
- So people say.

74
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:16,811
- Smoke?
- I'd better not.

75
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:19,574
I live just up there.

76
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,781
- Why don't we believe in them?
- He'd say there's no point to them.

77
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,034
- Your father, this is?
- Yes.

78
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,538
They're just for fun.

79
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:36,170
Apart from school concerts, which are
no fun at all, so we go to those.

80
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,501
- They don't help you get on.
- Which, of course,

81
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:41,386
is what's so wonderful about them.

82
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,181
- Anyway, you'll go one day.
- I know. I will.

83
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:49,887
If I go to university,
I'm going to read what I want

84
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,222
and listen to what I want,

85
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:55,850
and I'm going to look at paintings
and watch French films

86
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:58,482
and I'm going to talk to people
who know lots about lots.

87
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,113
- Good for you.
- Yes.

88
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:06,157
- Which university?
- Oxford. If I'm lucky.

89
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:10,116
Did you go anywhere?

90
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,201
I studied what I believe they call
"the university of life".

91
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:15,036
I didn't get a very good degree, though.

92
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:22,506
Well, thank you for driving me home.

93
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,980
- Are you all right? Have you got it?
- Yes, it's fine.

94
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,351
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

95
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,610
♫ Sous le ciel de Paris
marchent des amoureux ♫

96
00:09:57,881 --> 00:10:01,546
♫ Sous le pont de Bercy ♫

97
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:05,301
♫ Un philosophe assis ♫

98
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:08,840
♫ Deux musiciens, quelques badauds ♫

99
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:11,934
♫ Puis les gens par milliers ♫

100
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,141
I don't want to hear
any French singing!

101
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,687
French singing wasn't on the syllabus
last time I looked!

102
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,988
- Battenberg?
- Thank you.

103
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:28,945
I actually like the crust.

104
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,239
So where are you applying, Graham?

105
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,617
- I'm not sure yet.
- Well! When will you be sure?

106
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,088
You can't let the grass grow
under your feet, young man.

107
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,090
- I might take a year off.
- What for?

108
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,091
I don't know,
maybe do some travelling.

109
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,305
That sort of thing.

110
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:51,552
Travelling?

111
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,811
What are you, a Teddy Boy?

112
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,274
You know she's going to Oxford,
don't you?

113
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,234
If we get her Latin up to scratch.

114
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:04,855
So while she's studying English
at Oxford,

115
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:06,691
you'll be the wandering Jew.

116
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:11,287
Mr. Mellor, I'm not a Teddy Boy.

117
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,454
I'm an homme sérieux jeune.

118
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:18,953
No. Yeah!

119
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:22,710
I'm a homme jeune sérieux. A homme...

120
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:38,767
- They're for me.
- Who are they from?

121
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,895
- Gosh. Him.
- What's this?

122
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:49,234
Jack, I'm afraid Jenny's been sent
some flowers from a chap.

123
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,532
- A chap? What kind of chap?
- He's wishing me luck for tonight.

124
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:54,289
Is that all he's wishing you?
Where'd he get the money from?

125
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:57,575
- He earns it, I expect.
- Earns it? Why isn't he at school?

126
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,161
Can we just go?

127
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,079
Otherwise the good luck flowers
will actually be responsible

128
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,705
for me actually missing the concert,
which would be ironic, n'est-ce pas?

129
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,423
- I don't... I don't like it.
- Objection noted. Jenny?

130
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:14,424
- Noted.
- Yeah, well...

131
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,055
There's got to be 10 bob's worth
of luck here. I mean...

132
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:19,054
That's a bit much for a schoolgirl,
isn't it?

133
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:20,766
Well, we can't leave it here!

134
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,230
I mean, even I'd burgle a house
with flowers left outside.

135
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,061
They'll think we're made of money.

136
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,979
Thank you, Marjorie.

137
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:32,440
Camus doesn't want you to like him.
Feeling is bourgeois.

138
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,991
Being engagée is bourgeois.

139
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,743
He kills someone,
and he doesn't feel anything.

140
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,786
His mother dies,
and he doesn't feel anything.

141
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,585
I wouldn't feel anything
if my mother died.

142
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:46,629
Does that make me an existentialist?

143
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,293
No. That makes you a cow.

144
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,385
Une vache.

145
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:56,676
Well, after I've been to university,
I'm going to be French,

146
00:12:56,893 --> 00:13:01,887
and I'm going to Paris,
and I'm going to smoke and wear black

147
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,475
and listen to Jacques Brel,

148
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:07,350
and I won't speak, ever.
C'est plus chic comme ça.

149
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,480
- Crikey!
- What?

150
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:15,619
Wait here.

151
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,657
Hello!

152
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,625
Hello.

153
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,416
Hello.
Thank you.

154
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,466
- How did it go?
- Fine, I think.

155
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:35,463
I didn't mess my bit up.

156
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,972
Nobody got thrown out
of the orchestra afterwards.

157
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,765
Always the mark of a cultural triumph.
Listen, I'm glad I ran into you.

158
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,226
- What are you doing on Friday?
- Going to school.

159
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:46,309
I meant in the evening.

160
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,355
Of course. Nothing.

161
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:53,490
Because I'm going to listen to some
Ravel in St. John's Smith Square.

162
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:56,610
My friends Danny and Helen would be
coming, too, so it wouldn't be...

163
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:01,451
I'll tell you what,
I'll come and pick you up,

164
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:02,904
and if your mother and father
disapprove,

165
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,660
then you can have the tickets
and go with one of them.

166
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:06,626
- How does that sound?
- Thank you.

167
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,629
- And I'd like to go with you.
-7:00?

168
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,794
What are they saying?

169
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:19,175
And, probably go for
a spot of supper afterwards.

170
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,674
- Supper?
- If you want to.

171
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,479
Well the thing is,
we'll probably have eaten.

172
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,353
Well, if you'd like supper,

173
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:34,442
then perhaps on Friday
you could not eat?

174
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,406
Yes. Of course.

175
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,996
- A spot of supper?
- You've heard of supper.

176
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,714
We've heard of it,
but we've never eaten it.

177
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,668
So you're going to have
to tell us everything.

178
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,551
Otherwise it's not fair.

179
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,005
- I won't allow it!
- Fine! He's more than happy

180
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,056
- for you to take me.
- Fine, I will.

181
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,018
- Good!
- Well, where is it?

182
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,931
- St. John's Smith Square.
- Where's that?

183
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,480
I don't know.
I'm sure we could find out.

184
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:10,102
It's in Westminster.
Right next door to the Abbey.

185
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:12,315
- How do you know that?
- I had a life

186
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,894
before we were married, you know.
You soon put a stop to that.

187
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,023
- Well, there you are.
- Where are we?

188
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,986
We're near Westminster Abbey.
I'm not going all the way over there.

189
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,366
The trouble is that's where
St. John's Smith Square is.

190
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,910
Well, there must be something on
locally. Where's the paper?

191
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,867
She wants to see someone who can play.

192
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,494
She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland
scratching away. I'll take her.

193
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:33,125
And how do you propose to get there?
RAF helicopter?

194
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,581
- That's him.
- Bloody hell!

195
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,470
- Jack!
- By the way, David's a Jew.

196
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:42,343
A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.

197
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,893
What does she mean by that?
I've never said anything like that!

198
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,099
It's just an expression.
I've got nothing against the Jews...

199
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,267
Glad to hear it. Hello.

200
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:57,065
I didn't mean I've got nothing against
you. No, of course I do mean that.

201
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,240
- Dad.
- No. It's... Sorry, it's just that...

202
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:05,237
You're not the sort of person
that I would be against.

203
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,782
Well, I wouldn't, because I'm not
the kind of person who would be against

204
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,746
people.

205
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm Jack. This is my wife, Marjorie.

206
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:18,710
You didn't tell me
you had a sister, Jenny.

207
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,883
Please.

208
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,642
You're a lucky man, Jack.

209
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:30,556
Yes, I suppose I am.

210
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,361
- This is lovely.
- Thank you.

211
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,279
I'm sorry, David.
Would you like a drink?

212
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:49,458
I'd love one, Jack,
but we're running a little late.

213
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,615
If Jenny's ready,
perhaps we'll shoot off?

214
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:58,081
Actually, David,
Dad has something he has to tell you.

215
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:04,463
No, no. Really. Well, it was just
a question, a point of reference.

216
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:09,218
What's the best way to get to
St. John's Smith Square from here?

217
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,601
It's a straight run, really.
Up to Hammersmith,

218
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:13,645
take the A4 through Kensington,
you're there.

219
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,689
- As simple as that?
- As simple as that.

220
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,279
- Shall I book us some tickets?
- No.

221
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:23,068
Well, have her back by 10:00, David.

222
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,868
Well, I was hoping
she might come with me afterwards

223
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:28,578
for a spot of supper with my Aunt Helen.

224
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,916
Well...

225
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,201
No, no, well...

226
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,837
She's usually in bed by then.

227
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,498
What if I promise
to have her back by 11:30?

228
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,170
Well, it's Friday night,

229
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:46,631
and you are going all the way
to the West End.

230
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:49,382
Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.

231
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,352
All right.

232
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,849
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

233
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,684
Have a nice time.

234
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,151
Come on.

235
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,052
Hello, hello!

236
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:16,247
Are we late?

237
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,079
No, I thought
we were going to miss the beginning,

238
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:19,334
and then it wouldn't be worth going in

239
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:21,130
and we could all go off dancing
or something.

240
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:22,675
Helen is one of the more
reluctant members

241
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,586
- of tonight's audience.
- Hello.

242
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:28,047
Jenny, these are my friends,
Helen and Danny. Shall we?

243
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,631
- Hello.
- All right?

244
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,927
-4, please.
- Thank you, sir.

245
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,310
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

246
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,559
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

247
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:45,943
- Where did you get it from?
- I don't know. Chelsea somewhere.

248
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,287
Yours is... Well, good for
this sort of concert, isn't it?

249
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,493
Thank you.

250
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,825
We should go shopping together one day,
you and I, if you want.

251
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,498
That would be nice.

252
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:04,713
But Chelsea,
c'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.

253
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,469
Sorry?

254
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,633
I just said,
"It's too expensive for me."

255
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:13,883
No, you didn't.
You said something completely different.

256
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,519
No, well...

257
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,517
- I said it in French.
- In French? Why?

258
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,733
I don't know.

259
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,525
Well, Chelsea's too expensive
for me, too, really,

260
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,772
but we don't have to worry about that.

261
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,902
If you want something in Chelsea,
just get David to take you shopping.

262
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,819
Why would David want
to take me shopping?

263
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:28,289
I booked a table at Juliette's.
Will that kill the mood, do you think?

264
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:32,797
I hope so! God, I always think
I'm going to my own funeral

265
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:35,344
when I listen to classical music.

266
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:38,928
- That was classical, wasn't it?
- Yes. Very classical.

267
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:41,101
- As classical as you can get.
- Juliette's it is, then.

268
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:44,807
Heaven forbid we should end the evening
reflecting on our own mortality.

269
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:56,026
♫ I want a Sunday kind of love ♫

270
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:03,704
♫ A love to last past Saturday night ♫

271
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:08,830
Miles Davis, Sartre...

272
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:12,210
Extraordinary woman, Gréco.
Just like you, Helen.

273
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:16,472
What about Chante Françoise Sagan?
Have you heard that one?

274
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,343
- It's wonderful.
- I've only got...

275
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:22,140
I think it's just called Juliette Gréco.

276
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,602
The one with the eyes on the sleeve?
I saved up

277
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,395
and got my French Conversation teacher
to bring it back after Christmas.

278
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:30,154
- You have a French Conversation teacher?
- Yes.

279
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:32,811
Is that why you suddenly speak French
for no reason?

280
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,858
Have you never heard her sing?
She's marvellous.

281
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:38,786
You should see her in Paris,
though, not here.

282
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,032
David will take you.

283
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:46,200
- I'd love to. You'd fit right in.
- Better than here, really.

284
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:48,418
Isn't it wonderful
to find a young person

285
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:51,542
who wants to know things?
There's so much I want you to see.

286
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,671
Are you all right
to come and have a look

287
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,924
at that Pembroke Villas place with me
on Friday, Danny?

288
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:05,094
No, I can't. There's a Burne-Jones
coming up at Christie's on Friday.

289
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:06,648
Desperate to get my hands on it.

290
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,440
You're thinking of buying a Burne-Jones?

291
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,399
A real one?

292
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:13,395
I just have a feeling the
Pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.

293
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:15,280
I love the Pre-Raphaelites!

294
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:17,484
- Do you?
- Yes, of course!

295
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:19,985
Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway.
Not Holman Hunt so much,

296
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,155
- he's so garish.
- Absolutely.

297
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,618
Well, why don't we all go
to the auction together?

298
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:29,328
- Auction! Gosh, how exciting.
- It's Friday morning.

299
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:33,969
Friday.

300
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:39,301
- You're busy?
- Well, yes.

301
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:41,015
Tant pis.

302
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:43,508
Quel dommage.
C'est pas de problème. C'est...

303
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:49,647
- Are you sure you're busy?
- No. I'm sure I could rearrange.

304
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,443
That would be lovely.

305
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:14,172
♫ You got me wrapped around your ♫

306
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:17,212
♫ little finger ♫

307
00:23:17,553 --> 00:23:19,878

314
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:11,637
- What are you doing?
- I can't get this casserole dish clean,

315
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:13,356
it's all burned around the...

316
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,353
It's 25 to 12:00.

317
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:21,280
- We finished tea at 7:00.
- I know what time it is.

318
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:24,112
How was your evening?

319
00:24:25,412 --> 00:24:27,369
Best night of my life.

320
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:37,125
Night, Mum.

321
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:48,974
I think there were 1 violins,
1 cello, 2 violas, a harp...

322
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:50,638
I don't want to hear about Ravel.

323
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:52,556
I want to know
what else was on the programme.

324
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:55,187
It was nothing like that.
He was a perfect gentleman.

325
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:57,564
He just said he wanted to take me places
and show me things.

326
00:24:57,653 --> 00:25:00,108
- "Things"?
- Plural? My God!

327
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:03,735
I knew that Jane Eyre would
eventually work its magic on you.

328
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:06,109
I'm assuming that's what you're all
so animated about.

329
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:07,946
- Of course.
- Jane Eyre

330
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:10,743
- and Jenny's new boyfriend.
- He's not my new boyfriend.

331
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,832
That's true.
He's more of a man friend, actually.

332
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:15,954
- He's got a sports car, Miss Stubbs!
- It's maroon.

333
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:18,667
So could we call him
a Mr. Rochester figure?

334
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,420
I think he must be as blind
as Mr. Rochester.

335
00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:24,300
You may or may not have noticed
I'm trying to steer the subject away

336
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,760
from Jenny's lurid love life
into the matter in hand.

337
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:28,766
And it is clear from this evidence

338
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,594
that most of you know
far too much about the former

339
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,393
and next to nothing about the latter.

340
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:36,389
Reluctantly, I have to admit
that Jenny is clearly an expert on both.

341
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:38,850
Excellent as always, Jenny.

342
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,366
Hello.

343
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,453
Hello.

344
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:14,935
Any further bids?

345
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:18,061
- Sold, then, for 60 guineas.
- Hello.

346
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:20,685
You're late.

347
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:24,985
We now turn to Lot 41.

348
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:28,489
The Tree of Forgiveness
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.

349
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:33,660
This is a rare opportunity to purchase a
key work of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.

350
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:36,833
- Who will start me off at 100 guineas?
- Is it that one?

351
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:38,543
Yes, that's the one.

352
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,044
15 guineas?

353
00:26:42,215 --> 00:26:43,757
20 guineas?

354
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:48,382
Thank you. 40? Thank you, sir.

355
00:26:48,763 --> 00:26:50,507
Do I hear 60?

356
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:54,386
80 guineas? Thank you, sir.

357
00:26:54,477 --> 00:26:56,517
Another one, madam? 100 guineas?

358
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,689
120?

359
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:04,521
No further bids?

360
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:06,649
- Your turn.
- What?

361
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,400
- Any further bids?
- Your turn.

362
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,529
- Any more?
- Quick!

363
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:13,655
120 guineas from the
very eager new bidder.

364
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,408
140, madam?

365
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:18,709
Thank you. 160 guineas?

366
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:21,785
180? Thank you.

367
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:24,083
200 guineas?

368
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,841
220?

369
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:30,554
Another one, madam?

370
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:40,019
Sold for 200 guineas. Thank you.

371
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:43,818
- Your name, please?
- Mellor.

372
00:27:46,696 --> 00:27:49,152
Now we move on to Lot 42...

373
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,731
Thank you very much. I couldn't possibly
have bought it without you.

374
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,949
Just a couple of years ago,

375
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:57,742
you could pick one of them up for 50 quid.
No one was interested.

376
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:00,116
I would have been so interested.

377
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:04,088
As you can see, I just love things.

378
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:10,168
That's not a Lockey-Hill!

379
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:13,137
There aren't many people
who come in here and say that.

380
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:14,337
No, certainly not me.

381
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:17,349
- It's beautiful! Do you play?
- Thank you.

382
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:20,222
I used to. I vowed to myself
that one day I'd own one of these

383
00:28:20,313 --> 00:28:22,140
and now I do own one,
I don't touch the bugger.

384
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:24,847
It's vulgar, really,
putting it on display.

385
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,437
Give it to Jenny.

386
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,988
- I think that would be even more vulgar.
- Play for us, Jenny.

387
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:33,940
- No, one day, when I'm good enough.
- She's good enough now.

388
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:36,324
David, you've never seen me play.

389
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:39,618
I can come and hear you in Oxford,
when you get there.

390
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,534
We should all go
and spend a weekend in Oxford.

391
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:44,830
Straw boaters, punting, cream teas...

392
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:47,127
- Boats.
- ...antiquarian book shops.

393
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:49,293
Bit of business, if we can find it.

394
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:50,959
What about next weekend?

395
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:53,970
Yes.

396
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:55,847
I wouldn't be allowed to do that.

397
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:02,222
- I'll talk to them.
- You're going to ask my father

398
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:04,436
if you can take me away for the weekend?

399
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:06,849
- He'd have you arrested.
- We'll see.

400
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:10,236
- I bet you can't.
- How much?

401
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:13,820
I'd be careful if I were you, Jenny.
You don't know who you're dealing with.

402
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,659
Half a crown.

403
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:17,911
You're on.

404
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,034
How do you know Danny?

405
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:26,288
You know.
We kept bumping into each other,

406
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:28,122
then we became pals,

407
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,753
and we've ended up doing a bit
of business together when it suits us.

408
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:35,508
- What kind of business?
- Property, a bit of art dealing.

409
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,225
Some buying and selling. This and that.

410
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:51,228
- Right. I'll just be 2 ticks.
- Okay.

411
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:05,325
- Mr. Goldman, good to see you.
- Jolly good. Madam.

412
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:07,746
All right.

413
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:15,752
- All right, I've got this one. And...
- Put me down!

414
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:19,722
Go on, then.

415
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:01,423
Sorry about that.

416
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,801
How do you know those negro people?

417
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:08,220
- They're clients.
- Clients?

418
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:11,683
Schvartzers have to live somewhere.

419
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:14,527
It's not as if they can rent
off their own kind, is it?

420
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:25,861
Test results for the Virgil translation.
We'll start from the bottom.

421
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,200
Patricia.

422
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,917
Absent.

423
00:31:30,252 --> 00:31:34,001
Margaret, 48%.

424
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:36,799
Jenny!

425
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:40,754
52%.

426
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,558
That would just about scrape a pass
in the exam proper.

427
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,643
Not good enough for Oxford candidates.

428
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,357
- It's her Latin, isn't it?
- Everyone's doing their best, Jack.

429
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:02,447
But what if everyone's best isn't good
enough? What do we do then?

430
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:06,154
Well, perhaps the whole thing's
been a waste of money, anyway.

431
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:08,322
- You don't mean that.
- Well, what's she going to do

432
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:09,957
with an English degree?

433
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,877
If she's going to spend 3 years
playing that bloody cello,

434
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:15,334
talking in French
to a bunch of beatniks,

435
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:18,459
well, I'm just throwing
good money after bad.

436
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,092
Well, she might meet
a nice lawyer there,

437
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:22,549
but she could do that
at a dinner dance tomorrow!

438
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:25,757
Because that's the point of
an Oxford education, isn't it, Dad?

439
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,305
It's the expensive alternative
to a dinner dance.

440
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:30,602
What about private tuition?

441
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,147
Can anybody hear me?
How much is this going to cost me?

442
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:37,772
5 shillings an hour,
maybe a little more for A-level.

443
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:40,815
5 bob? We spend 5 bob here,
we spend five bob there.

444
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:42,566
Next thing you know,
that's our savings down the drain.

445
00:32:42,658 --> 00:32:44,366
And what else
are we spending 5 bob on?

446
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,159
What else are we spending sixpence on?

447
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:50,498
Nothing! No! Nothing.
All of this is free. This vase is free.

448
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:52,575
It was, actually.
It was a present from Auntie Vi.

449
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:56,617
That chair, this sofa, it's all free.
We didn't have to pay for any of it.

450
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,251
You see,
that's the beauty of life, Jenny.

451
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,084
You don't have to pay for anything.

452
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,177
You know, there's a lovely Oxford tree
growing in the garden.

453
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:06,754
Lucky for you,
because that's Oxford taken care of.

454
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,555
And there's a whole orchard
of school trees, so that school is free,

455
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,218
and I think there's even
a private tuition tree in there.

456
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:15,140
- I'll just go and check, shall I?
- Jack!

457
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:17,390
It's all right, Marjorie.
Don't worry, I'll only be a second,

458
00:33:17,484 --> 00:33:21,268
because I think there's a whole clump of
them surrounding the pocket money tree!

459
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:23,735
I'll just go and make sure
they're all nice and safe, shall I?

460
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:25,199
And by the way, you might be lucky.

461
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:28,119
There might be a man with deep pockets
growing out there,

462
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:30,112
because God knows
you're going to need one!

463
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:39,620
Well, you can always go
to secretarial college with Hattie.

464
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,873
- Thanks.
- Charming!

465
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:45,966
- God. No.
- Hello!

466
00:33:46,888 --> 00:33:48,881
Hello, Graham.

467
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,725
I haven't seen you in ages.

468
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:59,808
It went a bit wrong, didn't it?
The tea party, I mean.

469
00:34:05,073 --> 00:34:07,564
Was it because of the year off thing?
Because I...

470
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,153
No!

471
00:34:10,162 --> 00:34:14,622
I just have so much work to do
if I'm going to get the grades I need.

472
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,794
Yeah, she doesn't have time for boys.

473
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:27,505
- Bye, Graham!
- Bye.

474
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:40,980
And I'll tell you what the first thing

475
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:43,439
my grandfather did when he retired...

476
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:51,568
was to say to my grandmother
when she expired.

477
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:55,614
- You do all the Goons?
- No, my Eccles is no good.

478
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:58,114
- No, you've got him.
- No, no.

479
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,701
- I can't do it...
- Hello.

480
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:07,167
Jenny. David does the most
fantastic Bluebottle.

481
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,594
- You came to see my parents?
- Why is that so hard to imagine?

482
00:35:11,056 --> 00:35:14,092
Why are you drinking?
It's not Christmas.

483
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:16,807
Well, there's a lot you don't know
about us, young lady.

484
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:18,353
We had a life before you came along.

485
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:21,807
That's true. I'm only going on what
I've seen for the last 16 years.

486
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,360
I'm trying to think what you missed.
Nothing much comes to mind.

487
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:33,452
Anyway, I've got a huge pile
of Latin translation to do.

488
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:35,576
But you didn't tell us
David went to Oxford.

489
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:41,035
- No! I didn't.
- For all the good it did me.

490
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:43,583
- Isn't that funny?
- Extraordinary.

491
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:47,580
I was just telling Jack
that I'm going back next weekend.

492
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:50,757
I go and visit my old English professor
every now and again.

493
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:54,671
See, that's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track.

494
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,675
It's not always what you know,
is it, David?

495
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:59,638
Too true.
Have you ever come across Clive Lewis?

496
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:01,811
Dad's never come across anyone.

497
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:06,728
He wrote a children's book called
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

498
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:10,105
- that did very well, I believe.
- CS Lewis.

499
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:12,771
Well, to us he was just the old codger
who taught Medieval Literature,

500
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:16,201
but I came to know him very well.
We just

501
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:18,991
got along.

502
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:21,537
Jenny used to devour those books.

503
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:24,161
I'd love to meet him.

504
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,542
I'm sorry,
am I being slow on the uptake?

505
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,762
Would Jenny like to come at the weekend?

506
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,762
Not this weekend,
but sometime, perhaps. Yes.

507
00:36:39,727 --> 00:36:41,352
How often do you see him?

508
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:45,148
Not very often. Every couple of years.

509
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,770
Maybe next time.

510
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,148
Well, I suppose...

511
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:55,784
Would she have to stay the night?

512
00:36:56,536 --> 00:37:00,201
I wouldn't recommend driving home
after one of those Oxford dinners.

513
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:06,786
Clive could get her a room
at the college. It's easy enough.

514
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:11,209
Seems like too good an opportunity
to pass up.

515
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:15,129
It wouldn't be a bother,
would it, David?

516
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,591
Come on!

517
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:23,892
Just putting a few things in a bag!
Don't worry!

518
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:27,566
♫ Yeah, we both understand ♫

519
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:30,897
♫ Ooh, sweet nothin's ♫

520
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:35,317
Come on!

521
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:37,947
We're nearly ready!
Be there in 2 ticks.

522
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:42,030
How can they only be nearly ready?

523
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:45,282
I wouldn't be surprised
if 3 of them came out of there.

524
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:48,286
It's the only explanation.
They're making themselves a friend.

525
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,997
Ladies, come on, let's go!

526
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:53,964
There, have a look in the corner.
Open the door.

527
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,919
You should keep that one,
if you want it.

528
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:01,390
- One can only wear so many in one day.
- Thank you.

529
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:05,637
What about tonight?
Have you got a pretty enough nightie?

530
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:08,982
Won't I be sharing a room with you?

531
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:11,776
You haven't slept with him.

532
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:15,812
- No.
- Good for you.

533
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:19,365
- Really? Do you think so?
- Yes! Well, you're only 16.

534
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:21,029
- You don't want to get preggers, do you?
- No.

535
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,534
No, I wouldn't let that happen.

536
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:25,415
I want to wait until I'm 17.

537
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,413
- On my 17th birthday, hopefully.
- With David?

538
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,788
Golly, it will be with David, won't it?

539
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:35,208
If that's what you want.
Anyway, I'll find you a nightie.

540
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:43,510
Ta-da!

541
00:38:53,402 --> 00:38:54,731
Shall we make a move?

542
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:01,439
♫ Got me wrapped around
your little finger

543
00:39:02,244 --> 00:39:05,364
♫ If this is love

544
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:10,034
♫ It's everything I hoped it would be

545
00:39:20,804 --> 00:39:22,263
Can't we get out and have a look around?

546
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:25,172
Later, if we have time.

547
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:28,802
- Imagine spending 3 years here.
- I know.

548
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:39,066
Why are university girls
so strange-looking?

549
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,730
They can't all have started off
that way, can they?

550
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:45,241
I mean, most girls aren't born ugly,
but most girl students seem to be,

551
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:46,953
so there must be something
about these places

552
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,372
that make you fat or spotty
or short-sighted.

553
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:52,334
Well, when you look at it like that,

554
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:55,919
I mean, that's proper scientific
analysis. You can't argue with science.

555
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:00,167
I still don't quite understand
what you want to do when you get here.

556
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,719
I want to read English.

557
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:04,930
- Books.
- Sorry?

558
00:40:05,307 --> 00:40:07,216
You want to read English books.

559
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:10,722
"Reading English"
is just another way of saying...

560
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:13,386
Don't worry, Jenny.
You're wasting your breath.

561
00:40:13,482 --> 00:40:16,020
Anyway, tomorrow
we'll get more of a feel for the place.

562
00:40:16,276 --> 00:40:19,895
Absolutely. This place will be good
for a little business.

563
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,947
All those little old ladies
wandering around.

564
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:24,108
- Old ladies?
- This place is rife with stats.

565
00:40:24,284 --> 00:40:26,954
Please explain what stats are.
You're always going on about them.

566
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:31,237
- It isn't very interesting.
- But you two are interested.

567
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,242
That's because
we're not very interesting, either.

568
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:35,078
- No, they're not, really.
- It's true.

569
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,792
That's why we need you here.
To save us from ourselves.

570
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:41,167
Yeah, to put some intelligence
and culture into our brutal lives.

571
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,177
- Sing to us! Sing to us!
- Please don't make me sing for you.

572
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,179
Please don't make us talk about work.

573
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:55,435
So, now, is he Clive, do you think,
or CS?

574
00:40:55,524 --> 00:40:57,232
I'm confused now.
I thought you made him up.

575
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:58,776
No, we...

576
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:01,606
Never mind.

577
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:05,734
"To dear Jenny,
with the pleasure of meeting you.

578
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:08,739
"Come and see me again soon, Clive."

579
00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:11,664
Dirty old man.

580
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,295
No?

581
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:30,179
We've got these exact same curtains
at home.

582
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,593
Let's not talk about curtains.

583
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:37,261
You look beautiful.

584
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:40,403
David.

585
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:44,320
There's something you should know.

586
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,202
I'm a virgin,

587
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:53,746
and I want to stay that way
until I'm 17.

588
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:58,126
I think that's good.
I think that's right.

589
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:09,298
We can still be romantic, though,
can't we?

590
00:42:12,267 --> 00:42:16,596
Yes, of course.
As long as it's not actually...

591
00:42:17,314 --> 00:42:18,808
Minnie.

592
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:21,483
Is that me?

593
00:42:23,194 --> 00:42:26,398
Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse

594
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:31,492
and I'm your bubbalub.

595
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:37,617
Okay. If that's what you want to do.

596
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:41,247
- Minnie.
- Yes, David?

597
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:44,250
Bubbalub.

598
00:42:44,924 --> 00:42:46,419
Bubbalub.

599
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,804
May I have a look?

600
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:00,314
Just a peek.

601
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:04,025
You just want to see them?

602
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,609
Thank you.

603
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:05,460
I think there's a house for sale
around here.

604
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,124
Really?

605
00:44:11,594 --> 00:44:13,127
Might be worth a look.

606
00:44:13,846 --> 00:44:15,424
Right.

607
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:17,927
- Do you want...
- No.

608
00:44:23,147 --> 00:44:25,982
- Jenny!
- Aren't you coming?

609
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:29,068
- We don't go in.
- What are you talking about?

610
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,112
Why don't you go and get
a nice cup of tea somewhere?

611
00:44:32,031 --> 00:44:33,194
Helen will look after you.

612
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:35,820
I don't need looking after,
thank you very much. David...

613
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,950
I'm not going to tell you a second time.

614
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:39,996
Run along.

615
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:52,665
- Well, they won't be long, either way.
- Either way?

616
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,046
Well, sometimes they find something
and sometimes they don't.

617
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:59,638
And when they do find something,
we often have to leave quite quickly.

618
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:03,008
They can be quite naughty sometimes.

619
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:05,101
- Thank you!
- Bye!

620
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:08,060
- Cheerio!
- Catch! Careful. Careful.

621
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:11,403
Come on.

622
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:15,025
- Helen!
- Pass it back. Good!

623
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,697
- Jenny!
- What?

624
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:22,871
You can stand there if you like,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

625
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:40,342
Coo-ee!

626
00:45:40,892 --> 00:45:42,386
Jenny!

627
00:45:43,895 --> 00:45:47,310
Sorry about being
a little brisk back there, Jenny.

628
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:50,810
It's just the way we do things.
Silly, really.

629
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:08,499
Here, don't forget your case.

630
00:46:10,421 --> 00:46:11,619
- Who's coming up for a drink?
- Me!

631
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:14,549
No. You go.
I'll make my own way home.

632
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:19,133
Jenny.

633
00:46:26,103 --> 00:46:27,597
Jenny!

634
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:42,696
It's an old map. A Speed.

635
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:46,071
The poor dear didn't even know
what it was.

636
00:46:46,165 --> 00:46:50,163
What a waste!
It shouldn't spend its life on a wall in

637
00:46:50,795 --> 00:46:52,337
wherever the hell we were.

638
00:46:53,172 --> 00:46:55,959
It should be with us.
We know how to look after it properly.

639
00:46:56,091 --> 00:46:57,965
- We liberated it.
- "Liberated"?

640
00:46:58,177 --> 00:46:59,636
- Yeah!
- That's one word for it.

641
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:02,679
Don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
You're better than that.

642
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:08,092
You drink everything
I put in front of you down in one,

643
00:47:08,354 --> 00:47:11,355
then you slam your glass down on the bar
and ask for more.

644
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:13,483
It's wonderful.

645
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:17,768
We're not clever like you,
so we have to be clever in other ways,

646
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:21,908
because if we weren't,
there would be no fun.

647
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:25,820
We have to be clever with maps and...

648
00:47:26,997 --> 00:47:28,705
You want to know what stats are?

649
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:32,290
Stats are old ladies
who are scared of coloured people.

650
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:35,829
So we move the coloureds in
and the old ladies move out,

651
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:39,251
and I buy their flats cheap.
That's what I do.

652
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,302
So now you know.

653
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:47,685
And if you don't like it,
I'll understand,

654
00:47:47,768 --> 00:47:52,264
and you can go back to Twickenham
and listen to the Home Service

655
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:56,650
and do your Latin homework,

656
00:47:57,027 --> 00:48:00,645
but these weekends,
and the restaurants and the concerts,

657
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:02,815
they don't grow on trees.

658
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,778
This is who we are, Jenny.

659
00:48:30,894 --> 00:48:32,436
That's better.

660
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:50,904
- Come on, you two!
- Come on up!

661
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,451
You can have my olive!

662
00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:57,618
Come on.

663
00:49:14,146 --> 00:49:15,604
I suppose you have homework to do?

664
00:49:24,656 --> 00:49:27,574
You have no idea how boring
everything was before I met you.

665
00:49:30,537 --> 00:49:33,787
"Action is character,"
our English teacher says.

666
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:37,377
I think it means
that if we never did anything,

667
00:49:37,461 --> 00:49:39,418
we wouldn't be anybody.

668
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:42,836
And I never did anything
before I met you.

669
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,211
And sometimes I think no one's ever done
anything in this whole stupid country,

670
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:50,597
apart from you.

671
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,005
- Okay.
- Right.

672
00:50:32,307 --> 00:50:33,801
There you are.

673
00:50:34,684 --> 00:50:36,178
Night.

674
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:52,449
Marjorie, look at this.

675
00:50:56,998 --> 00:50:59,703
"Clive."
Lucky girl!

676
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,867
Never a dull moment with David?

677
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,253
Better than that young man
you brought home for tea.

678
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:07,291
David's a lot older than Graham.

679
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:10,219
Graham could live to be 200 years old,
you'll never see him swanning around

680
00:51:10,303 --> 00:51:12,212
with famous authors.
Hasn't got it in him.

681
00:51:12,305 --> 00:51:14,428
Graham might become a famous author,
for all you know.

682
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:16,757
Becoming one
isn't the same as knowing one.

683
00:51:17,018 --> 00:51:21,063
That shows you're well connected.
Very impressive young man, your David.

684
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:24,690
I must admit, life's a little brighter
with him around.

685
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:31,480
Come on, girls, get a move on!

686
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:40,032
- What the hell are those?
- Russian Sobranies.

687
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,865
Where did they come from?

688
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,329
Well, she probably bought them
from the Savoy, or Claridge's,

689
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:49,715
or the opera or some fancy nightclub.
Who knows with Jenny?

690
00:51:50,343 --> 00:51:52,501
Paris. You can't buy them here.

691
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:55,010
- You never bought them yourself?
- No, I never.

692
00:51:55,098 --> 00:51:57,221
Shut up, you stuck-up cow.

693
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:02,634
But I'll bring you some back,
if you like.

694
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:05,106
- You are joking?
- Non.

695
00:52:05,483 --> 00:52:07,855
- He's taking you to Paris?
- Oui.

696
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:09,860
- This term?
- Peut-être.

697
00:52:11,322 --> 00:52:15,071
Wait. Isn't it your birthday
next Thursday?

698
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:17,528
Might be.

699
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,372
My God. Your birthday?

700
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:21,970
I would not like to be you.

701
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,948
All those suppers you've had off him?
Ouch.

702
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,339
You've such a Victorian attitude
to sex, you two.

703
00:52:28,423 --> 00:52:31,210
Your parents wouldn't let you
swan off like that, would they?

704
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:33,044
Well, we haven't told them yet.

705
00:52:33,177 --> 00:52:35,550
But David will come up with some story.
He usually does.

706
00:52:35,638 --> 00:52:37,049
Yeah, I've noticed that.

707
00:52:37,432 --> 00:52:41,299
Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume.
Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick.

708
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:44,810
Those funny cigarettes you were smoking?
Sobranies. 10 packets each.

709
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:48,480
How much is the Chanel perfume?

710
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:52,820
Are you the girl going to Paris,
or are you not, because...

711
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:00,154
Tina, top button.

712
00:53:02,206 --> 00:53:05,326
Jenny, the headmistress
wants a word with you.

713
00:53:06,085 --> 00:53:10,213
The legend of Mr. Rochester may have
travelled further than you intended.

714
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,048
Come.

715
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:15,963
Miss Mellor.

716
00:53:19,765 --> 00:53:23,466
We're all very excited
about your forthcoming trip to Paris.

717
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:29,770
Our excitement, indeed, knows no bounds.
Some of us can talk of little else.

718
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,352
An older man, I understand?

719
00:53:35,072 --> 00:53:37,480
A word of warning, Miss Mellor.

720
00:53:39,243 --> 00:53:44,119
There may well have been
the odd 6th-form girl who has lost

721
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:47,954
an important part of herself,
perhaps the best part,

722
00:53:48,085 --> 00:53:50,374
while under our supervision.
These things happen, regrettably.

723
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,290
If, however,
we are made aware of that loss,

724
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:54,457
then of course
the young lady in question

725
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,210
would have to continue
her studies elsewhere.

726
00:53:56,302 --> 00:53:58,627
If, that is,
she still has any use for A-levels.

727
00:53:59,096 --> 00:54:01,053
Do I make myself clear?

728
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:05,807
- Can I go now?
- If you would.

729
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,322
What are you doing in there?

730
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:21,190
Well, I imagine
she's lighting the candles on my cake.

731
00:54:21,577 --> 00:54:23,486
You're 17, not 250.

732
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,453
- Thanks for inviting me.
- It was Marjorie's idea, not mine.

733
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:35,046
- Not even Jenny's, for that matter.
- Dad!

734
00:54:35,132 --> 00:54:36,413
Ta-da!

735
00:54:39,512 --> 00:54:41,551
Well, blow them out before
the house burns down.

736
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:45,348
- Make a... Okay, just... Don't wait.
- Bravo.

737
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:51,387
Who'd like a piece?

738
00:54:51,482 --> 00:54:53,309
- Me, please.
- Well, come on, come on. Presents.

739
00:54:54,485 --> 00:54:55,944
It doesn't matter, I'll...

740
00:55:01,283 --> 00:55:02,659
It's a new Latin dictionary.

741
00:55:06,914 --> 00:55:09,405
Thank you. I needed a new one.

742
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:14,044
Dear! Got a... Snap!

743
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:30,726
Good grief!
Jenny, you should see this!

744
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:33,019
- It's a special day.
- She's a special girl!

745
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:34,601
I know it.

746
00:55:37,194 --> 00:55:38,522
Bit of help!

747
00:55:38,612 --> 00:55:40,688
Makes your dictionary look
a bit feeble, Graham?

748
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:42,987
- Gosh!
- And these are for you.

749
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:45,744
- Hello, young man.
- David!

750
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:48,235
- David, would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

751
00:55:48,956 --> 00:55:53,499
I'd best be going, 'cause I've got
a stack of homework to do, so...

752
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:55,622
Well...

753
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:58,038
- Thank you. Bye.
- Cheers.

754
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,792
- Bye, Mr. Mellor.
- Cheerio, Graham.

755
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:02,427
Thank you.

756
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,046
Wonderful to see you, Graham.

757
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,382
- Goodbye, Jenny.
- Bye, Graham.

758
00:56:11,645 --> 00:56:14,218
- A little something warming?
- You know me so well.

759
00:56:14,314 --> 00:56:16,224
- Can I open anything yet?
- Wait for me.

760
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:19,353
Before you open that lot,
I've got a surprise. Next weekend,

761
00:56:19,445 --> 00:56:22,648
we're all going to Café de Flore
to celebrate Jenny's birthday.

762
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:25,693
- Lovely!
- Café de Flore

763
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:28,661
is in the Boulevard St. Germain,
in Paris.

764
00:56:29,913 --> 00:56:32,451
- What do you mean, Paris?
- You know the one, Dad.

765
00:56:34,585 --> 00:56:36,376
No, no. No, no, no.

766
00:56:37,296 --> 00:56:39,335
No, we don't have any French money.

767
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,297
And besides, it's too...

768
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:43,918
Well, I don't think
it would agree with me.

769
00:56:44,178 --> 00:56:46,336
- Dad!
- The French don't like us, Jenny,

770
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,466
you know that. John Sutton, from work,
he went there last year.

771
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:52,843
They were very rude to him.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun,

772
00:56:53,395 --> 00:56:55,553
but it's just not for me, Europe.

773
00:56:56,481 --> 00:56:59,685
- You'll have to go another time.
- You've just said you don't like Europe.

774
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:01,852
So what's going to change?
It'll have to be Europe, won't it,

775
00:57:01,945 --> 00:57:04,519
- because it certainly won't be you.
- I'll take her.

776
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:06,275
- To the continent?
- Why not?

777
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:09,107
- And leave me here on my own?
- For God's sake!

778
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:20,588
What do you think?

779
00:57:22,883 --> 00:57:25,255
You know what Jenny's like
about France, Jack.

780
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:29,254
- French films and books and music.
- Of course I do.

781
00:57:29,348 --> 00:57:32,384
Sorry, yes. It goes without saying.
She's your daughter.

782
00:57:36,605 --> 00:57:38,562
Jenny likes to joke
about how you're a stick-in-the-mud

783
00:57:38,648 --> 00:57:41,815
and all the rest of it,
but I know that's not who you are.

784
00:57:42,736 --> 00:57:45,227
Otherwise, she wouldn't be who she is.

785
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:47,861
No.

786
00:57:47,949 --> 00:57:50,785
But I can also see
that I have acted out of turn,

787
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:53,360
and I'm sorry.

788
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:08,342
What about your Aunt Helen?

789
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:20,305
- An hour late.
- We'll make it. I promise.

790
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,225
Okay, there's a flight
at 8:00 in the morning.

791
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:26,070
Good.

792
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:39,374
There's no bed.

793
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:41,748
I pushed the boat out
and got us a suite.

794
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:43,878
- A suite?
- Yeah.

795
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:46,914
Well, if work stops us
from getting to Paris until tomorrow,

796
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:49,843
then work can buy us a nice hotel room.

797
00:58:51,012 --> 00:58:53,717
Anyway, it's a special occasion,
isn't it?

798
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,350
I'd have thought tonight, of all nights,
we'd only need a bed.

799
00:59:14,953 --> 00:59:18,073
Hold on, one second. I've got something.

800
00:59:31,052 --> 00:59:32,630
I thought...

801
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,678
I thought we might practise with this.

802
00:59:35,974 --> 00:59:37,384
With a banana?

803
00:59:37,475 --> 00:59:40,145
I thought we might get the messy bit
over with first.

804
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:42,646
What?

805
00:59:43,565 --> 00:59:45,023
David!

806
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:48,187
I don't want to lose my virginity
to a piece of fruit!

807
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,197
I'm sorry.

808
00:59:55,034 --> 00:59:56,410
Hey.

809
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:01,614
- I think the moment might have gone.
- Hey, hey...

810
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:04,887
- I think we should wait until Paris.
- I'm sorry

811
01:00:06,004 --> 01:00:07,462
Minnie, I...

812
01:00:10,091 --> 01:00:12,297
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

813
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,178
David,

814
01:00:15,555 --> 01:00:19,090
if tomorrow night does happen,
it's only ever going to happen once.

815
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:22,437
Why will it only ever happen once?

816
01:00:22,812 --> 01:00:24,721
Because the first time
can only ever happen once.

817
01:00:26,774 --> 01:00:30,024
So...no baby talk.

818
01:00:31,446 --> 01:00:32,988
No Minnie.

819
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:42,196
Just treat me like a grown-up.

820
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,244
Okay?

821
01:00:51,674 --> 01:00:54,841
I know.
Let's go and sit in our sitting room.

822
01:00:56,054 --> 01:00:57,512
All right.

823
01:00:58,723 --> 01:01:00,300
We'll order up some champagne.

824
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:13,403
Room service?

825
01:01:14,989 --> 01:01:22,237
♫ Quand doucement tu te penches
En murmurant, "C'est dimanche" ♫

826
01:01:23,122 --> 01:01:26,954
♫ Si nous allions en banlieue
faire un tour ♫

827
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:30,127
♫ Sous le ciel bleu des beaux jours? ♫

828
01:01:30,922 --> 01:01:34,291
♫ Mille projets nous attirent ♫

829
01:01:34,842 --> 01:01:37,926
♫ Mais dans un même sourire ♫

830
01:01:38,804 --> 01:01:42,719
♫ Nous refaisons le trajet
simple et doux ♫

831
01:01:42,808 --> 01:01:47,102
♫ De nos premiers rendez-vous ♫

832
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,270
♫ Sur les quais du vieux Paris ♫

833

♫ Le long de la Seine, le bonheur sourit ♫

01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:02,362

01:02:02,453 --> 01:02:07,162
♫ L'amour se promène en cherchant un nid ♫

841
01:02:42,743 --> 01:02:44,950
Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?

842
01:02:51,669 --> 01:02:53,911
It wasn't too uncomfortable?

843
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,953
Not after the first bit.

844
01:02:59,426 --> 01:03:01,668
It's funny, though, isn't it?

845
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,260
All that poetry and all those songs

846
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:11,186
about something
that lasts no time at all.

847
01:03:13,607 --> 01:03:15,101
Yeah.

848
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:20,897
All your exercise books on my desk
in a pile, please.

849
01:03:23,826 --> 01:03:25,818
I bought this for you.

850
01:03:30,749 --> 01:03:32,825
That's very kind of you.

851
01:03:36,255 --> 01:03:37,749
But I can't accept it.

852
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,758
Why not?

853
01:03:42,303 --> 01:03:43,548
It's because of people like you

854
01:03:43,637 --> 01:03:47,505
that I plough through illiterate essays
by Sandra Lovell about her pony.

855
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,848
But I know where this came from, Jenny,

856
01:03:52,604 --> 01:03:57,148
and if I took it, I feel
I would be betraying both of us.

857
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:13,666
Jenny?

858
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:20,000
You can do anything you want.
You know that.

859
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:23,547
You're clever, and you're pretty.

860
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:30,008
Is your boyfriend interested
in clever, Jenny?

861
01:04:31,852 --> 01:04:33,761
I'm not quite sure
what you're trying to tell me.

862
01:04:33,854 --> 01:04:37,104
I'm telling you to go to Oxford,
no matter what.

863
01:04:38,859 --> 01:04:41,350
Because if you don't,
you'll break my heart.

864
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,489
- Where did you go?
- Cambridge.

865
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:56,451
Well, you're clever and you're pretty,
so presumably clever Miss Stubbs won

866
01:04:56,543 --> 01:04:58,251
and here you are with your pony essays.

867
01:04:59,338 --> 01:05:02,541
I don't know, these last few months,
I've eaten in wonderful restaurants

868
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:07,757
and been to jazz clubs and watched
wonderful films, heard beautiful music.

869
01:05:10,057 --> 01:05:13,011
- Jenny, are you taking precautions?
- It's nothing to do with that.

870
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:15,886
- Isn't it?
- Maybe all our lives are going to end up

871
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:18,351
with pony essays, or housework.

872
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:21,024
And, yes, maybe we'll go to Oxford,

873
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:22,604
but if we're all going to die
the moment we graduate,

874
01:05:22,694 --> 01:05:25,019
isn't it what we do before that counts?

875
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:32,410
I'm sorry you think I'm dead.

876
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:36,825
I don't think you're dead,
I just don't...

877
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:38,874
I think you'd better go
to your next class.

878
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:54,725
Go, go, go!

879
01:05:57,729 --> 01:05:59,389
Well done, Jenny!

880
01:05:59,481 --> 01:06:02,054
I've never won anything before, not even
at the Women's Institute raffle.

881
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:04,439
And I always bet on the sweetest looking
one and he always comes last.

882
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:06,354
- Let's go. Come on.
- Can we do it again? I'm feeling lucky.

883
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:08,149
Come on, let's go,
I don't want to miss him.

884
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,609
- Pick up your 10 bob on the way out.
- I won 10 shillings!

885
01:06:11,993 --> 01:06:15,825
- Who is this man, anyway?
- Peter Rachman. Complete bastard.

886
01:06:16,665 --> 01:06:18,906
Well, why do we have to see him here?

887
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,207
Because he's not the sort of chap
with an office.

888
01:06:25,173 --> 01:06:26,881
All right.

889
01:06:27,926 --> 01:06:29,420
Ladies.

890
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:39,470
A bottle of your finest champagne, please.

891
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,438
There he is.

892
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:48,727
Come on, Jenny, tell them
your good news. Don't be bashful.

893
01:06:48,822 --> 01:06:50,565
No, be Sneezy!

894
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,690
Jenny got 2 As and a B
in her mock A-levels.

895
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:55,991
Like everyone else
in this sophisticated establishment.

896
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,996
- The B was in Latin.
- Seriously, congratulations.

897
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,541
Excuse us.

898
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:07,713
Don't worry too much.

899
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,592
About what?

900
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:14,426
Someone told me that in about 50 years,
no one will speak Latin, probably.

901
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:17,550
Not even Latin people.
So don't worry about your B.

902
01:07:24,065 --> 01:07:25,974
He's even more of a bastard
than I thought.

903
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:28,060
You wouldn't want him
to marry your sister.

904
01:07:28,153 --> 01:07:30,940
You wouldn't want to talk to him
in a club, come to that.

905
01:07:31,906 --> 01:07:35,655
You do know what you're doing,
old chap? With Jenny?

906
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:38,195
- This is the one, Danny.
- Right.

907
01:07:38,997 --> 01:07:40,740
That's it!

908
01:07:41,749 --> 01:07:45,913
- You can see she's different.
- I just don't want to see her hurt.

909
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,569
Have you bought
any more paintings recently?

910
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:20,197
Have I? Yes! Picked up a little Piper.
Good one, I think.

911
01:08:20,371 --> 01:08:23,574
I'm still trying to work out what makes
good things good. It's hard, isn't it?

912
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:26,501
Well, the thing is, Jenny, you know.

913
01:08:27,545 --> 01:08:29,704
Without necessarily being able
to explain why.

914
01:08:29,922 --> 01:08:34,216
See, you have taste.
That's not half the battle.

915
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:36,928
That's the whole war.

916
01:08:58,785 --> 01:09:01,157
Jenny, we should go. It's late.

917
01:09:01,245 --> 01:09:02,574
- Really?
- Yes.

918
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:05,333
Alas. One day school
will be over forever

919
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:07,409
and we can talk about art all night.

920
01:09:07,502 --> 01:09:11,795
- You're all right in a taxi, aren't you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

921
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,624
Let's go. Come on.

922
01:09:15,259 --> 01:09:16,837
Good night.

923
01:09:23,476 --> 01:09:24,970
Wait here.

924
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:34,025
- David, what are you looking for?
- Just...

925
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:38,531
What are you doing?

926
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,486
Will you marry me?

927
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,372
What were you looking for?

928
01:09:46,374 --> 01:09:48,247
I thought I had a ring.

929
01:09:48,626 --> 01:09:51,199
It wouldn't have been the right one,
but it would have done for tonight.

930
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:53,838
David.

931
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:57,217
I'm serious.

932
01:10:02,974 --> 01:10:04,717
You're very sweet.

933
01:10:07,019 --> 01:10:08,763
What do you think?

934
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,734
- Take me home.
- All right.

935
01:10:46,517 --> 01:10:48,141
<i>They do need some looking after,</i>

936
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:50,469
<i>but nothing that will require
too much work.</i>

937
01:10:50,563 --> 01:10:53,018
<i>Just leave them in your potting shed
for a couple of weeks</i>

938
01:10:53,232 --> 01:10:54,560
<i>and they'll look after themselves.</i>

939
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,892
<i>Fine, the potting shed.
Who does he think I am,</i>

940
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,729
<i>Prince Rainier of Monaco?</i>

941
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:05,779
<i>What if I got married
instead of going to college?</i>

942
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,078
- Married?
- Married.

943
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,372
Well, it would depend
on who it was, of course.

944
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:16,042
- Would it? That's interesting.
- Well, of course it would.

945
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,372
I wouldn't want you married off
just for the sake of it.

946
01:11:18,716 --> 01:11:20,922
- Thanks.
- Has somebody asked you?

947
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,002
- Yes.
- Who?

948
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:28,015
- David?
- No. A man I just met walking his dog.

949
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:31,604
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing yet.

950
01:11:32,813 --> 01:11:35,185
Do you have a choice, or is it too late?

951
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,350
Of course she's got a choice!

952
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,690
An interesting one, too?

953
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:44,029
This is where you're supposed to say,
"But what about Oxford?"

954
01:11:44,116 --> 01:11:46,405
Well, look at it another way.

955
01:11:46,493 --> 01:11:48,866
You wouldn't really need to go now,
would you?

956
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:53,537
I wouldn't need to go?
Would you like to expand on that?

957
01:11:53,751 --> 01:11:58,875
- You'd be looked after.
- All that Latin. All those essays!

958
01:12:00,257 --> 01:12:03,875
What was the point? Why didn't you just
send me prowling round nightclubs?

959
01:12:03,969 --> 01:12:06,128
It would have been less trouble
and I might have had more fun!

960
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:09,341
I don't know about nightclubs,
I know about education.

961
01:12:09,433 --> 01:12:11,639
Anyway, looks like
it might have turned out

962
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,186
- for the best.
- How?

963
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,398
He wouldn't want you if you were thick,
now, would he?

964
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:21,484
"May not an ass know
when the cart draws the horse?

965
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,026
"Sings: 'Whoop, Jug! I love thee..."'

966
01:12:24,114 --> 01:12:27,115
When it says "sings",

967
01:12:27,201 --> 01:12:28,992
it means you sing the line.

968
01:12:31,622 --> 01:12:33,282
Never mind. Right. Lear.

969
01:12:33,373 --> 01:12:36,244
"Does any here know me?
This is not Lear.

970
01:12:36,335 --> 01:12:41,127
"Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?
Where are his eyes?"

971
01:12:42,633 --> 01:12:47,259
"Waking? Who is it that
can tell me who I am?"

972
01:12:47,658 --> 01:12:49,552
Miss! Me. I can.

973
01:12:51,516 --> 01:12:54,683
- Jenny.
- What?

974
01:12:57,898 --> 01:12:59,392
Take it off.

975
01:13:01,568 --> 01:13:06,195
My God! Is that what I think it is?
I'm going to be a bridesmaid!

976
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:11,070
You know the school rule on jewellery.

977
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,030
Half the girls in this room
are wearing jewellery.

978
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:14,781
Yes, but none of it's going
to ruin their lives.

979
01:13:18,043 --> 01:13:19,667
We have a difference of opinion
about that.

980
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:26,088
How far advanced
are these ridiculous plans?

981
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:29,041
Have you set a date?
Have you decided on a church?

982
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,799
We won't be getting married in a church.
David's Jewish.

983
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:36,352
Jewish?

984
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:39,599
He's a Jew?

985
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:44,016
You are aware, I take it,
that the Jews killed our Lord?

986
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:46,982
And you're aware, I suppose,
that our Lord was Jewish?

987
01:13:48,865 --> 01:13:50,941
I suppose he told you that.

988
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:55,615
We're all very sorry about what
happened during the war,

989
01:13:55,705 --> 01:13:57,615
but that's absolutely no excuse

990
01:13:57,707 --> 01:14:00,661
for that sort of malicious
and untruthful propaganda.

991
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,505
Anyway, I can see you're far more
in need of responsible advice

992
01:14:04,589 --> 01:14:06,131
than I realised.

993
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:10,842
Nobody does anything worth doing
without a degree.

994
01:14:11,638 --> 01:14:15,137
Nobody does anything worth doing
with a degree. No woman, anyway.

995
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,724
So what I do isn't worth doing?

996
01:14:17,811 --> 01:14:20,728
Or what Miss Stubbs does,
or Mrs. Wilson, or any of us here?

997
01:14:20,897 --> 01:14:22,689
Because none of us would be here
without a degree.

998
01:14:22,774 --> 01:14:24,482
You do realise that, don't you?
And yes, of course,

999
01:14:24,609 --> 01:14:26,685
- studying is hard and boring...
- Boring!

1000
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,067
- I'm sorry?
- Studying is hard and boring.

1001
01:14:30,156 --> 01:14:33,490
Teaching is hard and boring. So
what you're telling me is to be bored,

1002
01:14:33,577 --> 01:14:35,699
and then bored and finally, bored again

1003
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:37,329
but this time for the rest of my life?

1004
01:14:37,622 --> 01:14:39,947
This whole stupid country is bored.

1005
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:44,705
There's no life in it, or colour
or fun. It's probably just as well

1006
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:46,872
the Russians are going to drop
a nuclear bomb on us any day now.

1007
01:14:46,965 --> 01:14:51,128
So my choice is
to do something hard and boring,

1008
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:54,054
or to marry my Jew

1009
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:57,805
and go to Paris and Rome
and listen to jazz

1010
01:14:57,892 --> 01:15:01,760
and read and eat good food
in nice restaurants and have fun.

1011
01:15:02,605 --> 01:15:04,728
It's not enough to educate us
any more, Mrs. Walters.

1012
01:15:04,816 --> 01:15:06,690
You've got to tell us
why you're doing it.

1013
01:15:09,863 --> 01:15:13,777
It doesn't have to be teaching,
you know. There's the Civil Service.

1014
01:15:18,663 --> 01:15:21,154
I don't wish to be impertinent,
Mrs. Walters,

1015
01:15:22,042 --> 01:15:24,497
but it is an argument worth rehearsing.

1016
01:15:25,211 --> 01:15:29,161
You never know, someone else might want
to know the point of it all one day.

1017
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:21,297
- Where did you find him?
- I can't tell you that.

1018
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:23,349
- Why?
- I think he likes you. Do you like her?

1019
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:26,603
"Yes, I do like her."
You do? You don't...

1020
01:16:26,689 --> 01:16:29,359
You don't remember? It's Jenny.
You remember her from last time.

1021
01:16:29,442 --> 01:16:33,107
"No, I don't." Yes, you do!
Naughty thing. You... Pardon?

1022
01:16:33,196 --> 01:16:36,778
That's revolting!
You stick to your own species.

1023
01:16:36,866 --> 01:16:39,737
He wants to kiss you, I think.

1024
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:41,322
Is that naughty?

1025
01:16:42,246 --> 01:16:44,120
- We're engaged.
- Who is?

1026
01:16:44,582 --> 01:16:47,287
- No! Really?
- Yeah.

1027
01:16:47,377 --> 01:16:48,657
- Engaged?
- Show her.

1028
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:50,911
- Yes! Look.
- Gosh!

1029
01:16:51,589 --> 01:16:54,294
- That's fantastic news!
- Thank you.

1030
01:16:55,259 --> 01:16:56,374
Congratulations.

1031
01:16:56,469 --> 01:16:59,553
I knew you'd see sense about university.
You'll stay pretty now.

1032
01:16:59,889 --> 01:17:01,514
Can I still read?

1033
01:17:01,599 --> 01:17:03,722
Of course. But it doesn't have to be
books now, does it?

1034
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:07,013
Magazines will do just as well,
and you learn more from them, anyway.

1035
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:09,602
- Helen.
- Well you won't be laughing, David,

1036
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,979
when she goes all speccy and spotty.

1037
01:17:19,992 --> 01:17:22,614
Danny didn't seem very pleased
about our engagement.

1038
01:17:22,703 --> 01:17:25,574
I noticed that, too.
I thought he might be a bit jealous.

1039
01:17:26,499 --> 01:17:28,207
Jealous?

1040
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:30,618
We're going to keep him away from you.

1041
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,547
I mean, what is one supposed to order
as a starter, anyway?

1042
01:17:40,638 --> 01:17:42,844
And how will I know
what is a starter and what isn't?

1043
01:17:42,932 --> 01:17:46,632
We've been through this, Dad. It'll be
quite clearly marked on the menu.

1044
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:50,019
Can't the 3 of you just go
on your own and leave me here?

1045
01:17:50,106 --> 01:17:51,648
I'd be perfectly happy
with a tin of salmon.

1046
01:17:56,696 --> 01:17:58,522
- Hello.
- Hello.

1047
01:18:03,452 --> 01:18:05,694
Ready?
I think you'll like this place, Jack.

1048
01:18:05,788 --> 01:18:07,946
Their wine list is as good
as anything I've seen in London.

1049
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,700
Yes. Someone told me that.

1050
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:12,201
David, probably.
Who else would it have been?

1051
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,339
Madame.

1052
01:18:16,549 --> 01:18:18,292
I was hoping you'd take us in this.

1053
01:18:18,384 --> 01:18:20,423
You won't want to drive in anything else
after tonight.

1054
01:18:20,761 --> 01:18:23,050
- Mind you, it drinks petrol.
- Yes.

1055
01:18:23,347 --> 01:18:25,921
I'm afraid we'll have to stop
on the way into town.

1056
01:18:26,642 --> 01:18:28,718
I feel like Eamonn Andrews.

1057
01:18:28,811 --> 01:18:30,222
- Is that a good thing?
- Eamonn Andrews

1058
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:33,100
is the poshest person
that Jack can imagine being.

1059
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:52,536
- How are you tonight, sir?
- Very well. Might as well fill her up.

1060
01:18:54,128 --> 01:18:56,619
I'm going to make a quick call.
I'll be 2 ticks.

1061
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:07,176
Do you think I should offer
to help pay for the petrol?

1062
01:19:08,392 --> 01:19:09,851
Would he be insulted, do you think?

1063
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:13,303
I know he said tonight was his treat,

1064
01:19:13,397 --> 01:19:15,722
but does that apply to the petrol,
do you think?

1065
01:19:15,816 --> 01:19:17,773
I'm sure it does, Jack.

1066
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,695
- No.
- Jack!

1067
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:28,821
It just came off.

1068
01:19:37,963 --> 01:19:40,122
- Put it on my bill.
- Thank you, sir.

1069
01:19:40,382 --> 01:19:41,924
Cheers.

1070
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,839
Jenny? Jenny.

1071
01:19:47,848 --> 01:19:49,342
Take us home.

1072
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:52,185
- What's wrong?
- I'm afraid there's been...

1073
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:54,226
- Jenny's had a bit of a shock.
- What's happened?

1074
01:19:54,313 --> 01:19:58,891
It's just another one of David's
little muddles and misunderstandings.

1075
01:20:00,235 --> 01:20:02,193
I don't want to hear another word
from anybody. Take us home.

1076
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:03,857
- Now.
- All right.

1077
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,750
You can take care of this,
can't you, David?

1078
01:20:16,835 --> 01:20:18,294
Go inside, Dad.

1079
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:27,214
"Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman."

1080
01:20:27,304 --> 01:20:30,009
"Mr. and Mrs. David..." You're married!

1081
01:20:31,433 --> 01:20:33,141
Legally, yes, but I...

1082
01:20:33,477 --> 01:20:36,050
- When were you going to tell me?
- Soon. It...

1083
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:39,144
It's just never seemed
like the right time.

1084
01:20:43,028 --> 01:20:44,902
You seemed so happy
and I was happy and...

1085
01:20:44,988 --> 01:20:48,108
You were living with your wife
all this time.

1086
01:20:48,659 --> 01:20:50,984
Round the corner! Byron Avenue!

1087
01:20:51,078 --> 01:20:53,201
It's no wonder
we kept bumping into each other, is it?

1088
01:20:53,288 --> 01:20:56,075
- What number?
-34.

1089
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,087
Don't be like this. Come on.

1090
01:21:07,844 --> 01:21:09,588
I have nothing.

1091
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:13,924
I didn't take my exams. I...

1092
01:21:14,017 --> 01:21:15,511
I left school!

1093
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:19,513
Where's it all gone now?

1094
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:22,731
I can get a divorce.

1095
01:21:25,904 --> 01:21:27,731
Everything will turn out for the best.

1096
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:39,493
Go and tell them.

1097
01:21:42,337 --> 01:21:44,828
Go and tell them,
and then go and tell your wife.

1098
01:21:46,174 --> 01:21:47,633
They won't listen now.

1099
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:54,555
All right? I'll come round tomorrow,
when everyone's feeling a bit calmer.

1100
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:56,474
Please don't make me...

1101
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,599
Please don't make me tell them
on my own.

1102
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:01,887
You owe me that much.
You owe them that much.

1103
01:22:02,107 --> 01:22:04,479
I owe them much more than that.

1104
01:22:11,032 --> 01:22:12,527
Hey.

1105
01:22:27,716 --> 01:22:30,551
2 minutes, and then I'll
come out and drag you in.

1106
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,068
What's going on?

1107
01:23:33,865 --> 01:23:36,985
He's helping himself
to some Dutch courage before facing you.

1108
01:23:38,703 --> 01:23:41,159
Stolen Dutch courage,
from the look of it.

1109
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:45,620
He has something he has to tell you.

1110
01:23:57,514 --> 01:23:59,008
He just drove off!

1111
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:07,056
Can you tell us?

1112
01:24:09,442 --> 01:24:11,020
Jenny, please!

1113
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:19,238
I wouldn't worry about it
too much.

1114
01:24:21,871 --> 01:24:23,496
- When I found out...
- Not now, Helen.

1115
01:24:33,424 --> 01:24:35,298
I tried to tell him.

1116
01:24:36,886 --> 01:24:40,718
I'm not speaking to him now,
if that's any consolation.

1117
01:24:43,559 --> 01:24:46,347
It's a funny world you people live in.

1118
01:24:47,563 --> 01:24:49,852
You both watched me
carrying on with a married man

1119
01:24:49,941 --> 01:24:51,768
and you didn't think it was worth
saying anything about it.

1120
01:24:51,859 --> 01:24:53,519
Yes, well,
if you want that conversation...

1121
01:24:54,737 --> 01:24:57,145
You watched David and I
help ourselves to a map

1122
01:24:57,657 --> 01:24:59,317
and you didn't say much, either.

1123
01:25:27,228 --> 01:25:30,846
Come on, you, let's go. Good boy.

1124
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,026
Hello.

1125
01:25:41,367 --> 01:25:44,818
Hello. Sorry, I think I've got the wrong
number. I was looking for my...

1126
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:47,368
I wanted... For my cello lesson.

1127
01:25:51,752 --> 01:25:53,710
No. Don't tell me.

1128
01:25:54,755 --> 01:25:56,298
Good God.

1129
01:25:57,383 --> 01:25:58,842
You're a child.

1130
01:26:02,847 --> 01:26:06,547
You didn't know
about any of this, presumably?

1131
01:26:10,563 --> 01:26:12,271
No. They never do.

1132
01:26:16,777 --> 01:26:20,442
You're not in the family way, are you?
Because that's happened before.

1133
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:27,988
Thank God for that.

1134
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:33,827
No. No. You stay here.

1135
01:26:46,098 --> 01:26:48,589
- Did you see her?
- Yes, I saw her.

1136
01:26:49,685 --> 01:26:51,725
I didn't talk to her.
There wasn't any need.

1137
01:26:51,812 --> 01:26:53,935
We have to have this out.

1138
01:26:55,524 --> 01:26:57,564
Well, if you won't do it, I will.
I'm still your father.

1139
01:26:57,651 --> 01:27:00,439
You're my father again now, are you?
And what were you

1140
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:02,937
when you encouraged me
to throw my life away?

1141
01:27:04,074 --> 01:27:05,818
Silly schoolgirls are always
getting seduced

1142
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:07,819
by glamorous older men.
But what about you two?

1143
01:27:38,525 --> 01:27:40,103
Jenny?

1144
01:27:46,742 --> 01:27:48,320
Jenny.

1145
01:27:52,873 --> 01:27:54,581
Jenny, I'm sorry.

1146
01:28:02,925 --> 01:28:05,676
I know I've made a mess of everything.

1147
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:15,510
All my life I've been scared

1148
01:28:17,356 --> 01:28:19,977
and I didn't want you to be scared.

1149
01:28:22,444 --> 01:28:24,271
That's why I wanted you to go to Oxford.

1150
01:28:26,448 --> 01:28:30,778
And then along came David
and he knew famous writers,

1151
01:28:30,869 --> 01:28:33,407
he knew how to get
to classical music concerts...

1152
01:28:38,794 --> 01:28:41,332
But he wasn't who he said he was.

1153
01:28:44,007 --> 01:28:46,759
He wasn't who you said he was, either.

1154
01:28:52,349 --> 01:28:57,177
The other day, your mother and I
were listening

1155
01:28:57,271 --> 01:29:00,474
to a programme on the radio
about CS Lewis,

1156
01:29:00,566 --> 01:29:04,729
and they said
that he'd moved to Cambridge in 1954.

1157
01:29:08,824 --> 01:29:11,611
I said, "Well they've got that wrong."

1158
01:29:14,621 --> 01:29:17,077
Our Jenny wouldn't have his name
in her book

1159
01:29:19,251 --> 01:29:21,409
if he'd moved to Cambridge.

1160
01:29:31,054 --> 01:29:33,343
There's a cup of tea
and some biscuits out here.

1161
01:30:07,215 --> 01:30:09,504
How do you think we can help?

1162
01:30:11,928 --> 01:30:15,760
I want to repeat my last year at school
and take my exams.

1163
01:30:17,225 --> 01:30:21,603
I got the impression last time we spoke
that you didn't see the point of school,

1164
01:30:21,688 --> 01:30:23,846
or of me, or of any of us here.

1165
01:30:24,441 --> 01:30:26,065
I know. I was stupid.

1166
01:30:26,943 --> 01:30:30,277
The life I want, there's no shortcut.

1167
01:30:31,865 --> 01:30:34,700
I know now
that I need to go to university.

1168
01:30:36,036 --> 01:30:38,953
It gives me absolutely
no pleasure whatsoever

1169
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:42,158
to see our young schoolgirls
throwing their lives away.

1170
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:45,913
Although, of course, you are not
one of our schoolgirls any more.

1171
01:30:46,004 --> 01:30:47,463
Through your own volition.

1172
01:30:48,465 --> 01:30:50,504
I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman.

1173
01:30:53,303 --> 01:30:55,295
You're not a woman.

1174
01:30:56,848 --> 01:30:59,469
No, I'm afraid I think
that the offer of a place at this school

1175
01:30:59,559 --> 01:31:01,552
would be wasted on you.

1176
01:31:27,253 --> 01:31:28,878
Come in.

1177
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:33,379
I didn't expect to see you again.

1178
01:31:41,309 --> 01:31:42,803
This is lovely.

1179
01:31:43,686 --> 01:31:45,870
All your books and pictures and...

1180
01:31:48,024 --> 01:31:50,515
Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.

1181
01:31:51,694 --> 01:31:53,237
That's all you need, isn't it?

1182
01:31:56,616 --> 01:31:58,490
Just somewhere to...

1183
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:11,578
I'm sorry I said those silly things.
I didn't understand.

1184
01:32:16,052 --> 01:32:17,961
Let's forget about it.

1185
01:32:26,521 --> 01:32:30,649
- A Burne-Jones.
- Do you like him?

1186
01:32:30,733 --> 01:32:33,022
I do. Still.

1187
01:32:35,196 --> 01:32:38,814
"Still"? You sound very old and wise.

1188
01:32:42,078 --> 01:32:45,411
I feel old, but not very wise.

1189
01:32:51,379 --> 01:32:52,873
Miss Stubbs, I need your help.

1190
01:32:59,262 --> 01:33:02,013
I was so hoping
that's what you were going to say.

1191
01:33:52,732 --> 01:33:54,523
Thank you, Marjorie.

1192
01:34:09,874 --> 01:34:11,534
It's from Oxford.

1193
01:34:46,744 --> 01:34:48,820
"It is my pleasure to inform you

1194
01:34:48,913 --> 01:34:54,868
"that your application to read English
at Oxford has been accepted.

1195
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,119
"On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,

1196
01:34:57,213 --> 01:35:01,293
"the staff of the university
look forward to welcoming you..."

1197
01:35:20,277 --> 01:35:22,947
So I went to read English books,

1198
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:25,236
and did my best
to avoid the speccy, spotty fate

1199
01:35:25,324 --> 01:35:27,862
that Helen had predicted for me.

1200
01:35:27,952 --> 01:35:32,863
I probably looked as wide-eyed,
fresh and artless as any other student.

1201
01:35:33,749 --> 01:35:35,243
But I wasn't.

1202
01:35:37,044 --> 01:35:38,669
One of the boys I went out with,

1203
01:35:38,754 --> 01:35:40,296
and they really were boys,

1204
01:35:40,673 --> 01:35:43,709
once asked me to go to Paris with him.

1205
01:35:43,801 --> 01:35:48,546
And I told him I'd love to,
I was dying to see Paris,

1206
01:35:49,848 --> 01:35:51,722
as if I'd never been.
