1
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,735
Sit down, dear.

2
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,001
This one is Swiss by nationality.

3
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:54,525
Two years employment here in London as a Governess...

4
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,081
piano, drawing, French, of course.

5
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,951
How old are you, dear?
Twenty two.

6
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:06,537
Are you in good health?
Yes.

7
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:10,957
Are both your parents still living?
My mother is dead.

8
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:13,502
What was the cause of your mother's death, dear?

9
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,691
She died in childbirth.

10
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:20,540
Ask her to stand.
Stand up, dear.

11
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:26,149
Turn around.

12
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,694
All the way.

13
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,857
Ask her what the money's for.

14
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:39,276
Her father is in debt, it seems.

15
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:43,656
Does she have any other income,
any other way of making money?

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,210
Sit down, dear.

17
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:51,955
The gentleman asks, do you have no other
way to raise the sum that you need?

18
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:54,958
Does the gentleman have any suggestions?

19
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:57,794
My dear, you're very pretty. You could marry, you know.

20
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:01,006
Yes, I could sell myself for life.

21
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,062
The gentleman's needs, as I understand it,
are of a shorter duration.

22
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:10,348
Has she done this before?

23
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:13,841
The gentleman asks...
Can the gentleman ask for himself?

24
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:18,606
You're not to know who he is, my dear.
No one is to know.

25
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,650
He need not tell me his name.

26
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:24,831
I would like to hear his voice.

27
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,712
What can you tell from a voice?

28
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:36,206
A little.

29
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,126
Have you ever done anything like this before?

30
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,316
No never.

31
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,187
Will you do it?

32
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,296
Of course. Why else am I here?

33
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,779
Shall I look further?

34
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:03,201
No, this is the one.

35
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,375
Anything else, sir?

36
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:45,490
Is everything to your liking, madam?
Yes thank you.

37
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:24,590
Excuse me, but there is a message for me?

38
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,467
No, Miss, no.
Good.

39
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,971
If anything, I'm in my room.

40
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,744
Yes, Miss.
Thank you.

41
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:02,207
I hope you don't mind, I didn't want
to be seen entering the room with you.

42
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:11,402
I'm afraid I can't introduce myself, as you know.

43
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,154
Yes.

44
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:17,168
Did you have a smooth crossing?
For the most part.

45
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:21,047
Is the hotel to your liking?
I have no complaints.

46
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:23,237
Please.

47
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:29,263
It's of the utmost importance that
we're not seen together in public...

48
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,693
over these next few days.

49
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:38,241
I have a reputation to protect,
not just for myself, but for others.

50
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:52,827
Do you understand?
Yes.

51
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:56,498
We'll meet together each evening
after dinner here in your room.

52
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:58,687
As you wish.

53
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,764
Are we to...

54
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:06,987
to meet this evening?

55
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:11,314
Yes, We only have three evenings.

56
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,276
When are we to begin?

57
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:20,562
I thought you might like a little time to accustom yourself.

58
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:23,565
I have accustomed myself.

59
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,755
I'm ready now.

60
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,423
The fire gives more light than one expects.

61
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,612
Does it trouble you?

62
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:53,938
No.

63
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,567
Will this do?

64
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,322
Yes.

65
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:54,341
Perhaps you think I'm no better than him.

66
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,617
I think nothing.

67
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,370
You think what we're doing is wrong?

68
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:14,360
You at least...are doing it for someone else.

69
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:20,678
I, too, have a duty to someone else.

70
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,966
Then, sir, since neither of us are here for our own pleasure

71
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,938
perhaps what we do isn't so very wrong.

72
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:15,439
I don't want to know your name.
I don't want to know anything about you.

73
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:44,123
Aren't you afraid to be seen with me?

74
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:46,594
There is no one to see.

75
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,171
I like it here.

76
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:53,090
Just sea and sky and...

77
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:55,280
And nothing.

78
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:59,263
I like it.

79
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,839
Makes me want to shout.
Then shout.

80
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,716
No, it's not so easy.

81
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:37,164
You're very...

82
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:44,608
I didn't expect it to be like this.

83
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:50,197
What did you expect?

84
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:55,827
Last night...

85
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,624
I thought...

86
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,963
For a moment I thought that...

87
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,800
You thought that I liked it?

88
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,264
Did you?

89
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:19,225
No.

90
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,859
But I could.

91
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,055
Oh, I wish...

92
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,183
What do you wish?

93
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,729
I wish I could shout.

94
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:47,966
So, Mrs.Jago will see to everything when the time comes.

95
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:50,677
Yes, I know it all.

96
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,941
We made an arrangement.
I accept it.

97
00:15:56,944 --> 00:16:00,270
You won't want to be seen disembarking in my company.

98
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,251
Uh, no.

99
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,997
Goodbye, then.

100
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:54,124
Over soon, my dear.

101
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:21,389
It's a little girl. Is she all there?

102
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:23,777
Oh, yes, she's beautiful.

103
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:27,823
Best to take her away at once.

104
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,703
There, my pet. All over now.

105
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,693
I don't even know your name.

106
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:20,243
Happy birthday, darling.

107
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,667
I don't forget you.

108
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,701
You are ready?

109
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,986
Madames, messieurs. Give me your bodies, give me your souls.

110
00:19:33,987 --> 00:19:36,072
And let's dance the Polka.

111
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,519
That is it.

112
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:47,248
Make a window with your legs.

113
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,461
Move from the waist.

114
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:55,496
Ladies, trust your gentlemen.

115
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,833
In the Polka, faith is the virtue that saves.

116
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:02,961
Shame on you, Mr.Godwin. Not dancing?

117
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:06,068
You'll have to excuse me, Mrs.Hurst.
I'm afraid I don't know the steps.

118
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:10,479
None of us know the steps, Mr.Godwin.
That's the fun of it. We learn together.

119
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:15,046
As you can see, I'm not dressed for dancing.

120
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:20,363
Jenny, I want you. I shall have you.
Oh!

121
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,862
Seen enough?
You have to admit it's quite a sight.

122
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,260
Quite a cost too.

123
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,972
From the waist.

124
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,359
There's the old monster.

125
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,458
Want to meet him?
Surely.

126
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,815
The lady with him isn't exactly his wife.

127
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:50,809
You don't exactly surprise me. Just the latest in a long line.

128
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:59,140
Father, I'd like to introduce you to...
You're not dressed, Charles.

129
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:00,954
Go and get dressed.

130
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,427
Father.
You're a blot, boy.

131
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:07,690
Father, may I introduce to you Mr.John Taylor of Ohio?

132
00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:11,850
My father, Lord Clare.
Miss Holland.

133
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:16,584
And what brings you all the way from Ohio, sir?

134
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,537
Your son and I hope to do business together.

135
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,592
What business?
I'm a sheep farmer.

136
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,095
A sheep farmer.

137
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:33,517
Get dressed, Charles, or get out. There's a good fellow.

138
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:40,201
I wouldn't have missed that for the world.

139
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:42,932
I wish I could laugh.

140
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:46,394
But my father's London life all has to be paid for.

141
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:49,272
We don't live like this down in the country.

142
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:52,567
The boy's not normal. Don't ask me why.

143
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,236
Don't be hard on him, Jimmy.

144
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,072
When you think of his poor wife.

145
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:00,324
Damn it, Molly, that was ten years ago.

146
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:03,424
You'd think he'd have found some
comfort of a female variety by now,

147
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:05,371
but he won't do it.

148
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:08,300
Are you sure?
Quite sure. The boy's not normal.

149
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:12,127
Brought this fellow over from Paris, you know.

150
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,796
First Polka in London.

151
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,518
Come on, Molly. Let's hop.

152
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:25,281
You'd be the new Governess.
Yes.

153
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:28,117
Know about the child, do you, Miss?

154
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:30,306
I know what I've been told.

155
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:33,330
Left in a basket on the steps of the Ram Inn.

156
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:35,520
They tell you that?

157
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,044
No.
No.

158
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:42,047
They don't tell them that.

159
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:45,425
I don't suppose you could put
something on the fire, could you?

160
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:50,107
Can't bend, Miss. Wig falls off.

161
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,192
Please to come with me, Miss.

162
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,529
You will be the fourth this year, Miss.

163
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:10,032
The fourth Governess?
They don't stay.

164
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:12,451
Miss Louisa sees to that.

165
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,641
Louisa?

166
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:19,176
The Governess' room.

167
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,255
Thomas will bring your trunk up when he has time.

168
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,466
£25 a year, is it, your pay?

169
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:30,656
The cook gets £30,

170
00:24:32,147 --> 00:24:34,232
Schoolroom this way.

171
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,767
We don't get many like you at Selcombe, Miss.

172
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:40,019
Like what?
Foreigners, Miss.

173
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:42,209
We're all English here.

174
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,618
The classroom.

175
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:52,656
Know about Miss Louisa, do you, Miss?

176
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,138
She was left in a basket on the steps of the Ram Inn.
Don't you believe it.

177
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:59,548
Master bought her from a gypsy for half a crown.

178
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:05,878
Thinks she's quite a little lady, but she don't fool me.

179
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:09,109
Where is she now?

180
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:10,955
I would not know, Miss.

181
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:13,250
Maybe the gypsies have took her back.

182
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,602
Excuse me. Where would I find Miss Louisa, please?

183
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:24,791
Oh, she'll be in her lake house.

184
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,116
She's always hiding in there.

185
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,808
Who are you?

186
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,522
Miss Laurier, your new Governess.

187
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,543
You're not English, are you?

188
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,995
No.
Do you speak English?

189
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,582
Yes.

190
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,195
Then bugger away, lady.

191
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,614
I see you found your way to Louisa's lake house.

192
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:32,774
Yes.
And she ran away from you, I suppose?

193
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,330
Yes.
That's what she does.

194
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm afraid her father's not very
strict with her, as you'll discover.

195
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,503
As you will discover.

196
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:45,964
Mr.Godwin is not at home?

197
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:49,300
He's in town at present. We expect him back tomorrow.

198
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:49,300
He's in town right now. We expect him back tomorrow.

199
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,698
Mrs.Godwin?
Oh, no.

200
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,128
No.

201
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,872
No. I'm not Mrs.Godwin.

202
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,187
My sister, Amelia, married Charles.

203
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:05,316
So, she is Mrs.Godwin.

204
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,067
But shortly after her marriage

205
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:10,405
she had a serious accident, a riding accident.

206
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:12,823
Charles had no one to run the house for him.

207
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:15,982
So I came.
Thank you.

208
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,592
And, uh, Mrs.Godwin?

209
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,846
Amy didn't die.

210
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,954
Her life is over, but she lives on.

211
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,053
And here we are, Charles and I...

212
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:38,983
and Amy and Louisa.

213
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:32,576
We are home!

214
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:45,339
Did you have a pleasant journey?
Yes.

215
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:49,478
John Taylor, this is my sister-in-law, Miss Skelton.

216
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:52,439
Mr.Taylor, welcome.
Mrs.Skelton.

217
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:56,339
There was no need for you to walk down, John.
The carriage would've brought you.

218
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:59,571
I'm not an old man yet, Charles.
Ellen, will you help Louisa with her cloak?

219
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,761
I was waiting for you.
Would you take Mr.Taylor's coat?

220
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:04,565
John, this is a man you have to meet. Mr.Ames, my farmer.

221
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:08,194
Mr.Taylor.
Mr.Ames.

222
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,633
Do you have any experience with Southdowns, sir?

223
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:24,387
Not yet. We run merinos.
Ah, wait till you bring in the Southdowns.

224
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:26,076
There's no heartier breed in existence.

225
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,038
We have a new Governess, Charles.
Another one?

226
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:31,143
Send Miss Laurier down to meet Master.

227
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:32,917
Thomas, will you come with me?

228
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,001
Look at this girl.

229
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:39,255
She's so frightening, all the Governesses
run from her squealing.

230
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,851
How do you do that, Louisa? Hm?

231
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:47,471
I don't want a Governess.
You don't want a Governess.

232
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,431
Did you miss me?
No.

233
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:53,331
You must give me some breeding tips, Mr.Ames.
I mean to win prizes.

234
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:57,137
Mr.Godwin's your man. He's our master breeder.

235
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:59,206
You have to be careful,John.

236
00:31:59,311 --> 00:32:02,527
This breeding business can become
something of an obsession.

237
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:06,250
It's nothing less than the endless pursuit of perfection.

238
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:11,661
How close do you reckon you've got? To perfection, I mean.

239
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:15,999
The Selcombe flock is as good as you'll find, sir.

240
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,209
That's what I hear.

241
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,878
What's your secret?

242
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,839
Ah, here's the new Governess.

243
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:28,427
Uh, this is my brother-in-law, Mr.Godwin. Miss Laurier.

244
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,617
Mr.Godwin.

245
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,903
Miss Laurier is from Switzerland.

246
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:38,302
but she's been employed in England for many years.

247
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,327
I see.

248
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:53,170
I'm sure Mr.Taylor needs a drink. I know I do.

249
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:06,774
You must leave at once.

250
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:09,925
What are you doing?
And what on earth possessed you to come here?

251
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,052
It's taken me seven years to trace my child.

252
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:13,826
Do not ask me to leave her now.

253
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:16,703
We had an agreement. You had your money.

254
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:19,328
I didn't know how it would be when she was born.

255
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,270
All I heard was her cry. I've never forgotten it.

256
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,939
You were paid to forget.
I tried.

257
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,149
You tried?

258
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,528
I'd give you back your money if I could.
I don't want the money.

259
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,344
It wasn't for me. It was for my...it was for my father.

260
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:38,130
He was in prison and...I don't want to hear this. I just...

261
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:44,333
I wanted an heir. I wanted a child. Is that so wrong?

262
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:47,837
I swear to you, no one will ever learn
the truth from me, not even Louisa.

263
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:51,090
Not even Louisa, not even your own daughter.
You couldn't live with that.

264
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:54,176
I have no choice. I have no home of my own.

265
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:57,325
I must be Governess to her or nothing.
She hates Governesses.

266
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,807
She needs me.
That's enough.

267
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:02,872
No. No. It's impossible, the whole thing. You must go.

268
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:04,801
And there's the end to it.

269
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:13,226
Ah, yes. Because you have to put the paddles up.

270
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,136
We'll have to get another Governess, Connie.
Miss Laurier can't stay.

271
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:19,534
Why?

272
00:34:20,587 --> 00:34:22,641
Louisa doesn't like her.

273
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:26,509
Oh, Charles! Louisa doesn't like any Governess.

274
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:31,097
Can't a man choose who's to educate his own daughter?

275
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:35,987
Do you wish her to be dismissed without a character?
No.

276
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:39,835
Well, then, she must be given at least a month's notice.

277
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:44,266
A month? Can't she just be paid?

278
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,185
Governesses make their homes with their employers.

279
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,220
She can't leave until she's found a new situation.

280
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:55,423
A month? A month is an eternity.

281
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:59,635
Does she really have no home but this?
That's why Governesses are Governesses.

282
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:03,472
What happens to them when they aren't
wanted as Governesses any more?

283
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:05,297
I really don't know.

284
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:12,637
All these huge rooms, and we live our lives
within three feet of the fire.

285
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,751
Would you come with me, please?

286
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,156
You're to have one month's notice.

287
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:39,788
You said you'd swear to tell no one.
Yes.

288
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:49,579
Oh! Thank you, Hannah.

289
00:35:49,683 --> 00:35:52,144
Have I time for my tea, sir?
Yes.

290
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:55,094
I'll stay till you return.
Thank you, sir.

291
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,225
Amy, I've brought someone to see you.

292
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:05,646
This is Miss Laurel.
Please.

293
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:14,686
This is my wife, Amelia.

294
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,428
Mrs.Godwin.

295
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:25,415
I tell Amy everything.

296
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:33,079
She knows Louisa's my daughter.

297
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:36,634
But I promised her that I'll never shame her before the world.

298
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,263
No one else knows but you.

299
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:46,477
Does she understand what we say?
I choose to believe that she does.

300
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:54,579
If there's any pity in you for my wife's wasted life...

301
00:36:55,204 --> 00:36:58,155
swear that you'll keep our secret.

302
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:05,412
I swear.

303
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,296
Now leave us.

304
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:26,156
Good morning, Louise.

305
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,090
Do you know your ABC? Do you know your ABC?

306
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:56,936
This is "L" for Louisa.

307
00:38:58,354 --> 00:39:01,524
This is "L" for Louisa.

308
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,694
Don't go. We have work to do.

309
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:10,282
Don't go. We have work to do.

310
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:19,666
You are poor, I suppose.
Yes.

311
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,711
I don't have to do what you say.

312
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:36,995
No.
You got to hoist them off.

313
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:40,968
Bugger away, lady. Bugger away. Gently now.

314
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:42,886
Come on.
Do you see why?

315
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,680
Frankly, I don't. They all look good to me.

316
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:47,724
You've a superb flock here.

317
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:51,811
Well, I should have. I've been breeding
the imperfections out for 15 years.

318
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,230
This one's a perfect breeding ewe.

319
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:57,296
See how the chine runs straight from the
nape of the neck to the sitting of the tail.

320
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,404
Good wide hips, straight forelegs,
plenty of wool between the ears.

321
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:04,782
Look into her eyes sweet, gentle disposition.

322
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:07,639
She'll feed well, fatten well and lamb well.

323
00:40:07,743 --> 00:40:09,933
Go on.
Good morning, Miss Laurier.

324
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:11,704
Mr.Taylor.

325
00:40:11,705 --> 00:40:14,635
Have you come to admire the Southdowns too?

326
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:19,421
No, sir. I've come for Mr.Godwin's instructions.

327
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:21,632
Don't you fight, now. Oh.

328
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:24,906
Well? Am I to teach Miss Louisa, sir...

329
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,409
if even only for one month?
Yes.

330
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:31,266
Then I must be able to keep her in the schoolroom.

331
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,831
What forms of discipline am I permitted to use?

332
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:38,408
None. If her lessons give her no pleasure,
why should she endure them? No.

333
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,841
She'll find out soon enough what a hard world we live in.

334
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:49,043
For these few short years that she's under my care,
I want her to be happy.

335
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:53,548
Is that clear?
Yes sir.

336
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,720
Steady.

337
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:04,715
No.
Fair enough, now?

338
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:08,719
A bit and turn around. Come on.
Turn around. Yeah. That's it.

339
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:11,346
Let me out! I want to see my father! Let me out!

340
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,849
Come on! You gotta let me out! Let me out!

341
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:16,747
I want my pa! Come on! I want my pa!

342
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,562
Let me out now! I want my pa!

343
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,826
Let me out!
After you've done your lessons.

344
00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:28,644
Let me out! I want my pa! Just let me out now!

345
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:31,043
I want him! Hey! Let me out!

346
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:45,441
What's that?
Uh, Miss Louisa, sir, being educated.

347
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:48,152
I hate you!

348
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:55,149
No, I never...never!

349
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,767
Papa!

350
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:03,062
Open the door.
Papa! Papa!

351
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:06,743
Miss Laurier, open this door at once!

352
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:15,637
What do you think you're doing? Open the door!

353
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,410
No sir.

354
00:42:20,214 --> 00:42:24,083
Please, Papa. Come here, please!

355
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:26,867
I will not have you treat my daughter like this.

356
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:29,579
Would you have her grow up ignorant and friendless?

357
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,193
I'll not have her imprisoned.

358
00:42:31,194 --> 00:42:33,571
She cares for no one but you, and so no one cares for her.

359
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,969
Give me the key.
She is unhappy and lonely.

360
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:39,650
She doesn't know who she is or what she is to do or why.

361
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,947
Papa, help me! Papa, I want you!

362
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:59,585
I can help her. I know I can.

363
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,589
But first she has to be taught to obey me.

364
00:43:06,175 --> 00:43:08,834
If you harm so much as one hair on her head...

365
00:43:08,938 --> 00:43:12,494
Do you think I, of all people, would ever hurt her?

366
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:18,009
I'll make you a promise.

367
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:21,231
Whatever I do to Louisa, I'll do to myself.

368
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,468
You want her to love you. I want her to be loved.

369
00:43:31,658 --> 00:43:33,952
She won't have you forever.

370
00:43:46,297 --> 00:43:48,382
Louisa?

371
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:53,554
Louisa, I'll see you when your lessons are over.

372
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:58,350
All right, darling? Louisa?

373
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:01,395
I love you.

374
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,540
Lunch, Miss.
Thank you, Ellen. Put it on the table.

375
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:29,088
Will that be all, Miss?
Yes. Thank you, Ellen.

376
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:37,137
Would you like your lunch?

377
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,778
One,

378
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:57,907
Two.

379
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:06,916
If you won't eat, then neither will I.

380
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:18,792
I'd say you're lucky to have her.
Oh? Why?

381
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:22,306
She's got pride in herself. Doesn't back down.

382
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:28,176
And she's lovely.

383
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,012
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.

384
00:45:31,116 --> 00:45:35,360
Miss Laurier is here to teach Louisa.
She leaves at the end of the month.

385
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:39,604
So you won't mind if I speak to her?

386
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,814
What do you mean, speak to her?

387
00:45:41,918 --> 00:45:46,089
Well, she doesn't seem to have a home of her own.

388
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:50,823
Do you mean to employ her?
Not exactly.

389
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:54,816
I was thinking of marriage.
Marriage?

390
00:45:57,923 --> 00:46:00,009
I could do a lot worse.

391
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:07,068
I leave tomorrow. I don't have that much time.

392
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:09,893
Well, you'd ask her then.

393
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:16,285
I'm cold.
So am I.

394
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:19,413
I hate you.
Hate me if you want,

395
00:46:19,517 --> 00:46:21,331
but you must obey me.

396
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:23,604
I won't. I'll die first.

397
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:26,524
Hm. How will you die?

398
00:46:26,628 --> 00:46:28,943
I'll drown myself in the lake.

399
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:32,175
How will you make your body stay underwater?

400
00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:36,669
It just will.
No, it won't. Bodies float.

401
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,495
You could put stones in your pockets.

402
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,476
Do you have any pockets?
Don't talk to me.

403
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,458
Or you could get a good, strong bag and fill it with pebbles.

404
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:48,952
I said, don't talk to me.
What do you do in the lake house?

405
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,134
If you come near it, I'll kill you.

406
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:56,010
I'll murder you.
How?

407
00:46:56,115 --> 00:46:58,847
With a knife. I'll stab you in the heart.

408
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:02,475
Yes, that would do it.
It would. You'd be dead.

409
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,791
You'd have to bury me.
I won't. I'll just leave you.

410
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:08,397
I'd rot. I'd smell.

411
00:47:08,502 --> 00:47:10,170
Serve you right.

412
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:21,003
What are these stupid lessons anyway?

413
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,715
Louisa...

414
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:28,531
loves Papa.

415
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:34,662
Louisa...loves grass.

416
00:47:35,642 --> 00:47:37,728
Louisa...

417
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:43,024
eats grass.

418
00:47:45,777 --> 00:47:49,551
Sheep eat grass.

419
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:12,907
Papa loves sheep.

420
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:15,722
You see, it's not hard.

421
00:48:20,185 --> 00:48:24,022
Do you know about firelight?
What about it?

422
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:28,068
It's a kind of magic.

423
00:48:29,402 --> 00:48:33,271
Firelight makes time stand still.

424
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:35,481
When you put out the lamps...

425
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:39,193
and sit in the firelight's glow...

426
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:42,164
there aren't any rules any more.

427
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:54,791
You can do what you want, say what you want...

428
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:57,533
be what you want.

429
00:48:58,764 --> 00:49:03,164
And when the lamps are lit again, time starts again.

430
00:49:04,436 --> 00:49:08,054
And everything you said or did is forgotten...

431
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:10,640
more than forgotten.

432
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:13,903
It never happened.

433
00:49:15,446 --> 00:49:18,157
I can do what I want?
Yes.

434
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:22,662
I want to go.
Then go.

435
00:49:24,956 --> 00:49:27,604
It's been unlocked since lunch time.

436
00:50:02,075 --> 00:50:04,160
All right?

437
00:50:05,244 --> 00:50:08,028
To a famous victory.

438
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:11,073
Don't say that. Louisa's too young to be defeated.

439
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:14,117
Oh, well. Then we shall drink to you.

440
00:50:14,222 --> 00:50:17,047
To Miss Laurier.
Miss Laurier.

441
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,420
Governess after Governess has tried
to control Louisa and failed.

442
00:50:25,524 --> 00:50:29,507
Only Miss Laurier has realized that
first she must control Charles.

443
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:33,709
Yes. But look at him. He's not at all grateful.

444
00:50:39,444 --> 00:50:42,071
I understand you'll be leaving in a month.

445
00:50:43,865 --> 00:50:46,941
Where do you go?

446
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,860
Another situation.

447
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:53,363
Then what?
I don't understand.

448
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:57,920
Well, the years go by, you're no longer required, then what?

449
00:50:58,462 --> 00:51:00,839
Do you return to Switzerland?

450
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:06,543
I can't see into the future.

451
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,244
Some say the future is what you make it.

452
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:14,258
Well, in...in America, certainly.

453
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:17,762
In America.
That's what I mean.

454
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,951
In America.

455
00:51:42,755 --> 00:51:44,840
Good night, darling.

456
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:51,179
We've begun now.

457
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:19,947
You asked to see me?

458
00:52:20,051 --> 00:52:24,388
Yes. I wanted a moment alone with you before I go.

459
00:52:24,493 --> 00:52:26,839
Please, have a seat.

460
00:52:30,342 --> 00:52:33,678
Miss Laurier, I won't waste your time.

461
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:40,091
I'm a single man with 5,000 acres to my name.

462
00:52:40,195 --> 00:52:43,302
If you would consider a life in America...

463
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:48,036
I would be proud to take you there, as my wife...

464
00:52:50,111 --> 00:52:53,656
You pay me a very great compliment, sir.

465
00:52:55,658 --> 00:52:58,108
But the answer's no.

466
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:00,454
I'm afraid so.

467
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:06,877
Well. You don't know till you ask.

468
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,589
You're not too disappointed, I think.

469
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:16,855
Well, I hardly know you, so I can't make out
I'll not be able to live without you...

470
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,869
but, well, a man can get his hopes up

471
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,581
pretty high pretty quick.

472
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,635
I'm sorry.

473
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:28,690
Just so I know...

474
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:33,277
Guess I'll be doing something
like this again one of these days.

475
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:38,522
Is it anything I can fix...

476
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:43,068
like my dress or how I talk?

477
00:53:43,172 --> 00:53:45,404
No, Mr.Taylor.

478
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:48,897
Any lady would be fortunate to be courted by you.

479
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:51,837
Any lady but you.

480
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:09,395
Louisa, darling, please.
You promised me.

481
00:54:11,814 --> 00:54:15,432
Louisa, I really can't bear this.
That's why she does it.

482
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:18,686
Damnation, can't I feel for my own child?

483
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,709
Feel for her, Mr.Godwin, but don't pity her.

484
00:54:21,814 --> 00:54:25,202
Louisa, let go. Please.

485
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,584
Go, then. If you want to go, go.

486
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:43,136
Will you be all right, darling?
You don't care, so what does it matter?

487
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:55,377
Now, it's just you and me.

488
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:58,298
Shall we start our lessons?

489
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:04,271
I don't have to do what you say.
You're just a servant.

490
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:06,252
That's enough! Be silent.

491
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:10,193
You will obey me, whether you want to or not.

492
00:55:10,298 --> 00:55:13,738
You will obey me because, poor as I am,
I am placed in authority over you.

493
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:17,993
You will not speak disrespectfully
to me or raise your voice to me.

494
00:55:18,618 --> 00:55:23,248
Servant! Servant! Servant!

495
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:25,437
Servant! Servant! Servant!

496
00:55:25,479 --> 00:55:28,972
Servant! Servant! Servant!

497
00:55:37,897 --> 00:55:39,847
I'm not a servant.
I'm a prisoner.

498
00:55:39,951 --> 00:55:42,433
So will you be when you grow up.

499
00:55:42,537 --> 00:55:45,321
The day you come of age, the gates will close around you

500
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,729
because you are a woman!

501
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:51,191
If you marry, everything you own will
become the property of your husband.

502
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:55,487
If you don't marry, every profession
will be closed to you but one...

503
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:59,574
and that one is a life of loneliness and humiliation.

504
00:55:59,678 --> 00:56:02,035
They lock you up, Louise!

505
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:04,496
But there's one door they can't lock.

506
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,290
They can't imprison your mind...

507
00:56:07,394 --> 00:56:09,709
and that's why I want you to learn to read.

508
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:12,618
I want you to have your own life.

509
00:56:16,226 --> 00:56:19,155
Write and tell me when the Southdowns
start winning all the prizes.

510
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,242
Come and see for yourself.
Maybe I will.

511
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:26,006
Best grazing in the world. $20 an acre. Think about it.

512
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:30,729
Did you find time for that other business?

513
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:33,878
She turned me down.
She turned you down?

514
00:56:33,982 --> 00:56:36,975
Mm. I guess there's somebody else.

515
00:56:37,204 --> 00:56:39,759
Lucky fellow is all I can say.

516
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,668
Bye, Charles.
Bye, John.

517
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:23,373
Don't go.

518
00:57:26,918 --> 00:57:29,410
Constance will be down directly.

519
00:57:29,515 --> 00:57:31,600
As you wish.

520
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:51,014
Mr.Taylor tells me he made you an offer
and, uh, you refused him.

521
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,891
Yes.

522
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,906
The fire gives more light than one expects, doesn't it?

523
00:57:58,532 --> 00:58:00,305
Yes.

524
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:09,230
The fire gives more light than one expects, doesn't it?

525
00:58:14,673 --> 00:58:16,341
Yes.

526
00:58:24,724 --> 00:58:28,895
No lamps lit? What's Jane thinking of?

527
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,665
I don't know how much you want to know.

528
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:01,051
I remember her.

529
00:59:05,263 --> 00:59:07,348
The firelight.

530
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:12,061
I remember her.

531
00:59:16,774 --> 00:59:18,859
too much.

532
01:00:07,072 --> 01:00:08,845
Bee.

533
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:12,515
Tree.

534
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,716
Eye.

535
01:00:15,925 --> 01:00:18,010
See.

536
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:22,691
Pig.

537
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:28,259
Dig. Wig. This is stupid.

538
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:34,703
Bad.

539
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:39,854
Sad.

540
01:00:43,274 --> 01:00:44,932
Happy.

541
01:00:45,036 --> 01:00:47,278
I suppose it's "glad."

542
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:54,034
Mad.
Yes.

543
01:01:06,588 --> 01:01:09,507
When I was young, I had no mother.

544
01:01:10,592 --> 01:01:13,094
She died just after I was born.

545
01:01:14,512 --> 01:01:17,536
I loved my father very much...

546
01:01:17,682 --> 01:01:20,643
but what I wanted most was a mother.

547
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:34,615
The sick lady is not my real mother.

548
01:01:36,408 --> 01:01:40,662
Yes, I know.
My real mother's not sick.

549
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:43,238
Where is she?

550
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,980
It's a secret.

551
01:01:48,586 --> 01:01:52,705
Do you ever see her?
Of course. Every day.

552
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,207
What do you do with her?

553
01:01:57,136 --> 01:01:59,222
Just be with her.

554
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:44,661
Miss Laurier. "See."

555
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:49,864
How do you know she doesn't just read
the pictures rather than the words?

556
01:02:49,968 --> 01:02:53,774
She does.
Oh, yes? That's not really reading.

557
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:56,475
No, it's only pretending...

558
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:59,863
but after a while, the pretense becomes a reality.

559
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,240
I see.

560
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:11,823
Louisa tells me you have some story about firelight.

561
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:13,595
Yes.

562
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:16,494
I tell her firelight is a magic time...

563
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:18,683
when time stands still.

564
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:20,998
Why'd you tell her that?

565
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:23,438
I find it helps.

566
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:26,827
A time with no rules at the end of the day.

567
01:03:34,438 --> 01:03:36,628
I must ask you to help me.

568
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:40,444
How?

569
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:45,407
There was a time...it was a short time...
when we were close, you and I.

570
01:03:47,534 --> 01:03:50,620
Yes?
Do you remember it?

571
01:03:50,954 --> 01:03:52,831
Yes.

572
01:03:57,627 --> 01:04:01,297
Just tell me that time is over and can never come again.

573
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:07,386
You don't answer.

574
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:17,438
What happens when time stands still?

575
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,890
The firelight.

576
01:04:21,994 --> 01:04:24,736
You can do what you want...

577
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:27,896
Say what you want.

578
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,638
Be what you want.

579
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:40,095
When the lamps are lit again...time starts again, but...

580
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:44,495
everything you said or did is forgotten.

581
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:46,997
More than forgotten.

582
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,741
Never happened.

583
01:07:26,453 --> 01:07:30,029
Thank you.
Oh, God, I hate the country!

584
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,094
It's always so damn cold.
Come on, Molly, into the mausoleum.

585
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:34,429
Hello, Connie.
Hello.

586
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:36,848
Terrible journey.
The roads get worse every year.

587
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:39,913
How are you?
Jimmy, who are all these people?

588
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:42,207
Fiddlers.

589
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:46,274
You, more coal on the fire before I freeze to death!

590
01:07:46,378 --> 01:07:49,506
Come on in, Manzini. Herd your fellows in.

591
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,676
We can't have a dance without music, Connie.
Everyone knows that.

592
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,678
Dance?
Fire!

593
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:58,150
Can't bend, mi lord. Wig falls off.

594
01:07:58,734 --> 01:08:00,923
Father.
Yes, yes. Here I am.

595
01:08:00,975 --> 01:08:03,936
Hello there, little Missy. Who are all these people?

596
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,835
Christmas cheer. What is it about this house?

597
01:08:06,939 --> 01:08:09,473
The moment I walk in, I want to kill myself.

598
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:12,966
Damn it, boy, don't preach at me.

599
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,239
You do realize we have to sell one of the farms?

600
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:18,867
Never sell land, Charles.
The one sensible thing my father ever said to me.

601
01:08:18,972 --> 01:08:21,537
Why borrow money if all you mean is to give it back?

602
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:23,831
Where's Molly? She can't still be dressing.

603
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,978
Are there any more charges on the estate?
Well, what do I know?

604
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,168
I'm not a bank clerk. I just live my life.

605
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:30,921
All for the sake of a few short years of passing pleasure.

606
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:34,674
Passing pleasures are all we have, boy.
All we have between us and the grave.

607
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:38,345
Hello. Who are you?
This is Miss Laurier.

608
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:41,097
This is, uh, my father, Lord Clare.

609
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,892
Miss Laurier is Louisa's Governess.

610
01:08:43,996 --> 01:08:47,165
Never had Governesses like you in my day.
What are you, French?

611
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,480
No, I'm from Switzerland.

612
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:53,401
Sacrifice your life if you want, Charles. I mean to enjoy mine.

613
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,164
Miss Laurier, is it? Do you Polka?

614
01:09:27,068 --> 01:09:30,989
Well done, Charles. She is lovely.

615
01:09:31,698 --> 01:09:35,076
What?
Your Swiss Governess.

616
01:09:35,514 --> 01:09:39,434
Oh. Yes.
She's an excellent teacher.

617
01:09:40,248 --> 01:09:42,333
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

618
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:47,327
Connie?
Yes, yes.

619
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:49,413
What do you say to a quick turn around the room?

620
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:51,175
Why not?

621
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:06,200
Oh! Oh, Lord Clare, are you all right?

622
01:10:06,304 --> 01:10:08,660
Of course I'm all right.
I'm so sorry. Was it me?

623
01:10:08,765 --> 01:10:10,954
I'll see to him, Miss Laurier.
Please don't trouble yourself.

624
01:10:11,038 --> 01:10:13,290
Look, I tell you, I'm all right. I want to dance, damn it.

625
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:14,989
Why didn't you say?

626
01:10:24,248 --> 01:10:27,616
I never thought I'd get you onto a dance floor, Charles.

627
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,171
There's a first time for everything.

628
01:12:30,369 --> 01:12:32,788
You sent for me, sir?

629
01:12:34,582 --> 01:12:37,574
Well, are you or aren't you?

630
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,171
Am I what?
Diddling Charles.

631
01:12:43,465 --> 01:12:45,916
Molly says you are.

632
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,710
She can usually spot these things, you know.

633
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:51,390
You judge everyone by yourself, sir?

634
01:12:53,809 --> 01:12:55,967
Well, at least you understand what I'm talking about.

635
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,261
You're not gonna sue him or anything, are you?

636
01:12:59,606 --> 01:13:02,400
No.
And you're wrong, Missy.

637
01:13:03,318 --> 01:13:07,363
I don't judge everyone by myself, least of all Charles.

638
01:13:08,072 --> 01:13:11,179
I know he's not like me 'cause he's just like my father.

639
01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:15,371
The old bastard never thought much of me.

640
01:13:16,706 --> 01:13:18,999
Duty this, duty that.

641
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:23,462
And now Charles.

642
01:13:26,173 --> 01:13:29,656
Odd to have your own son acting like your father, you know.

643
01:13:32,638 --> 01:13:35,171
He must have been a child once.

644
01:13:35,276 --> 01:13:38,101
But of course he was a child once.

645
01:13:41,855 --> 01:13:43,940
Well, you're right there.

646
01:13:46,442 --> 01:13:49,904
When he was a little fellow. I'd forgotten that.

647
01:13:52,031 --> 01:13:54,383
You know, when Charles was about 16 years old,

648
01:13:54,488 --> 01:13:58,193
he stood up before me and he said...
Father, I can't respect for a man

649
01:13:58,298 --> 01:14:00,216
which lives only his own pleasure.

650
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,323
You know what I answered?
What?

651
01:14:03,428 --> 01:14:06,222
My boy, you've no right to speak to your father like that...

652
01:14:06,326 --> 01:14:09,027
until you've got yourself well and truly fucked.

653
01:14:09,715 --> 01:14:13,677
Well...now he has.

654
01:14:19,891 --> 01:14:21,977
Good for you, Missy.

655
01:14:23,311 --> 01:14:25,084
Good for you.

656
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:30,985
And you're right, of course.

657
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:35,573
He's my boy.

658
01:15:46,057 --> 01:15:50,291
She pretends she has a mother there.
I know. We're all pretending.

659
01:15:51,959 --> 01:15:56,600
When you come into a room,
I pretend that I haven't noticed you.

660
01:15:56,912 --> 01:16:01,551
And then I look, and there's nothing in the world but you.

661
01:16:04,784 --> 01:16:07,724
Sometimes I think, "Why don't we just go away?"

662
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:11,874
You, me, Louisa.
Would you come with me?

663
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:15,680
Why ask?
It's only pretending.

664
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:19,204
You can't leave.
I don't think I can bear it.

665
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:23,604
You have your duty to your estate,
to your family, to your wife.

666
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:26,211
How can you be so calm?

667
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,192
Not calm.

668
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:39,275
Stay with me tonight.
All night.

669
01:17:52,262 --> 01:17:54,180
Louise!

670
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,205
Come back!
It is not safe!

671
01:18:00,895 --> 01:18:03,502
Louisa, don't leave me!

672
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:20,055
Sleep, darling. Sleep.

673
01:19:52,419 --> 01:19:54,713
I'll never leave you.

674
01:19:55,672 --> 01:19:57,445
Never.

675
01:20:47,805 --> 01:20:49,891
They're making an inventory.

676
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:54,593
Charles left for town at first light.

677
01:20:54,698 --> 01:20:57,607
Mr.Dodds tells me the estate is to be sold.

678
01:21:04,363 --> 01:21:07,053
I wonder what will become of us all.

679
01:21:08,575 --> 01:21:12,892
Who knows? Maybe it's for the best.

680
01:21:14,373 --> 01:21:17,282
Sometimes this house feels like a prison.

681
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:20,337
Mr.Godwin loves it very much.

682
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:23,006
Yes, he did once.

683
01:21:25,175 --> 01:21:28,824
But the house died the day, Amy...

684
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:31,201
didn't die.

685
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:35,268
I wish she had died.

686
01:21:35,977 --> 01:21:38,062
Does that shock you?

687
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:41,399
No.

688
01:21:44,026 --> 01:21:48,603
There's a law, of course, that forbids a man...

689
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:51,658
from marrying his deceased wife's sister.

690
01:21:52,117 --> 01:21:55,047
But it's an absurd law, so easily evaded.

691
01:21:55,151 --> 01:21:59,520
You think if Mrs.Godwin were to die,
you and Mr.Godwin would marry?

692
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:08,237
I don't pretend he loves me as he loved Amy.

693
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:14,034
But ten years is a long time.

694
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,519
We've grown older together.

695
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:22,855
There's a kind of closeness in that.

696
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:37,411
Fire?

697
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,587
God.

698
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:57,148
Hat.
What's that word?

699
01:22:57,253 --> 01:23:00,422
Hat.
How do you know?

700
01:23:00,527 --> 01:23:03,133
Because of the picture.


701
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:10,088
How do I know?

702
01:23:59,031 --> 01:24:01,794
Charles, you're back.
Hello, Connie.

703
01:24:01,898 --> 01:24:05,756
Is everything going to be all right?
No.

704
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,873
Nothing's going to be all right.

705
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:14,108
Are there so very many debts?

706
01:24:15,839 --> 01:24:17,715
Yes.

707
01:24:19,425 --> 01:24:22,564
Yes, the damage is well and truly done.

708
01:24:22,668 --> 01:24:25,098
The estate will have to go.

709
01:24:27,266 --> 01:24:29,352
Oh, Charles.

710
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,928
I am so sorry.

711
01:24:33,032 --> 01:24:35,806
But it's not right. Something should be done.

712
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,767
No, it's not right...

713
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:41,509
but nothing will be done.


714
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:49,121
What will become of us?

715
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:54,626
Who knows?

716
01:25:18,857 --> 01:25:21,256
It's a cold night, Amy.

717
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:24,446
Bitter cold.

718
01:25:25,489 --> 01:25:28,784
I've often thought that this is a kind of prison for you...

719
01:25:31,641 --> 01:25:36,249
and that if you could speak, you'd ask me to...

720
01:25:41,463 --> 01:25:44,278
You'd ask me to let you go.

721
01:25:45,925 --> 01:25:48,740
I have to know that you want it.

722
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:03,296
Show me what you want, Amy.

723
01:26:09,615 --> 01:26:12,221
Show me what you want.

724
01:27:39,826 --> 01:27:43,246
Lord, from you we come, to you we must return.

725
01:27:50,336 --> 01:27:52,818
Take my beloved wife.

726
01:28:46,765 --> 01:28:49,591
Sometime in the night, I'd say.

727
01:28:49,695 --> 01:28:51,916
It was a very cold night.

728
01:28:55,315 --> 01:28:58,256
I understand that the fire had gone out.

729
01:28:59,403 --> 01:29:01,279
Yes.

730
01:29:01,571 --> 01:29:04,230
That was unfortunate.

731
01:29:04,334 --> 01:29:07,734
It wasn't me, sir. I swear on the Good Book.

732
01:29:07,838 --> 01:29:09,715
Nobody's blaming you, Hannah.

733
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:13,645
It's been ten years.

734
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:18,775
At least now she's at peace.
Indeed.

735
01:29:21,632 --> 01:29:23,718
Indeed.

736
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,558
I think we should leave.

737
01:30:16,518 --> 01:30:20,480
You haven't eaten.
No, I...

738
01:30:23,775 --> 01:30:26,226
Are you all right, Charles?

739
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:29,072
Am I all right?
Yes, I think so.

740
01:30:35,703 --> 01:30:38,310
I loved Amy dearly...

741
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:42,460
But I know...

742
01:30:45,213 --> 01:30:48,028
I know that this is for the best.

743
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,888
You really believe that?

744
01:30:55,222 --> 01:30:57,308
Yes, I do.

745
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,054
Dear Connie.

746
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:07,359
You've been good to me all these years.

747
01:31:10,237 --> 01:31:13,021
And you've been good to me, Charles.

748
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:16,722
So much is changing.
What's to become of us all?

749
01:31:18,953 --> 01:31:21,769
As your friend Mr.Taylor said...

750
01:31:22,707 --> 01:31:25,251
The future is what we make of it.

751
01:31:49,274 --> 01:31:51,922
I'm sorry.
No, don't speak.

752
01:31:52,652 --> 01:31:54,738
I...

753
01:31:56,197 --> 01:31:59,367
didn't mean...
Well, it's just a mistake, that's all.

754
01:32:03,871 --> 01:32:06,791
Uh, sorry to have disturbed you.

755
01:32:11,879 --> 01:32:13,964
Connie.

756
01:32:16,717 --> 01:32:18,802
Yes, Charles?

757
01:32:26,727 --> 01:32:29,354
You know how much I loved her, don't you?

758
01:32:31,273 --> 01:32:33,358
Yes, Charles, I do.

759
01:32:41,908 --> 01:32:46,100
Behold, I show you a mystery.

760
01:32:47,246 --> 01:32:51,532
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed...

761
01:32:51,636 --> 01:32:55,119
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye...

762
01:32:55,223 --> 01:32:57,339
at the last trump.

763
01:32:58,466 --> 01:33:00,415
For the trumpet shall sound...

764
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,919
and the dead shall be raised incorruptible...

765
01:33:04,023 --> 01:33:06,671
And we shall be changed.

766
01:33:06,776 --> 01:33:10,884
For this corruptible must put on incorruption...

767
01:33:10,988 --> 01:33:13,720
and this mortal must put on...

768
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,432
immortality.

769
01:33:16,535 --> 01:33:20,351
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption...

770
01:33:20,455 --> 01:33:24,021
and this mortal shall have put on immortality...

771
01:33:24,126 --> 01:33:26,565
then shall be brought to pass

772
01:33:26,566 --> 01:33:29,069
the saying that is written...

773
01:33:29,172 --> 01:33:33,249
Death is swallowed up in victory.

774
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:37,284
O death, where is thy sting?

775
01:33:37,388 --> 01:33:41,799
O grave, where is thy victory?

776
01:34:07,991 --> 01:34:10,076
Does he love you?

777
01:34:13,121 --> 01:34:14,997
Yes.

778
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,200
Do you love him?

779
01:34:20,305 --> 01:34:22,181
Yes.

780
01:34:25,674 --> 01:34:28,364
I would have made him happy.

781
01:34:33,056 --> 01:34:35,434
Love him for me too.

782
01:35:03,711 --> 01:35:05,588
Was it you?

783
01:35:08,549 --> 01:35:10,113
Yes.

784
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:47,107
I guess it's what she wanted.

785
01:35:48,295 --> 01:35:50,798
But I'll never know.

786
01:35:55,469 --> 01:35:57,554
I must live with that.

787
01:36:00,682 --> 01:36:02,559
As must I.

788
01:36:03,977 --> 01:36:06,813
You? You've done nothing.
Nothing?

789
01:36:10,191 --> 01:36:12,558
I've wanted you and Louisa...

790
01:36:12,662 --> 01:36:16,656
with all my mind and heart and will for seven long years.

791
01:36:17,949 --> 01:36:19,690
It seems to me that my desire...

792
01:36:19,794 --> 01:36:22,537
has destroyed everything that stood in its way:

793
01:36:23,246 --> 01:36:26,895
your wife, your house, your world.

794
01:36:28,334 --> 01:36:31,337
I never knew there was so much power in desire.

795
01:36:33,088 --> 01:36:37,280
And if it was so...are you sorry?

796
01:36:37,468 --> 01:36:39,240
No.

797
01:36:48,812 --> 01:36:51,314
Then we deserve each other.

798
01:36:56,819 --> 01:36:59,676
May God have mercy on us.

799
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:10,911
Why did you give me away?

800
01:38:14,269 --> 01:38:18,398
I didn't. I sold you.

801
01:38:31,744 --> 01:38:33,725
How much for?

802
01:38:35,206 --> 01:38:37,583
£500.

803
01:38:38,876 --> 01:38:43,213
Is that a lot?
It's a fortune.

804
01:38:55,058 --> 01:38:57,873
I'm glad it was a lot.

805
01:39:13,701 --> 01:39:15,786
Mama.

806
01:39:18,831 --> 01:39:23,523
Mama.
Oh, my pretty. My pretty.

807
01:39:23,877 --> 01:39:25,754
Mama.

808
01:39:30,217 --> 01:39:32,094
Mama.

809
01:39:33,595 --> 01:39:35,472
Mama.
