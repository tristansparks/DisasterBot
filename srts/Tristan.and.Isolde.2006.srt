00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:55,029
[Wind Howling]

2
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:28,437
[Laughing]
A year younger than I was for my first.

3
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:32,191
- When can I have a stag?
- [Scoffs] A stag?

4
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:36,946
- Come on!
- Tell me again what you said last week.

5
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:39,699
[Wind Howling]

6
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:45,371
Let that be a reminder to you.
[Chuckles]

7
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,085
I got it. I got it.

8
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:54,297
[Laughing]

9
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:02,597
Why would they join
against the Irish?

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,308
- Because someone has to stand up to them.
- You?

11
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:09,145
Me, Marke, all the tribes.
We can't resist alone.

12
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,732
- I could.
- [Chuckles] My little warrior.

13
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,775
We have to be careful.

14
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:20,031
[Indistinct]

15
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:23,451
Come home without something
for your lady, you'll have hell to pay.

16
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:30,166
- Can I?
- [Man] Of course you can, boy.

17
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,710
- The Angles have arrived, my lord...
- [Duck Quacking]

18
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:36,422
As well as the Celts, my fellow Jutes
and the Saxons.

19
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,467
Good. With Marke...

20
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,137
- we'll all be here.
- Yeah. It's a great day.

21
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,181
- Let us hope so.
- Yeah.

22
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,183
Thanks.

23
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,146
[Goat Bleating]

24
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:57,193
We heard the news.
Pray for a son.

25
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,321
- Mother.
- [Father] Welcome to Tantallon.

26
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,406
I made this for you.

27
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:18,130
[Rapping]

28
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,216
Friends.

29
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:27,682
Look at us, the tribes of Britain.

30
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:30,852
Divided.

31
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:34,814
Weak. Just as the Irish like us.

32
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:36,858
[Murmuring]

33
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:42,029
But if we were one land... united...

34
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:44,657
we would outnumber them 2-to-1.

35
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,536
We could defeat them once and for all.
That's why we're here today.

36
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:54,083
- To sign this treaty of unification.
- Who would be king?

37
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,878
The strongest among us...

38
00:03:56,961 --> 00:04:00,006
- Lord Marke.
- [Murmuring]

39
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,895
Look, if you're happy sending
all your gold to Ireland...

40
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,063
living as slaves,
by all means, do nothing.

41
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:21,736
If we were happy doing that,
we would never have risked coming here.

42
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:25,072
[Chattering]

43
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:32,371
Friends, my wife is with child.
My heart tells me it's a boy.

44
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:37,251
I want him to grow old
in a land where all of us...

45
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,712
all the tribes... Pict...

46
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,925
Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon...
are at peace.

47
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,553
[Shouts]

48
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:51,724
This island has not known unity
since the Romans left.

49
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:54,310
That is why I sign this treaty.

50
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:57,605
- And why should we follow you?
- Perhaps, Wictred...

51
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,732
because your last attempt
to form an alliance...

52
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:03,236
without the knowledge of half
the barons in this room has failed.

53
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,321
- [Laughing]
- [Man] Alarm!

54
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,365
- [Man #2] What for?
- The Irish are here!

55
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,911
- [Screaming]
- [Shouting]

56
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,622
- Take all your men, guard the women.
- But you won't have enough...

57
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,958
Go!

58
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:24,298
[Clattering]

59
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:28,094

Back this way. Hurry!

- No!

66
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:08,342
Let me fight!

Please, don't hurt him!

70
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:45,880
Father.

71
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,619
[Thuds]

72
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,122

76
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:38,140
Tristan. Tristan.

77
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,315
[Woman]
No!

78

[Drumbeat]

80
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:41,329
She's with the gods now, Isolde.
You'll see her again someday.

81
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,372
Will I?

82
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,501
Morholt returns.

83
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,974
What news of the treaty?

84
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:08,731
Good, Morholt.

85
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,903
Good.

86
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:28,668
[Woman]
Your mother loved you so much, Isolde.

87
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,379
Why did she die, Bragnae? Why?

88
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:37,760
It was an ill vapor that took her...

89
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,846
a fever.

90
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,891
No. It was her heart.

91
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,950
[Horses Approaching]

92
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,009
[Man]
The Irish have been here.

93
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,807

[Sobbing]

96
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,653
Your husband?

97
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:41,115
Oh. Oh, Sister, I'm so sorry.

98
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,745
[Sister]
The executions lasted a day.

99
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,955
They made sport of us.

100
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,917
A whole generation of men.

101
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,002
Who's this?

102
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,839
[Marke]
Tristan, son of Aragon.

103
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:59,508
We're his family now.

104
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:13,022
I have a son about your age.

105
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:15,983
Melot. Melot?

106
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,447
Melot, this is Tristan.

107
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,619
What shall we do, my lord?

108
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,875
Rebuild.

109
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,347
[Man]
Three, four.

110
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,975
- One, two...
- Don't hold back.

111
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,894
Come on!

112
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:56,357
Three, four.

113
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,319
Tristan won't fight me.
Look, he's scared!

114
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,697
[Man]
Three, four.

115
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,825
One, two, three...

116
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:08,703
- Still won't fight?
- He's got the heart of a lion.

117
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:12,039
Just needs some time.

118
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:15,668
Why'd you take off your helmet?
You going to cry?

119
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,920
My father died too,
but you don't see me crying.

120
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:20,506
- Melot.
- That's right, run.

121
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:23,759
Find another trapdoor
to hide under, coward.

122
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:26,345
[Grunts]

123
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,564
Tristan!

124
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:04,050
Tristan! Tristan.
We found something.

125
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:08,763
Come on, this way.
Quick, come on.

126
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:10,765
- You are gonna love it.
- You'll love it.

127
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:13,059
Yeah, I... I found this trapdoor.

128
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:16,479
- Who found a trapdoor?
- [Laughs]

129
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,150
All right, Simon.
Well, you tell us how you found it.

130
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,282
Look at that.

131
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:35,748
Where does this lead?

132
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,833
You'll see.

133
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:42,838
Well, I like that vase.

134
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,840
Think I'll have that.

135
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:47,677
We always knew the castle
was built on Roman foundations...

136
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:50,763
but we didn't think
anything was left.

137
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,975
Must be a burial crypt
or something.

138
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:59,480
Here we are.
Bottom of the keep.

139
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,196
Who else knows about this?

140
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:10,199
- Nobody.
- Good.

141
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,335
[Man] These savages have rebuilt
the castle in Cornwall...

142
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:23,337
only now it's made of stone.

143
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:26,132
For Cornwall's next tribute,
I want slaves... young ones...

144
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:28,134
their future.

145
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:30,553
If Marke resists,
have Morholt crush him.

146
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:36,976
- My king.
- Morholt.

147
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:40,688
I have led your armies
to victories far and near.

148
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,690
I've made you rich and powerful.

149
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,943
Yes, you have.
You have been most loyal.

150
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,905
When I return from Cornwall,
I was hoping...

151
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,948
What would please you?

152
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,910
A wife.

153
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:12,094
It's dark in an hour.

154
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,306
What do you think
is really out there?

155
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,393
Britannia.

156
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,854
The old Roman lands.

157
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:24,524
A world full of evil and grief.

158
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,026
I want to see it.

159
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,365
Do you know what the future
looks like, Bragnae?

160
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:35,034
[Bragnae]
I see the life you were meant for.

161
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,287
Your father will speak with you.

162
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,044
Am I just a chattel
to be traded at your pleasure?

163
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:48,714
Do I have no say in my own life?

164
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,092
You have a duty to your king.

165
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:53,135
You are my father.

166
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,930
Then obey me, Daughter.

167
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:05,815
[Sighs]

168
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:15,783
Your father has given you the news?

169
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:20,663
- And do you welcome it?
- I accept it.

170
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,003
You know, we're more alike
than you might guess.

171
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,256
How so?

172
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,801
I, too, dabble in elixirs.

173
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,512
[Sword Unsheathes]

174
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,351
Poison. It's from
the livers of puffer fish.

175
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,564
Just a taste...
paralyzes all the senses.

176
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:51,235
So if the blade doesn't kill...

177
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,280
Rendered safe by thistle and bark.

178
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,582
And do you know
the antidote for this?

179
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,711
Yohimbine.

180
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:14,133
Makes a hard man even harder.

181
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:20,181
The only cure: Wild abandon.

182
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,187
Till our wedding day.

183
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:30,274
I'm to Cornwall to deal with rebels.

184
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:58,719
Release them.

185
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:01,055
Hey. Around. Around.

186
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,398
[Shouts]

187
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,569
Off me!

188
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:16,779
- Go find Tristan.
- Leave her!

189
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,454
Take him there. Get a rope.

190
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,046
Anyone foolish enough
to interfere in any way...

191
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,924
- shall suffer the same fate.
- No.

192
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:41,721
Please don't. Don't.
Take me. No! No!

193
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:44,265
- [Gags]
- [Screaming] Widseth!

194
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:49,395
Widseth!

195
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:53,274
If there are any more attacks,
we shall put our guests...

196
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,443
- to death and raze this entire land.
- [Sobbing]

197
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,820
Take the horses.

198
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,291
- [Marke] When would you strike?
- At once.

199
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:13,461
- Throw everything we have at them.
- They're hoping you'll do that.

200
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:17,507
On horse they outnumber us 2-to-1.
You'll lead the men straight to their deaths.

201
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:20,510
- So we do nothing?
- Donnchadh would like that even more...

202
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:22,845
me to lose face in front
of the other tribes.

203
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,348
No. We must act.

204
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,476
It must be decisive.

205
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,978
But we cannot act alone.

206
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:41,822
So have the good men of York
come to fight with us?

207
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:45,451
Hmm? Or the Saxons of Wessex?

208
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,162
My men don't want
to follow a Pict into battle...

209
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:51,541
let alone one leading
a pack of Angles and Celts.

210
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,043
Then why are you here?

211
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:57,213
I thought Tristan
should let me command his men.

212
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,717
- I make it my habit to follow no one.
- Except Marke?

213
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:05,805
Marke delivered me from that palace
when I was a boy. You ran.

214
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,725
So you can understand
when I think of kings, I think of him.

215
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:14,856
- And when I think of cowards...
- [Marke] They're one day from

216
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,900
Now, who will ride out
with Tristan to fight them?

217
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,038
What is your plan, Tristan?

218
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,501
I need our two fastest runners.

219
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,958
- [Man] There they go! After them!
- [Whinnies]

220
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,628
Hold off.

221
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,608
Halt!

222
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:42,902
Go around!

223
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:56,457
[Whinnies]

224
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,775
Morholt! They're back.

225
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,869
- [Laughing]
- They've got a head.

226
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:42,503
- [Shouting]
- It's a trap!

227
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,215
Kill the slaves!

228
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,801
[Screaming]

229
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,394
[Cracks]

230
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,938
[Horse Shrieks]

231
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,302
- Simon.
- [Grunts]

232
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,177
We're gonna get you home.

233
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:56,762
Simon.

234
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:59,557
I don't want to die.

235
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,312
[Exhales]

236
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:12,653
Tristan.

237
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:18,618
I can't feel my legs or my hands.

238
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,214
Poison.

239
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,219
A second boat.

240
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,851
Tristan.

241
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,695
[Melot]
He shall have a king's service.

242
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:12,880
Farewell, Tristan of Aragon.

243
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,966
Death to the Irish.

244
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:35,361
[Wind Howling]

245
00:27:10,188 --> 00:27:12,648
When the Irish came to Cornwall...

246
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:16,402
and my father surrendered...

247
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:20,615
you spared a dozen out of a hundred.

248
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:24,577
I am even less kind.

249
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,457
The leader and three
will take this message home.

250
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,542
As for the rest...

251
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:38,132
- [Thunderclap]
- [Chattering]

252
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,314
Victory.

253
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,777
And Tristan?

254
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:05,284
Simon too.

255
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,300
Did I love him like a son...

256
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:25,179
- or did I misuse him for my own purposes?
- He knew.

257
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:27,849
[Sniffles]
He knew.

258
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:39,110
[Wind Howling]

259
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:48,035
- [Flapping]
- [Gasps]

260
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,080
- Where are we going?
- Away.

261
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,249
Are you afflicted, child?
Speak to me.

262
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:58,504
Your father will find us
and have my head.

263
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:00,548
You are my charge. Please.

264
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:03,384
I am no one's charge.

265
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:05,553
You are.

266
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:07,930
And you will be Morholt's lady.

267
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:12,727
And live a loveless life like my mom?

268
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:19,192
What's that?

269
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:21,194
Where?

270
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:30,328
Isolde, wait. Don't.

271
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,916
[Speaking Foreign Language]

272
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,669
Isolde, don't.

273
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,425
- Isolde!
- It's a man.

274
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:47,303
Dead?

275
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:57,605
Alive! Bragnae, help me!

276
00:29:57,688 --> 00:29:59,899
- [Foreign Language]
- Help me!

277
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:01,651
- Isolde.
- Quickly!

278
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:04,987
[Grunting]

279
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,169
Start a fire.

280
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:25,258
- Oh.
- Quickly.

281
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:31,138
His heart falters.

282
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:40,314
- What are you doing?
- He needs heat. Now.

283
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:45,987
Get your clothes off, quickly.

284
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,826
Hurry.

285
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:55,496
Quickly! Smell that?
Smell the poison?

286
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:58,624
When he warms,
we'll need thistle and bark.

287
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:09,051
I've not been naked
with a man for 15 years.

288
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,938
[Isolde]
Hello.

289
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:25,860
You've been sleeping a long time.

290
00:31:28,446 --> 00:31:32,700
You're in Ireland.
Did you know that?

291
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,832
Shh.

292
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,918
It's all right.

293
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:45,171
You're safe here. No one knows.

294
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,591
Don't be scared. Just sleep.

295
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:52,595
Sleep.

296
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:08,444
[Hoof beats Approaching]

297
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:10,530
Oh.

00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,083
[Screams]

299
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,753
- No!
- It's all right. You don't need that.

300
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:28,047
I forgot to tell him about you.

301
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:32,927
I'll wait outside
with the other beasts.

302
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,641
- You said no one else knew.
- Sorry.

303
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:42,103
She's my maid, sworn to silence.

304
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,898
Um, lie down, please.

305
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:49,819
Please?

306
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:02,123
It's good you're remembering things.
This might sting.

307
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,960
Do you remember anything else?

308
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,589
The boat I found you in?

309
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:11,632
How you got this?

310
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:18,014
Too many questions.
There. Keep that dry.

311
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:21,309
Here are clothes, bread.

312
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,603
You have water and fire.

313
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:27,315
The ocean's outside
if you wish a bath.

314
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:30,443
You won't know where you're going,
so please don't try to leave.

315
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:32,445
Just trust me.

316
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:34,530
Why are you doing this?

317
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:40,328
I'll be back.

318
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:53,216
This is a dangerous game
you're playing.

319
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:59,472
- He's English, Isolde.
- And we've got him prisoner.

320
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,644
Under no circumstances
tell him your name, you hear me?

321
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:07,021
I thought you wished
to escape this place.

322
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,192
Did you hear me?

323
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:17,698
- [Whispering] You'll do no such thing.
- He'll need more food tomorrow.

324
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,825
He's not of your concern.

325
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:26,874
- You've been away.
- Oh, you noticed.

326
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:29,043
- Yes, I have a bit.
- Where?

327
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,380
Bragnae and I were spying
the convent at Brittas.

328
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:35,383
- Seeking sanctuary?
- Some women need it.

329
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:39,178
You'll find no refuge
in the new religion.

330
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:43,766
Your place is here, with Morholt.

331
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:45,768
Any word of my betrothed?

332
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:52,066
Overdue.

333
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:57,280
But comforted, no doubt,
that you yearn for him.

334
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,164
[Wind Howling]

335
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:43,618
What's your name?

336
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,457
Oh, I think it's better
we don't bother with names.

337
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,126
How can I thank you
if I don't have your name?

338
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:55,004
You just did.

339
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:03,262
If you insist, my name is Bragnae.

340
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:08,142
I'm a lady-in-waiting at the court.
My parents are dead.

341
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,646
My mother, she's the source
of the kindness you find so puzzling.

342
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:16,150
My father would have
left you where you fell.

343
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:18,152
I'm Tristan of Aragon.

344
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,322
Well, Tristan of Aragon...

345
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,951
I'd guess about you too,
but I think I've already seen everything.

346
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:28,037
Sir, I hope you appreciate the risks...

347
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:32,083
we are taking and will honor us
by leaving as soon as you are able.

348
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:39,507
She likes me.

349
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,843
She's right though. You do risk.

350
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,599
Here. And what of your parents?

351
00:36:48,724 --> 00:36:51,060
[Clears Throat]

352
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:53,354
They also died when I was a child.

353
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:56,357
Of what?

354
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:59,944
A different type of Irish kindness.

355
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:03,155
I'm sorry.

356
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:40,109
Tomorrow then?

357
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:43,070
Tomorrow.

brought you forth.

362
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,830
Ridiculous.

363

I happen to believe what that says.

364

Don't you think there's more to life?

365
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:44,006
- [Tristan] Than what?
- Something more than duty and death.

366
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,552
Why be capable of feelings
if we're not to have them?

367
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:50,471
Why long for things
if they're not meant to be ours?

368
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:53,808
Oh, don't listen to me.

369
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:56,769
You're so sure of things.

370
00:38:56,853 --> 00:39:00,982
Your certainty, it's-it's like armor.
I wish I had that.

371
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:06,195
- Why would you need it?
- The joy of being a lady.

Wanting something I can't have...

373
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:15,204

You need a rest...

377

would want to see you.

382
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:10,551
Dark, tall, nearly twice your size.

383
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:12,762
An absolute gentleman.

384
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:18,392
I thought...

385
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:21,229
earlier when you spoke
of wanting something you can't have...

386
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,439
I didn't know what
I was talking about.

387
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:53,970
Outside, just past that bluff,
there is a boat.

388
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:58,182
That's how you should go
when you leave.

389

Tristan! They found your boat.

At this very moment,
the king himself is scouring the coasts.

He'll find you. He finds everyone.
The tide is coming. You must go.

Why not? Please.

Tristan, we both know this can't be.
We've known it from the start.

That doesn't mean
it isn't true. It is.

It just cannot be.

Beware. We seek him as I speak.

Hopefully, it's just
his rotted corpse we'll find...

- She is stunned.
- As am I by her grief.

We should, uh... We should assault
the British straightaway.

Crush them with maximum force.

Maximum force?

00:46:29,764 --> 00:46:33,935
The one butchered by Marke's tribes?
Would that be the force you speak of?

422

We'll not confront them again
until our numbers are refreshed.

423

And until then...

424

Of what nature?

426
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:52,495
A prize, perhaps.

What's this about a tournament?

Donnchadh.

429
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,914
He's offered his daughter
and the lands of Lionath...

430
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:39,500
as dowry to whichever
English tribe wins.

431
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:42,378
It's a clever way of setting us
against each other.

432
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:44,964
Well, the other barons
will see through that.

As baron of Wessex...

00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:50,469
it's my duty to fight in this tournament
for my people.

- And what of the support you promised Tristan?

That seems more real than any alliance.

- And ours as well.

- [Man] Yeah, back from the dead.

in tournament and divides all our tribes.

or the wealth, half the barons...

- Why?

There are other things
to live for... duty, honor.

711
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:21,973
They are not life, Tristan.
They are the shells of life.

And empty ones if in the end...

713

days and days without love.

Now, he breaks tradition and scares
all the barons by naming you his second.

you'd be better.

01:34:26,641 --> 01:34:28,684
Isolde, this must end.

Isolde. Tristan, what are you...

888
01:35:23,865 --> 01:35:25,825
No.

889
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:31,289
I see how it is in Cornwall.

890
01:35:31,372 --> 01:35:35,126
My money is good enough.
My alliance is good enough!

891
01:35:35,209 --> 01:35:39,964
But my daughter you pass among
your lieutenants like a whore!

- I see no relation to me here.

- [Man #2] He can't.

905

[Man #3]
Yeah. We should sue for peace.

You can feel it.

[Wictred]
You're right. There's very little time.

908
01:37:19,188 --> 01:37:22,692
Fortunately, Donnchadh
has no quarrel with anyone here.

909

Our people need a stronger chief.

- Who might that be, Wictred?
- Melot.

916
01:37:45,006 --> 01:37:50,636
For too long, the ablest among us
has been denied his rightful place.

917
01:37:50,761 --> 01:37:55,433
I pledge him my allegiance
and offer my services as his second.

I've been... selfish.

perhaps I'd given enough...

I am sure of it."

had I not stretched out this hand
to save your wretched life.

Well, insult me with your defense.

Since you thought he was dead.

945
01:40:23,539 --> 01:40:26,959
I found him, wounded,
on a beach in Ireland.

946
01:40:28,127 --> 01:40:30,171
I hid him from my father...

947
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:34,675
and I told him my name was Bragnae.

948
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,890
So when he came to the tournament
at Dunluce to win Donnchadh's daughter...

949
01:40:40,973 --> 01:40:42,892
he didn't realize it was me.

- Tristan and Isolde?
- You know what I could never work out?

How it was conducted.
How she got in and out of D'Or unseen.

- The tunnel.
- What?

- An old secret.
- Secrets.

[Sighs]
It's in the past now.

1071
01:51:10,895 --> 01:51:13,523
In the past.

1072
01:51:13,648 --> 01:51:16,567
They've breached the palisades.

1073
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:20,363

[Splashing]

1082
01:52:45,948 --> 01:52:49,827
Will you always be little men
that cannot see what was...

1083
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:51,871
and could be again?

1084
01:52:56,209 --> 01:52:59,962
There is no middle ground!

1085
01:53:00,046 --> 01:53:02,507
So slay us!

01:53:05,468 --> 01:53:07,470
Or slay him!

01:55:07,381 --> 01:55:09,342
We'll lose everything.

1101
01:55:12,637 --> 01:55:14,514
I must heed their call.

1102
01:55:19,268 --> 01:55:21,145
I am the king.

1103
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:25,274
We've driven them back as far as we can,
but they held on the south road.

1104
01:55:25,358 --> 01:55:27,443
Good-bye, my friend.

I will always be with you.

You were right.

1110
01:56:00,643 --> 01:56:04,021
I don't know
if life is greater than death...

1111
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:11,112
but love was more than either.

1112

"Where can we find
two better hemispheres...

"without sharp North,
without declining West?

that none can slacken...

01:57:02,747 --> 01:57:04,665
none can die."
