1
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,350
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

2
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,567
You feeling any better?

3
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,565
A little bit.

4
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,238
- Guess what.
- What?

5
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,566
Your grandfather's here.

6
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,198
Mom, can't you tell him I'm sick?

7
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,035
You're sick. That's why he's here.

8
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,707
He'll pinch my cheek.

9
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,329
I hate that.

10
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,127
Maybe he won't.

11
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,623
Hey! How is the sickie?

12
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,083
Huh?

13
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,589
I think I'll leave you two pals alone.

14
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,015
I brought ya a special present.

15
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,808
- What is it?
- Open it up.

16
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,354
- A book?
- That's right.

17
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,653
When I was your age,
television was called books.

18
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,947
And this is a special book.

19
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,322
It was the book my father
used to read to me when I was sick,

20
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,994
and I used to read it to your father.

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,197
And today, I'm gonna read it to you.

22
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,791
- Does it got any sports in it?
- Are you kidding?

23
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,746
Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge,

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,675
giants, monsters, chases, escapes,

25
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,299
true love, miracles.

26
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,220
Doesn't sound too bad.

27
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,720
- I'll try and stay awake.
- Oh.

28
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,177
Well, thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

29
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,684
Your vote of confidence is overwhelming.

30
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,849
All right.

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,692
<i>The Princess Bride...</i>

32
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,484
by S. Morgenstern.

33
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,781
Chapter one.

34
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,533
"Buttercup was raised on a small farm
in the country of Florin.

35
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,331
Her favorite pastimes
were riding her horse

36
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,160
<i>and tormenting the farm boy
that worked there.</i>

37
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,497
<i>His name was Westley,
but she never called him that."</i>

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,628
<i>Isn't that a wonderful beginning?</i>

39
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,170
<i>Yeah, it's reallygood.</i>

40
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,177
<i>"Nothing gave Buttercup
as much pleasure as ordering Westley around."</i>

41
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,886
Farm boy, polish my horse's saddle.

42
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,851
I want to see my face
shining in it by morning.

43
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,682
As you wish.

44
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,151
<i>"'As you wish' was all he ever said to her."</i>

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,406
Farm boy, fill these with water.

46
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,954
Please?

47
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,374
As you wish.

48
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,756
<i>"That day, she was amazed to discover</i>

49
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,754
<i>that when he was saying 'as you wish, '</i>

50
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,927
<i>what he meant was 'I love you. '</i>

51
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:48,559
<i>And even more amazing was the day
she realized she truly loved him back."</i>

52
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,221
Farm boy.

53
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,524
Fetch me that pitcher?

54
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,082
As you wish.

55
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,969
<i>Hold it. Hold it.</i>

56
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,893
What is this?
Are you tryin' to trick me?

57
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,891
Wh-Where's the sports?

58
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,772
Is this a kissing book?

59
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,566
Wait. Just wait.

60
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,393
Well, when does it get good?

61
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,026
All right, keep your shirt on. Let me read.

62
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,199
"Westley had no money for marriage,

63
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,743
so he packed his few belongings
and left the farm

64
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,661
to seek his fortune across the sea.

65
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,036
<i>It was a very emotional time
for Buttercup."</i>

66
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,789
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

67
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,879
I fear I'll never see you again.

68
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,002
Of course you will.

69
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,252
But what if something happens to you?

70
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,223
Hear this now.

71
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,810
I will always come for you.

72
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,306
But how can you be sure?

73
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,516
This is true love.

74
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,816
Think this happens every day?

75
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,913
<i>"Westley didn't reach his destination.</i>

76
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,246
<i>His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts,</i>

77
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,753
<i>who never left captives alive.</i>

78
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,631
<i>When Buttercup got the news
that Westley was murdered..."</i>

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,507
<i>Murdered bypirates is good.</i>

80
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,964
<i>"she went into her room
and shut the door.</i>

81
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,801
<i>And for days, she neither slept nor ate."</i>

82
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,804
I will never love again.

83
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,444
<i>"Five years later,
the main square ofFlorin City</i>

84
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,272
<i>was filled as never before</i>

85
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,360
<i>to hear the announcement of
the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to-be."</i>

86
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,746
My people,

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,957
a month from now,

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,964
our country will have
its 500th anniversary.

89
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,139
On that sundown,
I shall marry a lady

90
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,764
who was once
a commoner like yourselves.

91
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,390
But perhaps

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,565
you will not find her common now.

93
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,315
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes!

94
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,021
My people,

95
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,617
the princess Buttercup!

96
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,009
<i>"Buttercup's emptiness consumed her.</i>

97
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,686
<i>Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck
the right to choose his bride,</i>

98
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,515
<i>she did not love him.</i>

99
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,282
<i>Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
that she would grow to love him,</i>

100
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,987
<i>the onlyjoy she found
was in her daily ride."</i>

101
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,754
A word, my lady?

102
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,713
We are but poor, lost circus performers.

103
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,299
Is there a village nearby?

104
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,602
There is nothing nearby, not for miles.

105
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,184
Then there will be
no one to hear you scream.

106
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,151
What is that you're ripping?

107
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,985
It's fabric from the uniform
of an army officer of Guilder.

108
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,740
Who is Guilder?

109
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,414
The country across the sea.
The sworn enemy of Florin.

110
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,207
Go!

111
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,205
Once the horse reaches the castle,

112
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,539
the fabric will make the prince suspect
that the Guilderians have abducted his love.

113
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,171
When he finds her body dead
on the Guilder frontier,

114
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,753
his suspicions will be totally confirmed.

115
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,339
You never said anything
about killing anyone.

116
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,267
I've hired you to help me start a war.

117
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,938
It's a prestigious line of work
with a long and glorious tradition.

118
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,108
I just don't think it's right,
killing an innocent girl.

119
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,359
Am I going mad,
or did the word "think" escape your lips?

120
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,193
You were not hired for your brains,
you hippopotamic landmass!

121
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,652
I agree with Fezzik.

122
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,742
Oh, the sot has spoken.

123
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,119
What happens to her
is not truly your concern.

124
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,620
<i>I</i> will kill her.

125
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,668
And remember this. Never forget this!

126
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:11,796
When I found you, you were so slobbering drunk
you couldn't buy brandy!

127
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,592
And you!

128
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,761
Friendless. Brainless.

129
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,884
Helpless! Hopeless!

130
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,433
Do you want me to send you back
to where you were?

131
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,432
Unemployed in Greenland?

132
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,988
That Vizzini, he can fuss.

133
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,324
"Fuss." "Fuss."

134
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,205
I think he like to scream at us.

135
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,504
Probably he means no <i>harm.</i>

136
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,585
He's very, very short on charm.

137
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,716
You have a great gift for rhyme.

138
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,721
- Yes. Yes. Some of the time.
- Enough of that!

139
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,474
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?

140
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,101
If there are, we all be dead.

141
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,478
No more rhymes! Now, I mean it!

142
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,356
Anybody want a peanut?

143
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,787
We'll reach the cliffs by dawn.

144
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,794
- Why are you doing that?
- Making sure nobody's follow us.

145
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,246
That would be inconceivable.

146
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,583
Despite what you think,
you will be caught.

147
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,886
And when you are,
the prince will see you all hanged.

148
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,760
Of all the necks on this boat, Highness,

149
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,388
the one you should be
worrying about is your own.

150
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,025
Stop doing that!
We can all relax. It's almost over.

151
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,694
- You are sure nobody's follow us?
- As I told you,

152
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,195
it would be absolutely, totally
and in all other ways inconceivable.

153
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,197
No one in Guilder knows what we've done.

154
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,280
And no one in Florin
could've gotten here so fast.

155
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,246
Out of curiosity, why do you ask?

156
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,546
No reason. Suddenly, I just happened
to look behind us and something is there.

157
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,089
What?

158
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,051
Probably some local fisherman
out for a pleasure cruise at night

159
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,979
through eel-infested waters.

160
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,475
What? Go in! Get after her!

161
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,231
I don't swim.

162
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,062
I only dog paddle.

163
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,782
Veer left!

164
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,912
Left! Left!

165
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,464
Do you know
what that sound is, Highness?

166
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,133
Those are the shrieking eels!

167
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,678
If you don't believe me, just wait.

168
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:07,930
They always grow louder
when they're about to feed on human flesh!

169
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:16,147
If you swim back now, I promise,
no harm will come to you.

170
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,525
I doubt you'll get such an offer
from the eels.

171
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,662
She doesn't get eaten
by the eels at this time.

172
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,085
- What?
- The eel doesn't get her.

173
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,959
I'm explaining to you
because you look nervous.

174
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,837
Uh... I wasn't nervous.

175
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,715
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned,
but that's not the same thing.

176
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,175
Because we can stop now if you want.

177
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,979
No, you could read a little bit more,
if you want.

178
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,271
Mmm.

179
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,399
"Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

180
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,772
<i>Those are the shrieking eels."</i>

181
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,275
We're past that, Grandpa.
You read it already.

182
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:07,781
Oh... Oh, my goodness. I did.
I'm sorry. Beg your pardon.

183
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,862
<i>All right, all right. Let's see.</i>

184
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,369
<i>She was in the water.
The eel was comin' after her.</i>

185
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,826
<i>She was frightened.
The eel started to charge her, and then...</i>

186
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,044
Put her down. Just put her down.

187
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,258
I think he's getting closer.

188
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,307
He's no concern of ours! Sail on!

189
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,347
I suppose you think you're brave, don't you?

190
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,975
Only compared to some.

191
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,522
Look! He's right on top of us!

192
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,358
I wonder if he is using
the same wind we are using.

193
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,945
Whoever he is, he's too late. See?

194
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,450
The Cliffs of Insanity!

195
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,660
Hurry up!

196
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,416
Move the thing!

197
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,248
And that other thing!

198
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,667
Move it!

199
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,925
We're safe. Only Fezzik
is strong enough to go up our way.

200
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,887
<i>He'll</i> have to sail around for hours
till he finds a harbor.

201
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:05,649
He's climbing the rope,
and he's gaining on us.

202
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,320
Inconceivable.

203
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,951
- Faster!
- I thought I <i>was</i> going faster.

204
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,199
You were supposed to be
this colossus.

205
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,703
You were this great, legendary thing!
And yet he gains!

206
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,628
Well, I'm carrying three people,
and he got only himself.

207
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,332
I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to
have to find myself a new giant, that's all.

208
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,089
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please?

209
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:38,310
Did I make it clear
that your job is at stake?

210
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,073
He's got very good arms.

211
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,170
He didn't fall? Inconceivable.

212
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,795
You keep using that word. I do not think
it means what you think it means.

213
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,880
My God. He's climbing.

214
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,933
Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us
with the princess and must therefore die.

215
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,103
You, carry her.
We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier.

216
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,058
Catch up when he's dead.
If he falls, fine. If not, the sword.

217
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,484
I'm going to duel him left-handed.

218
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,482
You know what a hurry we're in!

219
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,655
It's the only way I can be satisfied.

220
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:18,452
- If I use my right, over too quickly.
- Oh, have it your way.

221
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,996
You be careful.
People in masks cannot be trusted.

222
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,298
I'm waiting!

223
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,434
Hello there!

224
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,693
Slow going?

225
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,777
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is not as easy as it looks,

226
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,529
so I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't distract me.

227
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,030
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

228
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,373
I do not suppose
you could speed things up?

229
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,380
If you're in such a hurry,
you could lower a rope or a tree branch

230
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,553
or find something useful to do.

231
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,054
I could do that.
I think I've got some rope up here.

232
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,056
But I do not think
you would accept my help

233
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,308
since I am only
waiting around to kill you.

234
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,565
That does put a damper
on our relationship.

235
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:35,112
But I promise I will not kill you
until you reach the top.

236
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,237
That's very comforting,
but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.

237
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,784
I hate waiting.

238
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,155
I could give you my word as a Spaniard.

239
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,741
No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.

240
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,918
Is there any way you'll trust me?

241
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,041
Nothing comes to mind.

242
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,750
I swear on the soul of my father,
Domingo Montoya.

243
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,756
You will reach the top alive.

244
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,921
Throw me the rope.

245
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,456
Thank you.

246
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,959
W-W-We'll wait until you're ready.

247
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,882
Again, thank you.

248
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,599
I do not mean to pry,

249
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,403
but you don't, by any chance, happen
to have six fingers on your right hand?

250
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,235
Do you always
begin conversations this way?

251
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,902
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

252
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,828
He was a great sword maker, my father.

253
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,459
When the six-fingered man appear
and request a special sword,

254
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,290
my father took the job.

255
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,294
He slave a year before he was done.

256
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,185
I've never seen its equal.

257
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,065
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it,

258
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,398
but at one-tenth his promised price.

259
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,699
My father refuse.

260
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,699
Without a word, the six-fingered man
slash him through the heart.

261
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,706
I love my father.

262
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,411
So naturally,
I challenge his murderer to a duel.

263
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,250
I fail.

264
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,341
Six-fingered man leave me alive.

265
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,504
But he gave me this.

266
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,226
- How old were you?
- I was 11 years old.

267
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,516
When I was strong enough,

268
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,647
I dedicate my life to the study of fencing.

269
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:23,026
So the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

270
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,943
I will go up to
the six-fingered man and say,

271
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,994
"Hello.

272
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,163
My name is Inigo Montoya.

273
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,538
You killed my father.

274
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,870
Prepare to die."

275
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,335
You've done nothing but study swordplay?

276
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,546
More pursue it than study lately.

277
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,219
You see, I cannot find him.

278
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,424
It's been 20 years now.
I am starting to lose confidence.

279
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,808
I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills.
Not a lot of money in revenge.

280
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,937
Well, I... I certainly hope
you find him someday.

281
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,982
- You are ready then?
- Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.

282
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,440
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

283
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,368
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

284
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,120
Begin.

285
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,772
You are using Bonetti's defense
against me, huh?

286
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,780
- I thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain.
- Naturally.

287
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,578
- You must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
- Naturally.

288
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,702
But I find Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro.
Don't you?

289
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,368
Unless the enemy has study his Agrippa.

290
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,546
Which I have.

291
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,716
- You are wonderful.
- Thank you.

292
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,345
- I've worked hard to become so.
- I admit that you are better than I am.

293
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,803
- Then why are you smiling?
- Because I know something you don't know.

294
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,732
- And what is that?
- I am not left-handed.

295
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,779
- You are amazing.
- I ought to be after 20 years.

296
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,287
- There's something I ought to tell you.
- Tell me.

297
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,868
I'm not left-handed either.

298
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,654
Who are you?

299
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,276
No one of consequence.

300
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,858
I must know.

301
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,614
Get used to disappointment.

302
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,285
Okay.

303
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,038
Kill me quickly.

304
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,539
I would as soon destroy a stained-glass window
as an artist like yourself.

305
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,712
However, since I can't have you
following me either...

306
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,635
Please understand
I hold you in the highest respect.

307
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,474
Inconceivable!

308
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,276
Give her to me.
Catch up with us quickly.

309
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,024
- What do I do?
- Finish him.

310
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,730
Finish him your way!

311
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,362
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

312
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,985
Which way is my way?

313
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,576
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.

314
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,704
In a few minutes, the man in black
will come running around the bend.

315
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,458
The minute his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

316
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,046
My way is not very sportsmanlike.

317
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,700
I did that on purpose.
I didn't have to miss.

318
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,330
I believe you.

319
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,371
So what happens now?

320
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,003
We face each other as God intended.

321
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,928
Sportsmanlike.
No tricks. No weapons.

322
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,504
Skill against skill alone.

323
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,057
You mean, you'll put down your rock
and I'll put down my sword

324
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,635
and we'll try and kill each other
like civilized people?

325
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,103
I could kill you now.

326
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,476
Frankly...

327
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,568
I think the odds are slightly in your favor
at hand fighting.

328
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:57,022
It's not my fault
being the biggest and the strongest.

329
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,948
I don't even exercise.

330
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,379
Look, are you just fiddling around
with me or what?

331
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,965
I just want you to feel you are doing well.

332
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,925
I hate for people to die embarrassed.

333
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,561
You're quick.

334
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,231
- And a good thing too.
- Why do you wear a mask?

335
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,684
Were you burned by acid or something like that?

336
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,589
Oh, no, it's just they're
terribly comfortable.

337
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,730
I think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

338
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,787
I just figured why
you give me so much trouble.

339
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,621
Why is that, do you think?

340
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:54,079
Well, I haven't fought just one person...

341
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,505
for so long.

342
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,751
Been specializing in groups,

343
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,679
battling gangs for local charities.

344
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,175
That kind of thing.

345
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,227
Why should that make
such a... difference?

346
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,429
Well, you see,

347
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,514
you use different moves

348
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,270
when you're fighting...

349
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,817
half a dozen... people...

350
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,445
than when you only...

351
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,524
have to be worried... about one.

352
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,920
I do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

353
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:43,003
But in the meantime,
rest well and dream of large women.

354
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,908
There was a mighty duel.

355
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,616
It ranged all over.

356
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,698
They were both masters.

357
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,125
Who won? How did it end?

358
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,666
The loser ran off alone,

359
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,460
but the winner...

360
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:25,178
followed those footprints toward Guilder.

361
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,721
Shall we track them both?

362
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,842
The loser is nothing.
Only the princess matters.

363
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,604
Clearly this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

364
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,558
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

365
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,392
Could this be a trap?

366
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:44,026
I always think everything could be a trap,
which is why I'm still alive.

367
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,958
So, it is down to you,
and it is down to me.

368
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,218
If you wish her dead,
by all means keep moving forward.

369
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,631
- Let me explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

370
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,468
You're trying to kidnap
what I've rightfully stolen.

371
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,395
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached?

372
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,472
There will be no arrangement.

373
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,182
And you're killing her.

374
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,446
Well, if there can be no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

375
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,273
I'm afraid so.

376
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,700
I can't compete with you physically,

377
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,948
and you're no match for my brains.

378
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,156
- You're that smart?
- Let me put it this way.

379
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:38,038
Have you ever heard of Plato?
Aristotle? Socrates?

380
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,619
- Yes.
- Morons.

381
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:40,999
Really?

382
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,548
In that case,
I challenge you to a battle of wits.

383
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,920
For the princess?

384
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,344
To the death?

385
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,047
I accept.

386
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,973
Good. Then pour the wine.

387
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,901
Inhale this, but do not touch.

388
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,532
I smell nothing.

389
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,036
What you do not smell
is called iocane powder.

390
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,538
It is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid,

391
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,995
and is among the more deadly poisons
known to man.

392
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,089
Hmm.

393
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,191
All right. Where is the poison?

394
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,863
The battle of wits has begun.

395
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,907
It ends when you decide
and we both drink

396
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,862
and find out who is right
and who is dead.

397
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,198
But it's so simple.

398
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,534
All I have to do is
divine from what I know of you.

399
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:06,214
Are you the sort of man who would put the poison
into his own goblet or his enemy's?

400
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,167
Now, a clever man would put the poison
into his own goblet

401
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,425
because he would know that only a great fool
would reach for what he was given.

402
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:16,804
I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not
choose the wine in front of you.

403
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,351
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

404
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:23,682
You would've counted on it. So I can clearly
not choose the wine in front of me.

405
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,483
- You've made your decision then?
- Not remotely.

406
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,938
Because iocane comes from Australia,
as everyone knows.

407
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,398
And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals.

408
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,532
And criminals are used to having people
not trust them, as you are not trusted by me.

409
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,079
So I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

410
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,249
Truly you have a dizzying intellect.

411
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,417
Wait till I get going!

412
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,244
- Where was I?
- Australia.

413
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,173
Yes. Australia. And you must have suspected
I would've known the powder's origin.

414
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,546
So I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

415
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,425
- You're just stalling now.
- You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

416
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,428
You've beaten my giant,
which means you're exceptionally strong.

417
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,179
So you could've put the poison in your own goblet,
trusting on your strength to save you,

418
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,980
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

419
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,730
But you've also bested my Spaniard,
which means you must've studied.

420
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,813
And in studying, you must've
learned that man is mortal.

421
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,196
So you would've put the poison
as far from yourself as possible,

422
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,028
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

423
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,159
You're trying to trick me into
giving away something. It won't work.

424
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,084
It <i>has</i> worked! You've given everything away!
I know where the poison is!

425
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,583
- Then make your choice.
- I will, and I choose...

426
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,629
What in the world can that be?

427
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,002
What? Where?

428
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,218
I don't see anything.

429
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:38,093
Well, I-I could've sworn I saw something.
No matter. Hmm.

430
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,807
- What's so funny?
- I-I'll tell you in a minute.

431
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,638
First, let's drink.

432
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,475
Me from my glass,
and you from yours.

433
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,826
- You guessed wrong.
- You only think I guessed wrong.

434
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,083
That's what's so funny!
I switched glasses when your back was turned!

435
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,583
You fool!

436
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,166
You fell victim
to one of the classic blunders.

437
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,298
The most famous is
never get involved in a land war in Asia.

438
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,347
But only slightly less well known is this:

439
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:23,517
never go in against a Sicilian
when death is on the line!

440
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,615
- Who are you?
- I am no one to be trifled with.

441
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,163
That is all you ever need know.

442
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,742
To think, all that time
it was your cup that was poisoned.

443
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,247
They were both poisoned.

444
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,961
I spent the last few years building up
an immunity to iocane powder.

445
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,678
Someone has beaten the giant.

446
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,476
There will be great suffering in Guilder
if she dies.

447
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,742
Catch your breath.

448
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:26,289
If you'll release me, whatever you ask
for ransom you'll get it. I promise you.

449
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,335
And what is that worth,
the promise of a woman?

450
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,832
You're very funny, Highness.

451
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,129
I was giving you a chance.
It does not matter where you take me.

452
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,551
There's no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

453
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,881
He can track a falcon on a cloudy day.
He can find you.

454
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,593
- You think your dearest love will save you?
- I never said he was my dearest love.

455
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,928
And yes, he will save me.
That I know.

456
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,565
You admit to me you do not love your fiancé.

457
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,267
He knows I do not love him.

458
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,478
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.

459
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,734
I have loved more deeply
than a killer like yourself could ever dream...

460
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,373
That was a warning, Highness.
The next time, my hand flies on its own.

461
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,293
For where I come from,
there are penalties when a woman lies.

462
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,793
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.

463
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,258
And there are the princess's footprints.

464
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,057
She is alive, or was an hour ago.

465
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,227
If she is otherwise when I find her,

466
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,600
I shall be very put out.

467
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,188
- Rest, Highness.
- I know who you are.

468
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,444
Your cruelty reveals everything.

469
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,652
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.

470
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,159
With pride. What can I do for you?

471
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,162
You can die slowly,
cut into a thousand pieces.

472
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:56,121
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness.

473
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,796
Why loose your venom on me?

474
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,834
You killed my love.

475
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,384
It's possible.

476
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,545
I kill a lot of people.

477
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,425
Who was this love of yours?
Another prince like this one?

478
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,557
Ugly and rich and scabby?

479
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,936
No. A farm boy. Poor.

480
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,857
Poor and perfect,

481
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,691
with eyes like the sea after a storm.

482
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:29,240
On the high seas your ship attacked.
The Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.

483
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,242
I can't afford to make exceptions.

484
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,291
Once word leaks out a pirate has gone soft,
people begin to disobey you,

485
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,710
and then it's nothing
but work, work, work all the time.

486
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,162
You mock my pain!

487
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,748
Life is pain, Highness.

488
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,050
Anyone who says differently
is selling something.

489
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,764
I remember this farm boy of yours, I think.

490
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,181
This would be what? Five years ago?

491
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,605
Does it bother you to hear?

492
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,399
Nothing you can say will upset me.

493
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,068
He died well.

494
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,191
That should please you.

495
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,398
No bribe attempts or blubbering.

496
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,738
He simply said, "Please.

497
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,200
Please, I need to live."

498
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,704
It was the "please"
that caught my memory.

499
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,831
I asked him what was
so important for him.

500
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,079
"True love," he replied.

501
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,965
And then he spoke of a girl
of surpassing beauty and faithfulness.

502
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,593
I can only assume he meant you.

503
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:34,097
You should bless me for destroying him
before he found out what you really are.

504
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,473
And what am I?

505
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,226
The faithfulness he talked of, madam.
Your enduring faithfulness.

506
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,316
Now tell me truly.

507
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,712
When you found out he was gone, did you
get engaged to your prince that same hour,

508
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,923
or did you wait a whole week
out of respect for the dead?

509
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,610
You mocked me once!
Never do it again!

510
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,110
I died that day!

511
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,204
And you can die too, for all I care!

512
00:38:56,084 --> 00:39:00,078
As you wish!

513
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,585
Oh, my sweet Westley.
What have I done?

514
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,764
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

515
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,235
They disappeared.

516
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,110
He must've seen us closing in,
which might account for his panicking into error.

517
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,235
Unless I am wrong,
and I am never wrong,

518
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,738
they are headed
dead into the Fire Swamp.

519
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,010
- Can you move at all?
- Move?

520
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,760
You're alive.
If you want, I can fly.

521
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:03,566
I told you I would always come for you.
Why didn't you wait for me?

522
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,020
Well, you were dead.

523
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,230
Death cannot stop true love.

524
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,362
All it can do is delay it for a while.

525
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,996
I will never doubt again.

526
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,374
There will never be a need.

527
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,796
<i>Oh, no. No, please.</i>

528
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,965
What is it? What's the matter?

529
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,088
They're kissing again.

530
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,545
Do we have to hear the kissing part?

531
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,006
Someday you may not mind so much.

532
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,635
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.

533
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,388
- That sounded good.
- Oh.

534
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,519
You're sick. I'll humor ya.

535
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:48,019
So now, where were we here?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, okay.

536
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:53,073
<i>"Westley and Buttercup
raced along the ravine floor."</i>

537
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,775
Ha!

538
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,485
Your pig fiancé is too late.

539
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,324
A few more steps
and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.

540
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,701
We'll never survive.

541
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,004
Nonsense. You're only saying that
because no one ever has.

542
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,028
It's not that bad.

543
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,706
I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here,
but the trees are actually quite lovely.

544
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,531
Well, now, that was an adventure.

545
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,867
- Singed a bit, were you?
- You?

546
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,464
Well, one thing I will say.

547
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,171
Fire Swamp certainly does
keep you on your toes.

548
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,355
This will all soon be but a happy memory

549
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,184
because Roberts' ship, <i>Revenge,</i>
is anchored at the far end.

550
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,485
And I, as you know, am Roberts.

551
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,314
But how is that possible
since he's been marauding 20 years

552
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,524
and you only left me five years ago?

553
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,577
I, myself, am often surprised
at life's little quirks.

554
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,158
See, what I told you before
about saying "please" was true.

555
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,084
It intrigued Roberts,
as did my descriptions of your beauty.

556
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,211
Finally Roberts decided something.

557
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,463
He said, "All right, Westley.

558
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,341
I've never had a valet.
You can try it for tonight.

559
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,297
I'll most likely kill you in the morning."

560
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,926
Three years he said that.

561
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,851
"Good night, Westley. Good work.

562
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,521
Sleep well. I'll most likely
kill you in the morning."

563
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,224
It was a fine time for me.
I was learning to fence, to fight.

564
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,184
Anything anyone would teach me.

565
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,770
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends.

566
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,901
- And then it happened.
- What?

567
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,237
Go on.

568
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,740
Well, Roberts had grown so rich
he wanted to retire,

569
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,823
so he took me to his cabin
and told me his secret.

570
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,585
"I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts,"
he said.

571
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,086
"My name is Ryan.

572
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,006
I inherited the ship
from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts,

573
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,004
just as you will inherit it from me.

574
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,974
The man I inherited it from was not
the real Dread Pirate Roberts either.

575
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,130
His name was Cumberbund.

576
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:06,558
The real Roberts has been retired 15 years
and living like a king in Patagonia."

577
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,644
Thank you.

578
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,310
Then he explained the name

579
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,390
was the important thing
for inspiring the necessary fear.

580
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,227
You see, no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

581
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,943
So we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew,

582
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:24,527
and he stayed aboard for a while as first mate,
all the time calling me Roberts.

583
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,954
Once the crew believed, he left the ship
and I have been Roberts ever since.

584
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,827
Except now that we're together, I shall retire
and hand the name over to someone else.

585
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,786
Is everything clear to you?

586
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,258
We'll never succeed.

587
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,559
We may as well die here.

588
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:18,440
No. No. We have already succeeded.

589
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,984
I mean, what are the three terrors
of the Fire Swamp?

590
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,816
One, the flame spurt. No problem.

591
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,278
There's a popping sound preceding each.
We can avoid that.

592
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:34,411
Two, the lightning sand. But you were
clever enough to discover what that looks like.

593
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,412
So in the future we can avoid that too.

594
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,960
Westley, what about the ROUS's?

595
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,289
Rodents of Unusual Size?
I don't think they exist.

596
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,081
Westley!

597
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,739
We did it.

598
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,494
Now, was that so terrible?

599
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,176
Surrender!

600
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,301
You mean you wish to surrender to me?
Very well. I accept.

601
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:59,806
I give you full marks for bravery.
Don't make yourself a fool.

602
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:03,263
Ah, but how will you capture us?
We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp.

603
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:07,277
We can live there quite happily for some time,
so whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.

604
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,403
I tell you once again. Surrender!

605
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,821
It will not happen.

606
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,024
For the last time! Surrender!

607
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,404
Death first!

608
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,451
Will you promise not to hurt him?

609
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,538
What was that?

610
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,992
What was that?

611
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,242
If we surrender and I return with you,

612
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,623
will you promise not to hurt this man?

613
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:30,253
May I live a thousand years
and never hunt again.

614
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,426
He is a sailor on the pirate ship <i>Revenge.</i>

615
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,674
Promise to return him to his ship.

616
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,257
I swear it will be done.

617
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:44,768
Once we are out of sight, take him back to Florin
and throw him in the Pit of Despair.

618
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,474
I swear it will be done.

619
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,733
I thought you were dead once,
and it almost destroyed me.

620
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,989
I could not bear it if you died again,

621
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,863
not when I could save you.

622
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,251
Come, sir.

623
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,584
We must get you to your ship.

624
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,551
We are men of action.

625
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,602
Lies do not become us.

626
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,055
Well spoken, sir.

627
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,817
- What is it?
- You have six fingers on your right hand.

628
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,069
Someone was looking for you.

629
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:30,160
- Where am I?
- The Pit of Despair.

630
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:34,874
Don't even think...

631
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,092
Don't even think about trying to escape.

632
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,965
The chains are far too thick.

633
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,047
And don't dream of being rescued either.

634
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,303
The only way in is secret.

635
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:48,012
Only the prince, the count, and I
know how to get in and out.

636
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,892
Then I'm here till I die?

637
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,814
Till they kill you. Yeah.

638
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,151
Then why bother curing me?

639
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:03,861
Well, the prince and the count always insist
on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

640
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,411
So it's to be torture?

641
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,949
I can cope with torture.

642
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,036
You don't believe me?

643
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,874
You survived the Fire Swamp.
You must be very brave.

644
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,919
But nobody withstands the Machine.

645
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,811
She's been like that
ever since the Fire Swamp.

646
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,774
It's my father's failing health
that's upsetting her.

647
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,276
Of course.

648
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,368
<i>"The king died that very night.</i>

649
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,825
<i>And before the following dawn,</i>

650
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,457
<i>Buttercup and Humperdinck were married.</i>

651
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:58,711
<i>And at noon, she met her subjects again,
this time as their queen."</i>

652
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,293
My father's final words were...

653
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,299
<i>Hold it. Hold it. Grandpa.</i>

654
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,177
You read that wrong.
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.

655
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,849
She marries Westley. I'm just sure of it.

656
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:14,022
After all that Westley did for her,
if she didn't marry him, it wouldn't be fair.

657
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,943
Well, who says life is fair?
Where is that written?

658
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,439
Life isn't always fair.

659
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,490
I'm telling you, you're messing up the story!
Now, get it right!

660
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,783
Do you want me to go on with this?

661
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:29,329
- Yes.
- All right, then. No more interruptions.

662
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:34,080
"At noon, she met her subjects again,
this time as their queen."

663
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,912
My father's final words were:

664
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:42,968
"Love her as I loved her,
and there will be joy."

665
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,012
I present to you your queen,

666
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,633
Queen Buttercup.

667
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:04,656
Boo! Boo!

668
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,075
Boo!

669
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,618
Why do you do this?

670
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:12,539
Because you had love in your hands,
and you gave it up!

671
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,037
But they would've killed Westley
if I hadn't done it.

672
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:18,962
Your true love lives,
and you marry another!

673
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,963
True love saved her in the Fire Swamp,
and she treated it like garbage.

674
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,636
And that's what she is,
the Queen of Refuse!

675
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,386
So bow down to her, if you want.
Bow to her.

676
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:34,015
Bow to the Queen of Slime,
the Queen of Filth,

677
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,391
the Queen of Putrescence!

678
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,690
Boo! Boo!

679
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,234
Rubbish! Filth! Slime!

680
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,152
Muck! Boo!

681
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,106
Boo! Boo!

682
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,458
<i>"It was ten days till the wedding.</i>

683
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:56,458
<i>The king still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares
were growing steadily worse."</i>

684
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,832
<i>See? Didn't I tell you she'd
never marry that rotten Humperdinck?</i>

685
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,084
<i>Yes, you're very smart. Shut up.</i>

686
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:07,005
I love Westley. I always have.

687
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,466
I know now I always will.

688
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,515
If you tell me I must marry you in ten days,

689
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,184
please believe I will be dead by morning.

690
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,649
I could never cause you grief.

691
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,698
Consider our wedding off.

692
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:33,324
You, um, returned this Westley to his ship?

693
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,121
- Yes.
- Then we will simply alert him.

694
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,037
Beloved...

695
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,795
are you certain he still wants you?

696
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,838
After all, it was you who did the leaving
in the Fire Swamp,

697
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:52,298
not to mention that, um, pirates
are not known to be men of their words.

698
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,849
My Westley will always come for me.

699
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,935
Ah.

700
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,312
I suggest a deal.

701
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,478
You write four copies of a letter.

702
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,940
I'll send my four fastest ships,
one in each direction.

703
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,322
The Dread Pirate Roberts is always
close to Florin this time of year.

704
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:16,280
We'll run up the white flag
and deliver your message.

705
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,617
If Westley wants you, bless you both.

706
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,327
If not...

707
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,050
please consider me
as an alternative to suicide.

708
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,919
Are we agreed?

709
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:39,098
Your princess
is really quite a winning creature.

710
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,679
A trifle simple, perhaps,
but her appeal is undeniable.

711
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,605
I know.
The people are quite taken with her.

712
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,729
It's odd,

713
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,778
but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered
on our engagement day,

714
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,355
I thought that was clever.

715
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:54,284
But it's going to be so much more moving
when I strangle her on our wedding night.

716
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,862
Once Guilder is blamed,
the nation will be truly outraged.

717
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,039
They'll demand we go to war.

718
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,878
Now, where is that secret knot?

719
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,585
It's impossible to find.

720
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,212
Ah. Are you coming down into the pit?

721
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:18,346
Westley's got his strength back.
I'm starting him on the Machine tonight.

722
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,635
Tyrone,

723
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,016
you know how much I love
watching you work.

724
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,644
But I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan,

725
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:29,774
my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder,
and Guilder to frame for it.

726
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,525
I'm swamped.

727
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,276
Get some rest.

728
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,283
If you haven't got your health,
you haven't got anything.

729
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,300
Beautiful, isn't it?

730
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,635
Took me half a lifetime to invent it.

731
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,935
I'm sure you've discovered
my deep and abiding interest in pain.

732
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,188
At present, I'm writing
the definitive work on the subject.

733
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:13,567
So I want you to be totally honest with me
on how the Machine makes you feel.

734
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:18,152
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.

735
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:58,321
As you know, the concept
of the suction pump is centuries old.

736
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:03,155
Well, really, that's all this is,
except that instead of sucking water,

737
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,739
I'm sucking life.

738
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,789
I've just sucked one year of your life away.

739
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,162
I might one day go as high as five,

740
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,919
but I really don't know
what that would do to you.

741
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:17,047
So let's just start with what we have.

742
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,384
What did this do to you? Tell me.

743
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:24,263
And remember,
this is for posterity, so be honest.

744
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,847
How do you feel?

745
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,433
Interesting.

746
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,904
- Yellin.
- Sire.

747
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,710
As chief enforcer of all Florin,
I trust you with this secret.

748
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,589
Killers from Guilder
are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest

749
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:06,551
and plan to murder my bride
on our wedding night.

750
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:10,184
My spy network has heard no such news.

751
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,390
Any word from Westley?

752
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,735
Too soon, my angel.

753
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,525
- Patience.
- He will come for me.

754
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,402
Of course.

755
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,197
She will not be murdered.

756
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,283
On the day of the wedding,
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied

757
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,585
and every inhabitant arrested.

758
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,754
Many of the thieves will resist.

759
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,082
My regular enforcers will be inadequate.

760
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,258
Form a brute squad then!

761
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:42,382
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied
before I wed.

762
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,088
It won't be easy, sire.

763
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,265
Try ruling the world sometime.

764
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,393
<i>"The day of the wedding arrived.</i>

765
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,726
<i>The brute squad had their hands full
carrying out Humperdinck's orders."</i>

766
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,693
- Is everybody out?
- Almost.

767
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,779
There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble.

768
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,160
Well, you give <i>him</i> some trouble.

769
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,329
Move.

770
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,290
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.

771
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,470
You told me to go back to the beginning,
so I have.

772
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,349
This is where I am,
and this is where I'll stay.

773
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,602
I will not be moved.

774
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,974
Ho there!

775
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,394
I do not budge. Keep your "Ho there."

776
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,975
But the prince gave orders.

777
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,609
So did Vizzini.

778
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,112
When a job went wrong,
you went back to the beginning.

779
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:48,866
Well, this is where we got the job,
so it's the beginning,

780
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,947
and I am staying till Vizzini comes.

781
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,703
You, brute, come here!

782
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:57,912
I am waiting for Vizzini.

783
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,498
You surely are a meanie.

784
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,132
Hello.

785
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,844
- It's you.
- True.

786
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,936
You don't look so good.

787
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,609
Phew. You don't smell so good either.

788
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:25,239
- Perhaps not. I feel fine.
- Yeah?

789
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,945
<i>"Fezzik and Inigo were reunited.</i>

790
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,749
<i>And as Fezzik nursed
his inebriated friend back to health,</i>

791
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,202
<i>he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
and the existence of Count Rugen,</i>

792
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,787
<i>the six-fingered man.</i>

793
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,835
<i>Considering Inigo's lifelong search,
he handled the news surprisingly well.</i>

794
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,423
<i>Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo."</i>

795
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,059
That's enough! That's enough!

796
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,138
Where is this Rugen now so I may kill him?

797
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,349
He's with the prince in the castle.

798
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,435
But the castle gate is guarded by 30 men.

799
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,900
How many could you handle?

800
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,985
I don't think more than ten.

801
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,579
Leaving 20 for me.

802
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,332
At my best, I could never defeat that many.

803
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,093
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.

804
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,841
But Vizzini's dead.

805
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,474
No. Not Vizzini.

806
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,348
I need the man in black.

807
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,519
What?

808
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,432
Look, he bested you with strength,
your greatness.

809
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:45,440
He bested me with steel.
He must have outthought Vizzini.

810
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,524
And a man who can do that
can plan my castle onslaught any day.

811
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,324
- Let's go.
- Where?

812
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,131
- Find the man in black, obviously.
- But you don't know where he is.

813
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,912
Don't bother me with trifles.

814
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,662
After 20 years, at last
my father's soul will be at peace.

815
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,914
There will be blood tonight!

816
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,719
Rise and report.

817
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,472
The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
Thirty men guard the castle gate.

818
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,726
Double it. My princess must be safe.

819
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,898
The gate has but one key...

820
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,231
and I carry that.

821
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,108
Ah, my dulcet darling.

822
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,116
Tonight, we marry.

823
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,574
Tomorrow morning,
your men will escort us to Florin Channel,

824
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:44,913
where every ship in my armada waits
to accompany us on our honeymoon.

825
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,498
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.

826
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,378
Every ship but the four you sent.

827
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,759
Yes. Yes, of course.

828
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,431
Naturally, not those four.

829
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,102
Your Majesty.

830
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,766
You never sent the ships.

831
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,435
Don't bother lying.

832
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,902
Doesn't matter.
Westley will come for me anyway.

833
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,823
You're a silly girl.

834
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,027
Yes, I am a silly girl

835
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,659
for not having seen sooner
that you were nothing but a coward

836
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,740
with a heart full of fear.

837
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,582
I would not say such things if I were you.

838
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,540
Why not? You can't hurt me.

839
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,502
Westley and I are joined
by the bonds of love.

840
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:37,136
And you cannot track that,
not with a thousand bloodhounds.

841
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:41,185
And you cannot break it,
not with a thousand swords.

842
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,479
And when I say you're a coward,

843
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:47,434
that is only because you are the slimiest
weakling ever to crawl the earth!

844
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:53,110
I would not say such things if I were you!

845
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,836
You truly love each other,
and so you might have been truly happy.

846
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,293
Not one couple in a century
has that chance,

847
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,344
no matter what the storybooks say.

848
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:19,765
And so, I think no man in a century

849
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,468
will suffer as greatly as you will.

850
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:29,312
Not to 50!

851
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,539
Fezzik. Fezzik, listen.

852
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:55,502
Do you hear?
That is the sound of ultimate suffering.

853
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:59,009
My heart made that sound
when Rugen slaughtered my father.

854
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,715
- The man in black makes it now.
- The man in black?

855
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,801
His true love is marrying another tonight.

856
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,387
So who else has the cause
for ultimate suffering?

857
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:10,350
Excuse me. Pardon me.
It's important. Fezzik, please.

858
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,480
Everybody, move!

859
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,729
Thank you.

860
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,997
Where is the man in black?

861
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,291
You get there from this grove, yes?

862
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,291
Fezzik, jog his memory.

863
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:40,384
I'm sorry, Inigo.
I didn't mean to jog him so hard.

864
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:42,840
Inigo?

865
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,021
Father, I have failed you for 20 years.

866
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,848
Now our misery can end.

867
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,684
Somewhere...

868
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,942
Somewhere close by
is a man who can help us.

869
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,401
I cannot find him alone.

870
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,201
I need you.

871
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,323
I need you to guide my sword.

872
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,908
Please.

873
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,836
Guide my sword.

874
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,550
He's dead.

875
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,049
This is not fair.

876
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,557
Grandpa, Grandpa, wait. Wait.

877
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,764
What did Fezzik mean, "He's dead"?

878
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:16,350
I mean, he didn't mean <i>dead.</i>

879
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,945
Westley's only faking, right?

880
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,652
You want me to read this or not?

881
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,861
- Who gets Humperdinck?
- I don't understand.

882
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:31,494
Who kills Prince Humperdinck?
At the end. Somebody's gotta do it.

883
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,246
Is it Inigo? Who?

884
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:36,124
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

885
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,750
He lives.

886
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,672
You mean he wins?

887
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,627
Jesus, Grandpa!
What did you read me this thing for?

888
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:47,348
You know, you've been very sick,
and you're taking this story very seriously.

889
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,265
I think we ought to stop now.

890
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:53,016
No, I-I'm okay. I'm okay.

891
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:55,268
Sit down. I'm all right.

892
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,309
Okay.

893
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,645
All right, now, let's see. Where were we?

894
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,980
Oh, yes.

895
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,363
In the Pit of Despair.

896
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:12,748
Well, the Montoyas
have never taken defeat easily.

897
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,998
- Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
- The body?

898
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:19,163
- Have you any money?
- I have a little.

899
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,250
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle,
that's all.

900
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:29,097
Go away!

901
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,727
What? What?

902
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,647
Are you the Miracle Max
who worked for the king all those years?

903
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,816
The king's stinking son fired me.

904
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,484
And thank you so much
for bringing up such a painful subject.

905
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,842
While you're at it, why don't you give me
a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?

906
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,027
We're closed!

907
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,570
Beat it, or I'll call the brute squad.

908
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,702
- I'm on the brute squad.
- You <i>are</i> the brute squad.

909
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,034
We need a miracle. It's very important.

910
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,744
Look, I'm retired.

911
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:01,797
And besides, why would you want someone
the king's stinking son fired?

912
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,966
I might kill whoever you wanted me
to miracle.

913
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,417
He's already dead.

914
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,670
He is, huh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.

915
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,062
I've seen worse.

916
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,697
Sir?

917
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,654
Sir?

918
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,411
- Huh?
- We're in a terrible rush.

919
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,867
Don't rush me, sonny.

920
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,373
You rush a miracle man,
you get rotten miracles.

921
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,796
- You got money?
- Sixty-five.

922
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:45,499
Sheesh! I never worked for so little.

923
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:48,256
Except once,
and that was a very noble cause.

924
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,508
This is noble, sir.

925
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,557
His wife is crippled.

926
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,265
His children are on the brink of starvation.

927
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,600
Are you a rotten liar.

928
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:03,559
I need him to help avenge my father,
murdered these 20 years.

929
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:06,361
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows cramp?

930
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,690
He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.

931
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,366
He's dead. He can't talk.

932
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:14,616
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Look who knows so much, huh?

933
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:19,120
Well, it just so happens
that your friend here is only mostly dead.

934
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,328
There's a big difference
between mostly dead and all dead.

935
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,083
Please, open his mouth.

936
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:29,502
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive.

937
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,427
Now, all dead...

938
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,757
Well, with all dead, there's usually
only one thing that you can do.

939
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:35,716
What's that?

940
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,302
Go through his clothes
and look for loose change.

941
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,601
Hey!

942
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,482
Hello in there!

943
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:50,110
Hey! What's so important?

944
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,987
What you got here that's worth living for?

945
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,662
True love.

946
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:04,085
True love. You heard him. You could not ask
for a more noble cause than that.

947
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:08,632
Eh, sonny, true love
is the greatest thing in the world,

948
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,209
except for a nice MLT...

949
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:13,421
mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich,
when the mutton is nice and lean

950
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,380
and the tomato is ripe.

951
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,181
They're so perky. I love that.

952
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:21,057
But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said, "To blave."

953
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:24,060
And as we all know,
"to blave" means "to bluff." Huh?

954
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,211
So you were probably playing cards,
and he cheated...

955
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:29,353
Liar! Liar! Liar!

956
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,985
- Get back, witch!
- I'm not a witch! I'm your wife!

957
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,784
But after what you just said,
I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.

958
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,783
- You never had it so good.
- "True love." He said "true love," Max.

959
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,331
- Don't say another word, Valerie.
- My God, he's afraid.

960
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,535
Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him,
his confidence is shattered.

961
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:47,667
Why'd you say that name? You promised me
that you would never say that name!

962
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,248
- What, Humperdinck?
- Aaah!

963
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,584
Humperdinck! Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

964
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:55,296
- Humperdinck! Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
- I'm not listening!

965
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:59,679
True love lies expiring, and you don't have
the decency to say why you won't help.

966
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,352
- Nobody's hearing nothing.
- Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

967
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,958
This is Buttercup's true love.

968
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,731
If you heal him,
he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.

969
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,059
- Humperdinck!
- Shut up! Wait, wait.

970
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,815
I make him better, Humperdinck suffers?

971
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:13,613
Humiliations galore.

972
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,621
That is a noble cause.
Give me the 65. I'm on the job.

973
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,706
Whoo-hoo!

974
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,119
That's a miracle pill?

975
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,000
The chocolate coating
makes it go down easier.

976
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:33,255
But you have to wait 15 minutes
for full potency.

977
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:36,132
And you shouldn't go in swimming after
for at least, what?

978
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,760
- An hour. A good hour. Yeah.
- Yeah, an hour.

979
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,806
- Thank you for everything.
- Okay.

980
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:44,679
- Bye-bye, boys.
- Have fun storming the castle.

981
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:47,185
- Think it'll work?
- It would take a miracle.

982
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,765
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

983
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,160
Inigo, there's more than 30.

984
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,082
What's the difference?

985
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:08,285
We've got him.

986
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:10,082
Help me here.

987
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,582
- We'll have to force-feed him.
- Has it been 15 minutes?

988
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,168
We can't wait.
The wedding's in half an hour.

989
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,470
We must strike in the hustle
and the bustle beforehand.

990
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,047
Tilt his head back.

991
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,799
Open his mouth.

992
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,349
How long do we have to wait
before we know if the miracle works?

993
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,184
Your guess is as good as mine.

994
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,520
I'll beat you two apart.
I'll take you both together!

995
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,479
I guess not very long.

996
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:41,448
- Why won't my arms move?
- You've been mostly dead all day.

997
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:45,288
We had Miracle Max make a pill
to bring you back.

998
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,408
Who are you? Are we enemies?

999
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,415
Why am I on this wall? Where's Buttercup?

1000
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:52,996
Let me explain.

1001
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,207
No, there is too much. Let me sum up.

1002
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,089
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
in a little less than half an hour,

1003
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:00,262
so all we have to do is get in,
break up the wedding,

1004
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,054
steal the princess, make our escape,

1005
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,928
after I kill Count Rugen.

1006
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:06,351
That doesn't leave much time
for dillydallying.

1007
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:09,771
You just wiggled your finger.
That's wonderful.

1008
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,691
I've always been a quick healer.
What are our liabilities?

1009
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:16,361
There is but one working castle gate.
Come here.

1010
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,280
And it is guarded by... 60 men.

1011
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:26,579
- And our assets?
- Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.

1012
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,749
That's it? Impossible.

1013
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:33,249
If I had a month to plan, maybe I could
come up with something, but this...

1014
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,878
You just shook your head.
That doesn't make you happy?

1015
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:44,473
My brains, his steel, and your strength
against 60 men,

1016
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,801
and you think a little head jiggle
is supposed to make me happy, hmm?

1017
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:51,976
If we only had a wheelbarrow,
that would be something.

1018
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,142
Where did we put that wheelbarrow
the Albino had?

1019
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,852
Over the Albino, I think.

1020
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:01,030
Why didn't you list that among our assets
in the first place?

1021
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:04,827
What I wouldn't give
for a holocaust cloak.

1022
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,448
There we cannot help you.

1023
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,076
Will this do?

1024
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,624
- Where did you get that?
- At Miracle Max's.

1025
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,872
It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.

1026
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,171
All right, all right. Come on. Help me up.

1027
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:22,256
- Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
- Why? You can't even lift one.

1028
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,554
True, but that's hardly common knowledge,
is it?

1029
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:28,843
Thank you. Now, there may be problems
once we're inside.

1030
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,561
I'll say. How do I find the count?

1031
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,647
Once I do, how do I find you again?
Once I find you again, how do we escape?

1032
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:38,273
- Don't pester him. He's had a hard day.
- Right.

1033
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,319
Right. Sorry.

1034
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,238
- Inigo.
- What?

1035
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,115
I hope we win.

1036
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,531
<i>You don't seem excited, my little muffin.</i>

1037
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,327
- Should I be?
- Brides often are, I'm told.

1038
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,289
I do not marry tonight.

1039
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,292
My Westley will save me.

1040
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:55,137
Mawidge.

1041
01:18:55,773 --> 01:19:01,064
Mawidge is what bwings us togewer today.

1042
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:05,939
Mawidge, that bwessed awwangement,

1043
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:10,494
that dweam wiffin a dweam.

1044
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:14,323
Stand your ground, men!
Stand your ground!

1045
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,708
Stand your ground!

1046
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,666
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts!

1047
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,429
There will be no survivors!

1048
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,756
- Now?
- Not yet.

1049
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:36,311
My men are here, I am here,

1050
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:40,232
but soon <i>you</i> will not be here.

1051
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,267
- Now?
- Light him.

1052
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:50,738
The Dread Pirate Roberts
takes no survivors.

1053
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:56,199
All your worst nightmares
are about to come true!

1054
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,249
...ven wuv,

1055
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,748

fowever.

1058
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:08,339
The Dread Pirate Roberts

1059
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:12,343
is here for your souls!

1060
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,600
Stay where you are!

1061
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,598
Stand and fight!

1062
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,680
Stay where you are!

1063
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,645
So tweasuwe your wuv...

1064
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,446
Skip to the end.

1065
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,615
Have you the "wing"?

1066
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:34,115
Here comes my Westley now.

1067
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,036
Fezzik, the portcullis!

1068
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,413
Your Westley is dead.

1069
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:48,500
- I killed him myself.
- Then why is there fear behind your eyes?

1070
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,346
Give us the gate key.

1071
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:56,425
I have no gate key.

1072
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,101
Fezzik, tear his arms off.

1073
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,020
Oh, you mean this gate key.

1074
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,104
And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

1075
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,107
Man and wife! Say, "Man and wife!"

1076
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,109
Man and wife.

1077
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,234
Escort the bride to the honeymoon suite.
I'll be there shortly.

1078
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:18,329
He didn't come.

1079
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:56,777
Kill the dark one and the giant,
but leave the third for questioning.

1080
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:10,081
Hello.

1081
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,383
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1082
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,961
You killed my father.

1083
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,429
Prepare to die.

1084
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:44,207
Fezzik! I need you!

1085
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:45,784
I can't leave him alone.

1086
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:49,337
He's getting away from me, Fezzik! Please!

1087
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,295
Fezzik!

1088
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,586
I'll be right back.

1089
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:06,646
Thank you.

1090
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,724
- Strange wedding.
- Yes.

1091
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,810
A very strange wedding.

1092
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,229
Come along.

1093
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,486
What was that for?

1094
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,913
Because you've always been so kind to me.

1095
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,956
And I won't be seeing you again,

1096
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,002
since I'm killing myself
once we reach the honeymoon suite.

1097
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:34,000
Won't that be nice, hmm?
She kissed me!

1098
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,130
Sorry, Father.

1099
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,716
I tried.

1100
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,601
I tried.

1101
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,975
You must be that little Spanish brat
I taught a lesson to all those years ago.

1102
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:36,019
It's simply incredible.

1103
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:39,981
Have you been chasing me
your whole life only to fail now?

1104
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,284
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

1105
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,533
How marvelous.

1106
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,653
There's a shortage
of perfect breasts in this world.

1107
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:28,579
'Twould be a pity to damage yours.

1108
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,746
Westley! Oh, Westley, darling!

1109
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,748
Westley, why won't you hold me?

1110
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,417
- Gently.
- At a time like this?

1111
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,594
That's all you can think to say? "Gently"?

1112
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,467
Gently!

1113
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:02,356
Good heavens. Are you still trying to win?

1114
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,902
You've got an overdeveloped
sense of vengeance.

1115
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,827
It's going to get you into trouble someday.

1116
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:29,265
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.

1117
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,183
You killed my father.

1118
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,936
Prepare to die.

1119
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:41,522
Hello.

1120
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,071
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1121
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:46,240
You killed my father.

1122
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,113
Prepare to die.

1123
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,908
Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya.

1124
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:57,493
You killed my father. Prepare to die.

1125
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,624
Stop saying that!

1126
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:03,507
Aaah!

1127
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:06,301
Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya!

1128
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:09,005
You killed my father! Prepare to die!

1129
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,590
- No!
- Offer me money.

1130
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:13,472
- Yes.
- Power too. Promise me that.

1131
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,520
All that I have and more. Please.

1132
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,394
Offer me everything I ask for.

1133
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,476
Anything you want.

1134
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,527
I want my father back, you son of a bitch.

1135
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,040
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?

1136
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,296
What hideous sin have you committed lately?

1137
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:50,096
I got married. I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.

1138
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,889
- It never happened.
- What?

1139
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,183
- It never happened.
- But it did. I was there.

1140
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,977
- This old man said, "Man and wife."
- Did you say, "I do"?

1141
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,562
Uh, no. We sort of skipped that part.

1142
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:02,983
Then you're not married.

1143
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,903
If you didn't say it, you didn't do it.

1144
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,774
Wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?

1145
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,361
A technicality
that will shortly be remedied.

1146
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:16,747
But first things first.

1147
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,540
- To the death.
- No!

1148
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,121
To the pain.

1149
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,292
I don't think I'm quite familiar
with that phrase.

1150
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:28,385
I'll explain.

1151
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:31,508
And I'll use small words,
so that you'll be sure to understand,

1152
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,386
you warthog-faced buffoon.

1153
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:40,938
That may be the first time in my life
a man has dared insult me.

1154
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:43,357
It won't be the last.

1155
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:47,187
"To the pain" means the first thing you lose
will be your feet, below the ankles.

1156
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,613
Then your hands at the wrists.

1157
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,190
Next, your nose.

1158
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,025
And then my tongue, I suppose.

1159
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:58,205
I killed you too quickly the last time,
a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.

1160
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,657
I wasn't finished!

1161
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,619
The next thing you lose will be your left eye,
followed by your right.

1162
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,955
And then my ears.
I understand. Let's get on with it.

1163
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,417
Wrong! Your ears you keep,
and I'll tell you why.

1164
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:14,597
So that every shriek of every child
at seeing your hideousness

1165
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:17,300
will be yours to cherish.

1166
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,477
Every babe that weeps at your approach,

1167
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:22,601
every woman who cries out,
"Dear God, what is that thing?"

1168
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:25,479
will echo in your perfect ears.

1169
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,402
That is what "to the pain" means.

1170
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,980
It means I leave you in anguish,

1171
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:34,067
wallowing in freakish misery forever.

1172
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,324
I think you're bluffing.

1173
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:40,452
It's possible, pig.

1174
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,534
I might be bluffing.

1175
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:45,495
It's conceivable,
you miserable, vomitous mass,

1176
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:49,128
that I'm only lying here
because I lack the strength to stand.

1177
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,376
Then again...

1178
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,971
perhaps I have the strength after all.

1179
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,657
Drop... your... sword.

1180
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:20,414
Have a seat.

1181
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,411
Tie him up.

1182
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,831
Make it as tight as you like.

1183
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,008
Oh!

1184
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,716
Where's Fezzik?

1185
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:38,297
- I thought he was with you.
- No.

1186
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:40,098
In that case...

1187
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,266
Help him.

1188
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:44,972
- Why does Westley need helping?
- Because he has no strength.

1189
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,682
I knew it. I knew you were bluffing.
I knew he was bluffing.

1190
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,439
- Shall I dispatch him for you?
- Thank you, but no.

1191
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:53,942
Whatever happens to us, I want him
to live a long life alone with his cowardice.

1192
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:59,031
Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

1193
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,614
Oh, there you are.

1194
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:05,370
Inigo, I saw the prince's stables,

1195
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,373
and there they were... four white horses.

1196
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:13,174
And I thought, there are four of us,
if we ever find the lady.

1197
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,626
Hello, lady.

1198
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:19,047
So I took them with me,
in case we ever bumped into each other.

1199
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,552
I guess we just did.

1200
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,761
Fezzik, you did something right.

1201
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:27,892
Don't worry. I won't let it go to my head.

1202
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:50,377
You know, it's very strange.

1203
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,706
I have been in the revenge business so long,

1204
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,338
now that it's over,

1205
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,761
I don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

1206
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,055
Have you ever considered piracy?

1207
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,341
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

1208
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:18,985
<i>"They rode to freedom.</i>

1209
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:22,864
<i>And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe.</i>

1210
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,993
<i>A wave oflove swept over them.</i>

1211
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:28,369
<i>And as they reached for each other..."</i>

1212
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,415
What? What?

1213
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:34,963
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

1214
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:38,551
Well, I don't mind so much.

1215
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,837
Okay.

1216
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:47,097
<i>"Since the invention of the kiss,
there have been five kisses</i>

1217
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:50,180
<i>that were rated
the most passionate, the most pure.</i>

1218
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:53,270
<i>This one left them all behind.</i>

1219
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,230
The end."

1220
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:04,743
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.

1221
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:06,408
Okay.

1222
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:07,705
Okay.

1223
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,292
Okay.

1224
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:13,410
Okay.

1225
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:16,959
Okay.

1226
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,092
All right.

1227
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:23,671
So long.

1228
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:26,890
Grandpa?

1229
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:34,307
Maybe you could come over
and read it again to me tomorrow.

1230
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:38,319
As you wish.
