<b>Indecent Proposal (1993)

3
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:38,103
<i>Losing Diana was like</i>
<i>losing a part of me.</i>

4
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:43,606
<i>I thought nothing could change</i>
<i>the way we felt about each other.</i>

5
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:46,678
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

6
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:53,648
<i>Someone once said, "If you want</i>
<i>something very badly, set it free."</i>

7
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:57,985
<i>"If it comes back to you,</i>
<i>it's yours for ever."</i>

8
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:02,425
<i>"If it doesn't,</i>
<i>it was never yours to begin with."</i>

9
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:07,563
<i>I knew one thing.</i>
<i>I was David's to begin with.</i>

10
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:09,692
<i>And he was mine.</i>

11
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:14,664
Light up my life...

12
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,446
<i>We met in high school. David was</i>
<i>a senior and I was a freshman.</i>

13
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:24,607
<i>After glee club, he'd drive me and</i>
<i>my best friend home from school.</i>

14
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:28,378
<i>I used to watch him</i>
<i>in the rear-view mirror.</i>

15
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,615
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

16
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:41,459
<i>When I was 19 David proposed to</i>
<i>me on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

17
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,364
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

18
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,495
<i>They said we were too young,</i>
<i>we didn't know each other.</i>

19
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:52,337
<i>But David said that a life</i>
<i>without risk is like no life at all.</i>

20
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:54,947
<i>So we eloped.</i>

21
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:17,063
<i>I graduated from architecture school</i>
<i>and got a job at a small firm.</i>

22
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,503
<i>Diana helped support us</i>
<i>by selling real estate.</i>

23
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:25,176
<i>I spent all my free time</i>
<i>working on a design of my own.</i>

24
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:28,679
<i>It summed up everything about</i>
<i>architecture that really mattered.</i>

25
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,875
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

26
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:04,951
D?

27
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:11,279
Have I ever told you I love you?

28
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:13,676
No.

29
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:17,195
- I do.
- Still?

30
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,096
Always.

31
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:24,866
<i>We had our differences.</i>

32
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:29,806
<i>He'd take his clothes off and leave</i>
<i>them on the floor. It made me crazy.</i>

33
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,524
What do you think this is?
Leaving your shoes on the table?

34
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:58,502
- I don't need to do your laundry.
- I will pick it up. Don't get violent.

35
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:01,573
- What about this?
- Now, you put that down.

36
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:04,802
- You're going to hurt somebody.
- I am going to hurt somebody?

37
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:07,243
You're out of your mind!

38
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:09,575
OK, now. Fine.

39
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,653
Goddamn it!

40
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:17,848
Now, come on. Let's just relax.

41
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:20,323
- Did I hurt you?
- No. I am all right.

42
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:24,419
- I am sorry.
- Really? You were kidding?

43
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,474
D, your pants are on fire.

44
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,701
You have no idea.

45
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,793
<i>We had no money, so for entertainment</i>
<i>David showed me architecture he liked.</i>

46
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,992
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask,</i>

47
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,832
<i>"Why are we looking at</i>
<i>a stupid car wash?"</i>

48
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,305
<i>And he'd just say, "No, not stupid."</i>

49
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,070
<i>"Don't just use your eyes."</i>

50
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,203
<i>He made me look at things</i>
<i>differently.</i>

51
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,918
David, this is a steal. It just came in.
Nobody knows about it yet.

52
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,316
It's beautiful.

53
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:58,117
Build a house here.
You'd make a name for yourself,

54
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,785
because the house will be brilliant,
being by David Murphy.

55
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:06,228
<i>I found an incredible piece of property</i>
<i>in Santa Monica, by the ocean.</i>

56
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:09,130
<i>It was the perfect site</i>
<i>for David's house.</i>

57
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,066
We will borrow the money.

58
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:15,334
These leverage stockbroker buyout
guys, you should see the junk they buy.

59
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,638
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

60
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:23,613
<i>It was brilliant, even though</i>
<i>I didn't understand a word of it.</i>

61
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,945
<i>We had to economise</i>
<i>for the loan payments,</i>

62
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,112
<i>but it was our future</i>
<i>and I got to build my house.</i>

63
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:35,622
<i>And then the recession hit.</i>

64
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:41,901
<i>The real-estate market dried up.</i>
<i>I hadn't closed a sale in six months.</i>

65
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,401
<i>Construction fell to its lowest point</i>
<i>in years.</i>

66
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:48,064
<i>People were being laid off everywhere,</i>
<i>and I was one of them.</i>

67
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:52,008
- I feel really bad about this.
- I don't understand. What happened?

68
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,080
The bank has called in
the demand note.

69
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,705
Can they do that?

70
00:07:56,705 --> 00:08:01,344
You don't have any income right now,
so they could attach your assets.

71
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:04,485
What assets?

72
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,189
Your house.

73
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,597
got to keep up those payments.

74
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,164
I am sorry.

75
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:31,042
David, I am scared.

76
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,189
We don't have any money.
What are we going to do?

77
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,160
I will wait tables or drive a cab
or something. I don't know.

78
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,673
I will take care of you.

79
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,246
Make it go away.

80
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:15,122
<i>I was desperate.</i>
<i>We stood to lose everything:</i>

81
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,856
<i>The house I'd been building,</i>
<i>even our own home.</i>

82
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:22,798
<i>I swallowed my pride and borrowed</i>
<i>$5,000 from my father.</i>

83
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:25,632
<i>It wasn't enough.</i>

84
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,297
<i>We needed $50,000.</i>

85
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:42,648
- D...
- What?

86
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:47,283
- Get up. Get dressed. I got an idea.
- What time is it?

87
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:16,549
Hi! How you doing?

88
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,626
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

89
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,755
Oh, honey!
That's the spirit!

90
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:30,927
Keep them coming! 50,000 of them,
that's what we want! We're winners!

91
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,938
Put some money in the kitty!

92
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:49,952
We got a shooter now, folks.
A lucky lady shooter.

93
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:52,751
Stack it, don't rack it.

94
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,851
And I have a lovely...

95
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,579
Why don't you put it on?
It suits you.

96
00:12:58,484 --> 00:13:00,679
Well, I can't afford it.

97
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:06,023
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

98
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:15,725
I really think you ought
to have the dress. Let me buy it for you.

99
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,701
You want to buy me this dress?

100
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,601
Yeah.

101
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:25,407
- Why?
- I have enjoyed watching you.

102
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:26,842
You have earned it.

103
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,809
No, I haven't.

104
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:37,020
The dress is for sale. I am not.

105
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:53,599
Roll them now, girlfriend!

106
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:08,019
I can't lose. I am up over $9,000.

107
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,262
$9,000 up! This is my wife D.

108
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:22,663
These are my girls.
They're going to be moving in.

109
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,935
Kiss them.

110
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,839
- Yeah.
- Bets, please.

111
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:44,989
- Did I ever tell you I love you?
- No.

112
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,386
- I do.
- Still?

113
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,925
Always.

114
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:09,476
5,000.

115
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:13,779
This little pile here, you guessed it.
Five more, D.

116
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,650
What do you think this is?
Five more.

117
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:21,817
Play with it. Roll around with it.
Enjoy yourself. Oh, my!

118
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:27,560
And the grand total is...

119
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,289
...$25,040.

120
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:37,103
So we're halfway there, like in an hour.

121
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:43,011
I figure about two hours tomorrow,
we will be home free.

122
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,616
Come here.

123
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,594
What?

124
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,507
I love you.

125
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,642
I know that.

126
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:18,575
No, I mean even without the money.

127
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:52,434
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

128
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,144
Come on, black, come on.
Here we go.

129
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,444
Yes!

130
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:14,694
No more bets, please.

131
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,606
Yes, we won!

132
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:53,595
$4,100.
We said we wouldn't go below $5,000.

133
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,003
Do you want any more coffee?

134
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,076
No, thank you.

135
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,356
Tails we quit. Heads we go for it.

136
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,214
Two out of three.

137
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,618
Last call for wagers.

138
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,248
No more bets.

139
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:49,589
OK. I am feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

140
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,595
All of it. Red.

141
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,665
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

142
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:58,702
We can do this, huh?

143
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,307
I am going to put it on.
I am putting it on red.

144
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:08,964
OK.

145
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:33,236
- No, it's black.
- What are you doing?

146
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,738
- It's black.
- What are you doing?

147
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,013
No, it's red.
Go with your instinct. Right?

148
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:47,347
- No more bets.
- Come on, man.

149
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:52,248
got to get it.

150
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,420
OK, come on red, come on red.

151
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:07,529
Too late, young lady.

152
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:49,211
Place your bets.
Bank side, player side.

153
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,646
All set? Cards, please.

154
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:57,017
Turning for the players.

155
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,917
Passes to the right, please.

156
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:06,228
Player draws nothing.

157
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,108
And set.

158
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:21,813
Player side, banker side.

159
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:26,483
- Who's that guy?
- That's John Gage.

160
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:30,214
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son of a bitch right there.

161
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,984
He's down over
a million dollars already.

162
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,685
You see them little gold things
he's playing with?

163
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:38,126
$10,000 apiece.

164
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:41,461
Every time he lays one down,
10,000 big ones.

165
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:46,264
Look how cool he is. He must get more
pussy than you can shake a stick at.

166
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:50,000
- I am sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
- Player wins.

167
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,633
It's about time.

168
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:55,440
- You all married?
- Yeah.

169
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,041
- Stick around and gamble a little.
- Excuse me! Excuse me.

170
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:05,617
Would you mind lending me your wife?
Is that your wife?

171
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,157
Excuse me?

172
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:12,930
- For luck.
- Well, you'd have to ask her.

173
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,329
- May I?
- Go for it.

174
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,700
I don't think it's a good idea.
We should go.

175
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,137
- Just for a moment?
- I will go.

176
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,574
Go ahead. It might be fun.
What have we got to lose?

177
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:29,681
- Well?
- Go and see what happens.

178
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:33,080
- Yeah, go ahead.
- We will be here, backing you up.

179
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,578
Thank you.

180
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:38,713
See if you can get
a little of that money from him.

181
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:42,384
Do you think she will ever come back?

182
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,996
I am just bullshitting you.

183
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:50,431
Have a seat.
I have been losing all day long.

184
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:54,699
Then you appeared and I won
my first hand. You brought me luck.

185
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,308
I'd say that's a sign.

186
00:23:57,308 --> 00:23:59,411
Wouldn't you?

187
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:04,647
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

188
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:06,844
Candy?

189
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:12,685
Place your bets.

190
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,588
100,000.

191
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:20,121
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

192
00:24:25,938 --> 00:24:28,998
- Not like that.
- Sorry.

193
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,807
All bets set? Cards, please.

194
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:40,812
Turning for the players.

195
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,352
Now, what we want...

196
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:46,483
What we need... is a nine.

197
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:54,664
We don't like that.

198
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:58,760
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

199
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,702
Bank's the winner with a natural eight.
Pay the bank.

200
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:08,410
I guess I am not so lucky after all.

201
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,347
- Do you like cards?
- Not especially.

202
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:16,114
Wish I'd asked you sooner. Dice?

203
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:19,482
Yeah, I guess.

204
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:26,024
- Sam.
- Mr. G?

205
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,328
One.

206
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,936
Excuse me, Mr. G.

207
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:44,339
- Maybe I should go.
- This shouldn't take too long.

208
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,043
- What?
- This.

209
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:55,391
Now...

210
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,863
I hope you find this interesting.

211
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:02,157
Pit. Tadross.

212
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:05,828
Yes, sir. It's here now.

213
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:20,610
- Goes for one million dollars.
- It's a bet.

214
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:26,416
Here you are, Mr. G.
One million dollars.

215
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,613
Bet it all.

216
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:21,042
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven
this time. It is a come-out roll.

217
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:23,113
How much goes, now? Get them down.

218
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:25,273
Pick two.

219
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,751
Now just throw a seven.

220
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:37,858
If you want to throw an eleven,
that's all right too.

221
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:45,333
Aren't you forgetting something?

222
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:07,457
Winner!

223
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:24,165
Think I ought to quit now?

224
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,371
I think I should.

225
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,475
Credit my account.

226
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:37,551
Sweetie, that was incredible.
Unbelievable.

227
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,850
Hi. John Gage.

228
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,825
- Hi. David Murphy.
- Hi, David.

229
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:46,158
Congratulations.
This is my wife Diana. I guess you met.

230
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,495
- Hi. Diana?
- Diana.

231
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:53,799
Thank you both. Very generous of you,
David. Are you staying at the hotel?

232
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,272
- No. Actually we're just leaving.
- Yes, we're on our way out.

233
00:28:57,272 --> 00:29:01,539
No, don't do that. We got to celebrate.
Let me arrange a room for you here.

234
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:04,741
- That's very nice, but...
- No, I insist.

235
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,852
Please. It's the least I can do. OK?

236
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:10,978
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

237
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:13,819
There's some lovely shops
off the lobby.

238
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,551
Have you seen them?

239
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:19,586
Let's go.

240
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,201
How about that?

241
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:37,715
Wow.

242
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,884
D, what do you think?

243
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,050
Godfather?

244
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:51,293
You won a million dollars today.

245
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,060
- He won it.
- Honey, you won it for him.

246
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:05,705
This feels nice.

247
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:09,442
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

248
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:10,192
OK.

249
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,527
Hello. William Shackleford.

250
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,925
Hi. David Murphy.

251
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:29,362
For Mrs. Murphy. From John Gage.

252
00:30:30,802 --> 00:30:32,599
Well, thank him for us.

253
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:37,107
I will do that. Mr. Gage is hosting a
gathering tonight in his suite at nine.

254
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:41,144
If you can find the time in your
schedule, he'd be most pleased.

255
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:45,516
- Look what you got.
- What?

256
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,212
Gift from Gage.

257
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,478
Really?

258
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:54,785
Well, open it up.

259
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,532
That's $5,000.

260
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:11,368
How do you know that?

261
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:14,001
I saw it in the store downstairs.

262
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:20,279
- Lucky for him you like black.
- Yeah.

263
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,340
No past, no future. Just check
in to a hotel and start all over again.

264
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:04,153
I just stick them under the sheets...

265
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:07,656
That's strange, am I right?

266
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,130
- In another life, have a good time.
- Thanks.

267
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,506
Who is that guy Shackleford?

268
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:34,278
Someone who works for me.

269
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,717
Someone I trust.

270
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:42,624
He killed someone once.

271
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:51,201
Tell me, where do you see
yourself in, say, ten years?

272
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:56,502
Well, I wouldn't mind being
a billionaire like yourself.

273
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,867
Nice shot. I mean beyond money.

274
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:02,571
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well?

275
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:06,180
Are you saying you're not satisfied?

276
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,510
Who is?

277
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,549
I am.

278
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:15,553
She mean it?

279
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:18,026
I hope so.

280
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:22,054
Well then, you may not have won
in Vegas, but you're a lucky man.

281
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:24,225
I got money, I got security,
I have businesses,

282
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:28,135
but you have something
that I just don't have.

283
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:31,208
I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

284
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,439
Not many.

285
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:37,074
Well, some things aren't for sale.

286
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,074
Such as?

287
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,419
Well, you can't buy people.

288
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:47,485
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

289
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,925
In business, maybe, but not
when real emotions are involved.

290
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:55,464
What are you saying?
You can't buy love? Isn't that a cliché?

291
00:34:56,768 --> 00:34:59,896
- It's absolutely true.
- Is it?

292
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,938
What do you think?

293
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:04,906
- I agree with Diana.
- You do?

294
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,540
Well, let's test the cliché.

295
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:18,054
Suppose I were to offer
you one million dollars...

296
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:24,989
...for one night with your wife?

297
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,261
I'd assume you're kidding.

298
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,633
Let's pretend I am not.
What would you say?

299
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:41,272
He'd tell you to go to hell.

300
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:45,415
I didn't hear him.

301
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:48,779
I'd tell you to go to hell.

302
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:04,198
That's a reflex answer
because your view it as hypothetical.

303
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:08,396
But let's say that
there were real money behind it.

304
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:11,375
I am not kidding.

305
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:17,038
A million dollars. The night would pass,
but the money could last a lifetime.

306
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:20,012
Think of it.

307
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:22,449
A million dollars.

308
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:28,355
A lifetime of security, for one night.

309
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:33,887
And don't answer right away,
but consider it.

310
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,830
Seriously.

311
00:36:38,136 --> 00:36:40,502
We're positive, OK?

312
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:46,072
Then you have answered my question.

313
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:50,375
And you have proved your point.
There are limits to what money can buy.

314
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:55,179
It's late and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

315
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,447
May I have one dance?

316
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:00,387
Of course, with your permission.

317
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,686
I think you'd better
get on to that meeting.

318
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:04,988
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

319
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:09,429
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her either.

320
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,865
Goodnight.

321
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:12,892
Can't sleep?

322
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:15,783
No.

323
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:20,167
Me neither.

324
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:29,444
I just keep thinking about it.

325
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:34,511
It's so weird, isn't it?

326
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:38,452
Yeah.

327
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:47,494
David, I think you want me to do it.

328
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:54,433
What are you talking about?

329
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,665
Don't be ridiculous.

330
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,108
Maybe we should just talk about it.

331
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,806
Well, I don't want you to do it.

332
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:12,320
- But you'd let me do it.
- No.

333
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:20,959
Why? Do you want to do it?

334
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:23,584
No.

335
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:31,341
But I would. I'd do it for you.

336
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,536
For me?

337
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:48,881
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

338
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:56,163
Think about what this money could do
for us, what it could do for our future.

339
00:39:57,635 --> 00:40:00,468
You could finish your house.

340
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:05,736
You could pay your dad back.
Get rid of our debts.

341
00:40:07,445 --> 00:40:10,005
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

342
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:12,309
It's just my body.

343
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:16,045
It's not my mind.
It's not my heart.

344
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:22,682
You think we could
do something like that?

345
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:32,466
We both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

346
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,002
Yeah.

347
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,497
So we just have to look at it like that.

348
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:45,942
I slept with Bubba Aruzio! If I can
do that, I can sleep with anyone.

349
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:49,451
- You slept with Bubba?
- You knew.

350
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:52,112
No, I didn't know that. When?

351
00:40:53,624 --> 00:40:56,787
When you were off sleeping
with that slut Olivia Daigle.

352
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:01,729
- Olivia Deagle. And she wasn't a slut.
- Excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

353
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:03,333
I do love you.

354
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,163
- She wasn't a slut.
- Yes, she was.

355
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,568
No, she wasn't...

356
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:10,936
...unfortunately!

357
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:17,473
Thank God we can laugh about it.

358
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:19,515
Yeah.

359
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:22,983
That's easy to say now. After...

360
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:31,560
We just have to forget
it ever happened.

361
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:36,891
And never discuss it. Not even once.

362
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:43,332
Because nothing will have happened.

363
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:48,076
Nothing that matters, anyway.

364
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,919
We have a brilliant script. Very special.

365
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:03,390
It's a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.

366
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,986
And Billy Ray Cyrus.
Kind of "A Star is Born"...

367
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:09,429
So your first screenplay
sold for half a million.

368
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:12,468
- Should have been two.
- Except our lawyer caved in on us.

369
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:16,130
- That won't happen again.
- We're going to get a lawyer that's tough.

370
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,005
Someone that will step on
his grandmother for us.

371
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:24,212
Mr. Green. A David Murphy
wants to speak to you urgently.

372
00:42:24,212 --> 00:42:26,009
Put him on the speaker.

373
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:28,914
This is an old college buddy.
It will only take a second.

374
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:32,250
<i>- Jeremy?</i>
<i>- Davey, I am in a meeting. What's up?</i>

375
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,620
<i>Listen, we need you to close a deal.</i>

376
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,250
<i>- What kind of deal?</i>
<i>- A very big deal.</i>

377
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,295
Big deal. Go on.

378
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:44,527
<i>We're in Vegas at the Hilton. We met</i>
<i>John Gage. You know who he is?</i>

379
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:50,107
Sure I know who he is. He's
a billionaire. And a major poon hound.

380
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:51,503
<i>He is?</i>

381
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:52,939
Go on.

382
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:56,774
<i>- He offered us a million dollars.</i>
<i>- A million dollars?</i>

383
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,747
For what? Your kidneys?

384
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:03,853
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

385
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:09,822
What do you mean? One night? Like...

386
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:11,258
<i>Yes.</i>

387
00:43:14,432 --> 00:43:17,924
Could you excuse me for a second?

388
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:25,037
Let me get this straight.

389
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:30,273
He offered you a million dollars for a
night with your wife? Your wife Diana?

390
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:35,317
And you agreed? I don't know
what to say. How could you do that?

391
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:40,186
How could you negotiate without me?
Never negotiate without your lawyer!

392
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:44,556
For a woman like Diana, I could have
gotten you at least two million!

393
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:48,961
Obviously! You don't want to
get screwed and then screwed!

394
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,863
Stay, please. This is damage control.

395
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:54,335
- Two seconds. Eat cookies.
- No. We have heard enough.

396
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:57,839
- You're hired.
- You're our man. We love your style.

397
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,342
Gladys, check the gentlemen's
schedules. Call me next week.

398
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:03,003
- Great.
- See you then.

399
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:06,913
- Thanks for coming.
- No. Thank you.

400
00:44:06,913 --> 00:44:09,679
OK, David, before we go any further,

401
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,916
let's get the moral issue out of the way.

402
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:18,188
Leave that to us. No, I was
referring to my fee. I get 5%.

403
00:44:19,897 --> 00:44:22,127
Would you elaborate
on the verification clause?

404
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,463
Verification. That means you pay, even
if the relationship isn't consummated.

405
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,036
You mean if I am impotent.

406
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,508
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

407
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:39,741
I can live with that.
The "John Garfield clause"?

408
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:42,978
That's if you die in the act.

409
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:49,886
I have no problem with that either.
Can I have your pen?

410
00:44:57,201 --> 00:44:59,965
- You're pretty good, you know?
- Thank you.

411
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,628
You should come work for me.

412
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:15,818
We have a deal.

413
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:24,260
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning.

414
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:31,968
So...

415
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:34,828
So...

416
00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:37,336
So...

417
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:41,768
You can go.

418
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:44,540
Gentlemen, I think it's time
for men of good will

419
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,345
to take leave of one another.

420
00:46:14,645 --> 00:46:16,772
It's all right.

421
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,973
I don't bite.

422
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:22,810
So...

423
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:26,889
What, should I go undress?

424
00:46:31,729 --> 00:46:34,926
Cheer up. Find a more creative way
to think about this, OK?

425
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:39,526
Just look at it like an episode of "The
Dating Game" that went a bit awry.

426
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:42,468
- It's going to be OK...
- Ladies and gentlemen.

427
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:46,872
Me wish to welcome you
to our jamboree.

428
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:51,607
I couldn't believe it. I know
we could have gotten two million.

429
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:53,114
Here's your Buddha.

430
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:56,048
Davey, no point getting out
the crying towel.

431
00:46:56,048 --> 00:46:59,953
You have got a million bucks, buddy.
A million bucks!

432
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,886
She's an amazing woman.
She really is.

433
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:09,932
Couldn't have gotten 500 for
my girlfriend. Not that I'd do that...

434
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:14,470
But it's OK that you did.
This is a different situation.

435
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,630
And she agreed to it,
you got to remember that.

436
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:21,677
And it's not like it's hard duty or
anything. Hell, he's a great-looking guy.

437
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:24,872
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

438
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:28,313
Maybe not.

439
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:30,784
Hey, buddy!

440
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,494
Come on!

441
00:47:52,643 --> 00:47:54,133
Come on!

442
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:59,811
What have I done?

443
00:48:13,798 --> 00:48:16,323
D, it's me!

444
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:18,268
D!

445
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:20,737
D!

446
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:27,472
Where is she?
Where's my wife?

447
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:34,137
Diana!

448
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:37,418
Please!

449
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,352
Where did they go?

450
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:42,459
- Up!
- Up where?

451
00:48:42,993 --> 00:48:45,359
<i>- Helicóptero.</i>
<i>- Helicopter.</i>

452
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:03,313
D!

453
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:09,119
D!

454
00:49:11,355 --> 00:49:12,605
D! D!

455
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,930
D!

456
00:53:38,188 --> 00:53:42,625
They sent for me.
They said you were ready.

457
00:53:55,906 --> 00:53:57,396
Come here.

458
00:54:20,063 --> 00:54:22,031
You missed a button.

459
00:54:29,606 --> 00:54:31,767
Thank you.

460
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,143
I want to show you something.

461
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:55,325
- What happened?
- Lights went off.

462
00:54:58,368 --> 00:55:00,768
I see that. Why?

463
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,204
Look.

464
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,244
Can you turn those off, too?

465
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:19,315
I am working on it.

466
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:26,586
Who made the decision?

467
00:55:30,234 --> 00:55:33,533
- We both did.
- No.

468
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:38,274
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

469
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:43,276
- You don't know him.
- I know he didn't stop you.

470
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:45,506
And if you were mine...

471
00:55:48,952 --> 00:55:51,580
...I wouldn't share you with anyone.

472
00:55:57,261 --> 00:56:00,230
You have no right to judge David.

473
00:56:02,866 --> 00:56:05,357
You're the one who has to buy women.

474
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:08,369
You think I have to buy women?

475
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:14,409
Why me, then?

476
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:18,139
I bought you because
you said you couldn't be bought.

477
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:21,881
I can't be bought.

478
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:24,351
We're just going to fuck,
as I understand it.

479
00:56:26,323 --> 00:56:28,154
You might enjoy it.

480
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,491
Don't bet on it.

481
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:36,530
I think I will.

482
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:45,463
Heads we do.
Tails we call the whole thing off.

483
00:56:45,463 --> 00:56:48,510
Turn the boat around, go home.
No hard feelings.

484
00:56:49,346 --> 00:56:51,610
What do you say?

485
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,710
It's your party.

486
00:56:56,887 --> 00:57:01,620
It's my lucky dollar, so I can't lose.

487
00:57:23,747 --> 00:57:25,044
Trust me.

488
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:29,478
Nothing's going to happen
you don't choose.

489
00:59:43,887 --> 00:59:46,412
- I love you.
- I love you.

490
01:00:02,038 --> 01:00:04,131
<i>I told myself it was over,</i>

491
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:06,970
<i>like a dream that vanishes</i>
<i>in the morning light,</i>

492
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,410
<i>and in time, enough time,</i>
<i>I would forget.</i>

493
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:27,487
Yeah.

494
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:30,622
All right.

495
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:38,463
Yeah. A little fixer-upper
south of Wilshire. It's nothing.

496
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:40,371
Yeah.

497
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:42,671
Look, I have got people here.

498
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:44,939
I will talk to you later.

499
01:00:44,939 --> 01:00:48,175
Sorry. I am here for you now.

500
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:50,912
All right. Two acres on Alta Loma...

501
01:00:50,912 --> 01:00:54,615
- Alta Vista.
- That's right. Murphy property.

502
01:00:55,525 --> 01:00:58,790
We have been a little late on
the payments. We want to settle up.

503
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,194
I don't think that's possible.

504
01:01:02,194 --> 01:01:05,199
- What do you mean?
- The mortgage is two months in default...

505
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:09,897
...and it appears that the property
is in contract to another party.

506
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:14,473
- To another party? Who?
- That's privileged information.

507
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:17,409
How can that be? We called
specifically for an extension.

508
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:20,141
The extension expired two days ago.

509
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:23,343
If you don't make a payment,
the bank can repossess.

510
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:27,013
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

511
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:29,352
They don't have to give us a warning.

512
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,552
But, in fact, an attempt was
made to call you on the 3rd.

513
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:36,427
A registered letter, return receipt
requested, was attempted on the 4th.

514
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:40,297
- Apparently there was no one home.
- We were out of town.

515
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:45,704
Well, I am sorry,
but you snooze, you lose.

516
01:01:46,977 --> 01:01:49,605
"You snooze, you lose."

517
01:01:50,313 --> 01:01:51,905
"You snooze, you lose"?

518
01:01:51,905 --> 01:01:56,144
- It's an expression.
- That's beautiful.

519
01:01:56,686 --> 01:01:59,154
That's bullshit!

520
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,814
This is bullshit, man!

521
01:02:01,814 --> 01:02:06,657
Don't deal with these people! They
sold us out. They will sell you out, too.

522
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:54,406
want to help me in the garden?

523
01:02:56,846 --> 01:02:57,596
OK.

524
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,119
Our tomatoes are looking good,
don't you think?

525
01:03:13,096 --> 01:03:14,757
David?

526
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:19,467
What's "Gryphonne"?

527
01:03:20,904 --> 01:03:22,895
Gryphon.

528
01:03:24,174 --> 01:03:26,301
Where did you hear that name?

529
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:30,477
You have a box of matches.

530
01:03:32,415 --> 01:03:37,114
- We said we wouldn't talk about it.
- Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

531
01:03:39,122 --> 01:03:41,454
Don't you?

532
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:42,534
- No.
- D.

533
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:50,458
I thought I could forget
about this, but I can't.

534
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:56,732
So I think maybe if we just talk about it,
we can put it behind us.

535
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,347
"Gryphon" is a boat.

536
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:08,883
He took you to a boat?

537
01:04:08,883 --> 01:04:12,146
- In Nevada?
- We flew to Santa Barbara.

538
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:14,722
- What kind of boat?
- A big boat.

539
01:04:14,722 --> 01:04:18,658
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

540
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,095
Where did you get the matches?
Were you going through my bag?

541
01:04:24,095 --> 01:04:24,845
No!

542
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:30,533
Why? What's in your bag?

543
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:34,399
I am not going to talk about this.
I am not going to do it.

544
01:06:11,774 --> 01:06:13,207
What?

545
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:18,907
- Who were you talking to?
- My mother.

546
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:22,313
And what did Mom have to say?

547
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:26,355
Nothing. She wasn't there.

548
01:06:26,355 --> 01:06:30,687
You said you were just talking to her.
How could you be if she wasn't there?

549
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:34,957
Well, I was trying to talk to her,
but I didn't reach her.

550
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,794
- She wasn't in after ten o'clock?
- No, she's not.

551
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:42,030
If you don't believe me,
would you like to talk to her yourself?

552
01:06:44,707 --> 01:06:47,005
What is the matter with you?

553
01:06:53,216 --> 01:06:56,549
- What is that?
- You know what it is.

554
01:06:59,923 --> 01:07:03,222
- Where did you get this?
- In your wallet.

555
01:07:03,222 --> 01:07:04,758
I have never seen it.

556
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:08,625
It was in the secret compartment.
Have you been seeing him?

557
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:11,256
- No!
- You can't stop thinking about him.

558
01:07:11,256 --> 01:07:12,891
You won't let me.

559
01:07:14,137 --> 01:07:16,697
- Why did you look in my wallet?
- I don't trust you.

560
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:20,366
- You know, I don't trust you either.
- Well, then we're even.

561
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:31,616
<i>I had to do something.</i>

562
01:07:31,616 --> 01:07:34,518
<i>I wanted to make something good</i>
<i>out of all we'd done wrong.</i>

563
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:38,559
<i>I decided to try and buy</i>
<i>our land back.</i>

564
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,289
OK. Alta Vista.

565
01:07:41,289 --> 01:07:45,561
I just need to find out the guy's name.
I want to make him an offer.

566
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:50,105
- I will get killed for this, Diana.
- I don't want you to get in trouble.

567
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:52,833
- 543 Alta Vista.
- There it is.

568
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,944
There it is right there. Back up.

569
01:07:54,944 --> 01:07:58,343
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

570
01:08:00,216 --> 01:08:03,811
This guy's never going to sell, Diana.

571
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:06,547
I just saw this guy on TV!

572
01:08:46,929 --> 01:08:50,160
You bastard! You stole our property.

573
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:55,228
- I'd like to introduce a friend of mine...
- I am not your friend.

574
01:08:55,228 --> 01:08:57,999
- Diana advised me on some property...
- Bullshit!

575
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:01,770
- You took it and I want it back.
- I tell you what. Can we have...

576
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:05,039
That's OK. No, everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

577
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:09,351
Excuse me.

578
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:18,184
I am taking it off!

579
01:09:21,297 --> 01:09:23,993
- Wait a minute...
- Why? Did you just want to hurt me?

580
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,261
- No! I think you're wonderful.
- That was our house! How could you?

581
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:30,531
- I got there first.
- I want you to sell it back to me.

582
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:33,540
- You can't afford it.
- How's a million dollars?

583
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,373
- The price is two.
- If I had two, the price would be four.

584
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,640
Listen.
I saw an opportunity and took it.

585
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,878
You had the money and the right
instincts, but you were too late.

586
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:46,545
- I want you to work for me.
- Go to hell.

587
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:48,987
- Listen, I mean it.
- Never.

588
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:50,956
Why not?

589
01:09:50,956 --> 01:09:53,654
- Because I hate you.
- No, you don't.

590
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:57,491
You wish you hated me.

591
01:10:17,687 --> 01:10:19,382
Hi, D.

592
01:10:23,526 --> 01:10:25,494
You look awful.

593
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:30,192
- Where have you been?
- I will tell you about it.

594
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,530
I am just going to have some wine first.

595
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:37,630
Do you want some?

596
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,388
So where have you been?

597
01:11:07,904 --> 01:11:11,897
Last night I stayed up for hours,
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

598
01:11:14,944 --> 01:11:17,174
And today?

599
01:11:20,082 --> 01:11:21,845
And today I saw Gage.

600
01:11:29,892 --> 01:11:33,919
Thank you for your trust, David.
And for listening.

601
01:11:34,564 --> 01:11:36,498
- Did you fuck him?
- No!

602
01:11:36,498 --> 01:11:40,659
- But you wanted to, right?
- I met him in broad daylight, in public.

603
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:45,001
- I don't believe you.
- David, he bought our property.

604
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:50,204
That's why I went to see him. I just
wanted to find some way to get it back.

605
01:11:50,204 --> 01:11:55,113
You have no reason to be jealous.
I hate him.

606
01:11:55,113 --> 01:11:57,481
- Tell me what happened on that boat.
- Don't do this!

607
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,554
Tell me what happened!

608
01:11:59,554 --> 01:12:02,283
- Why?
- because I want to know.

609
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:05,826
All right, I will tell you.
The man was a fucking stallion.

610
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:08,829
Is that what you want me to say?
We did it all night.

611
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:11,798
- Is that the truth?
- You don't want the truth.

612
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:16,701
You want me to lie and say he's awful.
So I will say it, and you won't believe me.

613
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:19,364
Just tell me the truth, D.

614
01:12:19,364 --> 01:12:23,069
It was sex, David.
Just sex. Not love, just sex.

615
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,375
- Was it good sex?
- Don't do this, David.

616
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:29,450
Can you just tell me that, D?
Why are you hesitating?

617
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,884
Just tell me. Was it good?

618
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:35,188
Yes.

619
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:46,822
David.

620
01:12:50,406 --> 01:12:56,311
D, don't tell me it was just sex.
You were attracted to him all along.

621
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:59,744
That's bullshit.
David, I did it for you.

622
01:12:59,744 --> 01:13:04,842
Don't tell me you did it for me. You did it
for yourself. You were dying to do it.

623
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:08,479
It's a lie. I would never do this
for myself. It was all for you.

624
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,185
Don't lie to me!
You were attracted to him!

625
01:14:13,155 --> 01:14:15,749
I knew something like this
was going to happen.

626
01:14:15,749 --> 01:14:21,158
I guess you make a deal with the devil,
and eventually you pay the price.

627
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:25,131
Thanks. From the man
who closed the deal with the devil,

628
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:27,827
that's very comforting.

629
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:31,193
Green.

630
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:35,270
- Hi, Di.
- I am not here.

631
01:14:36,278 --> 01:14:39,270
Yeah, he's right here.
You want to speak to him?

632
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:43,112
<i>- No, I don't want to talk to him.</i>
<i>- Look, sweetie.</i>

633
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:46,653
He loves you. You love him.

634
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:50,156
You got to try and work this out.
It's pretty simple.

635
01:14:50,156 --> 01:14:54,786
<i>- This is a deal even I can't screw up.</i>
<i>- Tell him he can keep the money.</i>

636
01:14:56,565 --> 01:14:58,931
I don't want any of it.

637
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:10,670
Davey? She says she
doesn't want the money.

638
01:15:11,747 --> 01:15:13,681
I don't want the money either.

639
01:15:23,392 --> 01:15:27,590
I will take it.
I mean, if nobody else wants it.

640
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:52,814
- Hi.
- Hi, Diana.

641
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:10,963
<i>The next few weeks without David</i>
<i>felt like months.</i>

642
01:16:10,963 --> 01:16:14,098
<i>I got very good at staring at walls.</i>

643
01:16:14,098 --> 01:16:18,077
Diana, Diana.

644
01:16:18,077 --> 01:16:19,704
The recession has ended.

645
01:16:19,704 --> 01:16:23,945
There's a fella out there
wants to see $10 million homes.

646
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:26,384
There is a god.

647
01:16:30,092 --> 01:16:31,457
Find someone else.

648
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:37,724
Are you nuts? Do you know what
the commission is on $10 million?

649
01:16:37,724 --> 01:16:40,028
- I can't do it.
- You have to do it.

650
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,364
You're the best one I have.

651
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:46,407
You're the only one I have.
The others are all on caravan.

652
01:16:52,114 --> 01:16:54,844
I am sorry, Mr. Langford. I can't.

653
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:59,921
I would never dream of forcing you
to do anything against your will.

654
01:17:00,956 --> 01:17:02,981
Except this one time.

655
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,723
Now move your ass or you're fired.

656
01:17:13,569 --> 01:17:17,300
If you think this is going to work,
you underestimate me.

657
01:17:42,431 --> 01:17:45,059
You are truly beautiful.

658
01:17:46,435 --> 01:17:48,767
What do you think you're doing?

659
01:17:50,773 --> 01:17:53,037
Looking for a house.

660
01:17:57,179 --> 01:18:00,410
There's Bel Air, Benedict Canyon,
Pacific Palisades.

661
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:03,712
- Where would you like to go first?
- Paris.

662
01:18:05,621 --> 01:18:08,488
1120 Bel Air Road, please.

663
01:18:17,466 --> 01:18:21,800
The ceilings are French Gothic.
Renaissance paintings, as you can see.

664
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,928
Parquet floors throughout.

665
01:18:23,928 --> 01:18:25,870
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

666
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:29,238
This is the master bath.

667
01:18:33,082 --> 01:18:35,277
Why didn't you return my calls?

668
01:18:36,285 --> 01:18:37,843
Do you like it?

669
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:40,617
No.

670
01:18:53,035 --> 01:18:54,935
- 30 million minimum.
- You think?

671
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,129
- I know.
- Let's look at it.

672
01:18:57,129 --> 01:19:00,935
- It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

673
01:19:31,674 --> 01:19:34,234
This is your house, isn't it?

674
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:37,738
Do you like it?

675
01:19:43,085 --> 01:19:46,486
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

676
01:19:47,356 --> 01:19:49,551
What do you think it needs?

677
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,751
Tell me. Honestly.

678
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:57,288
I think it needs a life.

679
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:03,567
I think it needs furniture and
maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.

680
01:20:03,567 --> 01:20:05,697
It needs you.

681
01:20:08,944 --> 01:20:12,345
Just forget it. This just won't work.

682
01:20:12,345 --> 01:20:14,108
Why not?

683
01:20:15,584 --> 01:20:18,917
Because from where we have started
we have got nowhere to go.

684
01:20:18,917 --> 01:20:21,045
You don't know that.

685
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:24,616
I have never started this way either.

686
01:20:27,996 --> 01:20:30,294
I need you.

687
01:20:33,769 --> 01:20:34,519
No.

688
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:37,966
You collect things.

689
01:20:40,943 --> 01:20:42,877
Don't you?

690
01:20:44,213 --> 01:20:46,147
Sometimes.

691
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,170
Yeah.

692
01:21:58,554 --> 01:22:04,117
Even if you were extremely rich
and smart can you be president?

693
01:22:04,117 --> 01:22:07,990
- No.
- You couldn't be president? Why not?

694
01:22:09,298 --> 01:22:13,667
<i>I took a second job teaching</i>
<i>citizenship, just to keep myself busy.</i>

695
01:22:15,304 --> 01:22:17,966
Ju, where were you born?

696
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:20,472
I was born in Seoul, Korea.

697
01:22:20,472 --> 01:22:26,741
- OK, where was she born?
- She was born in Seoul, Korea.

698
01:22:27,349 --> 01:22:31,183
<i>That drug dealer, he is the president.</i>

699
01:22:31,183 --> 01:22:33,914
<i>In my country he could be both.</i>

700
01:22:34,423 --> 01:22:37,256
Where were you born, Miguel?

701
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:41,123
- Sorry.
- Welcome back.

702
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:45,199
- Where were you born?
- Cuba.

703
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:49,098
So, how do we say "Cuba"
in America?

704
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:51,297
Cuba.

705
01:22:52,174 --> 01:22:55,109
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

706
01:22:55,109 --> 01:22:58,475
- Isn't this the citizenship class?
- Yes.

707
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:01,879
- Can I sit in?
- It's full.

708
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:14,190
- Cuba.
- Thank you.

709
01:23:29,912 --> 01:23:31,743
OK, um...

710
01:23:31,743 --> 01:23:33,643
I have a question for you.

711
01:23:34,283 --> 01:23:37,741
Excuse me. Is there something
you'd like to share with us?

712
01:23:38,287 --> 01:23:41,188
I was just saying
that you're an amazing woman.

713
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:48,320
And beautiful.

714
01:23:50,465 --> 01:23:52,990
And talented.

715
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,603
And I am crazy about her.

716
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,248
- You're full of surprises, aren't you?
- I am trying like hell.

717
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:12,816
- You should go.
- You want me to go?

718
01:24:12,816 --> 01:24:13,566
No!

719
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,929
Nice people. They want the Dream.

720
01:24:22,929 --> 01:24:26,125
Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

721
01:24:28,837 --> 01:24:31,738
You have chalk on your face.

722
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,769
I have something I want to show you.

723
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:54,419
I didn't know whether
you like big ones or little ones.

724
01:24:56,865 --> 01:25:00,357
You're so beautiful. Come here.

725
01:25:03,005 --> 01:25:06,839
I didn't have much time
to do anything else.

726
01:25:08,643 --> 01:25:11,510
But it's a start.

727
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:25,513
Dance?

728
01:25:29,097 --> 01:25:31,258
I should go.

729
01:25:36,038 --> 01:25:37,835
I remember once when I was young,

730
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:40,771
and I was coming back from
a movie or something,

731
01:25:40,771 --> 01:25:42,934
I was on the subway.

732
01:25:45,147 --> 01:25:48,378
There was a girl sitting across from me.

733
01:25:48,378 --> 01:25:54,478
She was wearing this dress that
was buttoned clear up right to here.

734
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,188
She was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

735
01:26:03,799 --> 01:26:06,097
And I was shy then.

736
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:09,465
So when she would look at me,

737
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:11,595
I would look away.

738
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:16,076
Then, afterwards,
when I would look back,

739
01:26:16,076 --> 01:26:18,406
she would look away.

740
01:26:19,915 --> 01:26:26,081
Then I got to where I was going to get
off, and got off. The doors closed.

741
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:33,552
And as the train was pulling away,
she looked right at me

742
01:26:33,552 --> 01:26:36,391
and gave me the most incredible smile.

743
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:43,597
It was awful.
I wanted to tear the doors open.

744
01:26:43,597 --> 01:26:48,675
I went back every night,
same time, for two weeks.

745
01:26:51,746 --> 01:26:54,442
But she never showed up.

746
01:26:56,284 --> 01:26:58,548
That was 30 years ago.

747
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:04,521
And I don't think there's a day
that goes by that I don't think about her.

748
01:27:06,528 --> 01:27:09,656
I don't want that to happen again.

749
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:17,732
Just one dance?

750
01:30:49,117 --> 01:30:51,449
You wanted the driver's side...

751
01:30:52,387 --> 01:30:54,617
I want a word with you, Gage.

752
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:58,658
What you don't know is
we got a secret, me and Diana.

753
01:30:58,658 --> 01:31:00,192
We're invincible.

754
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:05,359
- Diana, I need to talk...
- Tomorrow might be a better time.

755
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,730
Tomorrow might be better, you think?

756
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,894
Johnny-baby,
I got a suggestion for you.

757
01:31:09,894 --> 01:31:15,101
You know that emblem you got?
The gryphon? The eagle?

758
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:19,304
I don't think it's a good idea.
I got a better idea.

759
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:24,578
How about the cuckoo? Because...
I am talking to you for a second.

760
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:27,882
The cuckoo is interesting.
It doesn't have its own nest,

761
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:31,788
so it moves into the nest of other birds
and destroys their eggs.

762
01:31:31,788 --> 01:31:33,450
David, stop.

763
01:31:36,798 --> 01:31:38,959
You don't love me anymore?

764
01:31:44,172 --> 01:31:47,266
Have I ever told you I love you?

765
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,004
Have a nice dinner.

766
01:31:55,817 --> 01:31:57,842
- Help him.
- Here.

767
01:31:59,354 --> 01:32:00,981
Go inside.

768
01:32:00,981 --> 01:32:03,920
You got him?

769
01:32:05,927 --> 01:32:06,427
D.

770
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:38,001
You have done a lot since USC.

771
01:34:38,001 --> 01:34:42,173
First in your class. AIA award.

772
01:34:42,173 --> 01:34:45,775
- Prix de Rome.
- Yeah.

773
01:34:47,221 --> 01:34:50,054
Why would you want this job?

774
01:34:50,054 --> 01:34:53,251
Well, I want to work.

775
01:34:56,898 --> 01:34:58,695
Overqualified.

776
01:34:59,267 --> 01:35:01,758
Fine. Exploit me.

777
01:35:37,805 --> 01:35:40,501
Great architecture
only comes from your passion,

778
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:42,906
and even that won't assure you a job.

779
01:35:42,906 --> 01:35:45,604
Louis Kahn.

780
01:35:45,604 --> 01:35:49,911
Died in a men's room in Penn Station.
For days, no one claimed the body.

781
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,848
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

782
01:35:51,848 --> 01:35:54,181
The money men did not weep,

783
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:57,052
because the great ones
are impossible to deal with.

784
01:35:57,052 --> 01:36:02,288
They're a pain in the ass, because they
know that if they do their jobs properly,

785
01:36:02,288 --> 01:36:04,796
if they just this once get it right,

786
01:36:04,796 --> 01:36:09,460
they can actually lift the human spirit,
take it to a higher place.

787
01:36:14,876 --> 01:36:17,436
- What is this?
- A brick.

788
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:21,278
Good. What else?

789
01:36:21,278 --> 01:36:23,350
A weapon.

790
01:36:26,587 --> 01:36:30,956
Louis Kahn said, "Even a brick
wants to be something."

791
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:41,825
A brick wants to be something.

792
01:36:44,072 --> 01:36:46,040
It aspires.

793
01:36:52,313 --> 01:36:57,649
Even a common, ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is.

794
01:37:02,857 --> 01:37:06,691
Wants to be something better than it is.

795
01:37:14,535 --> 01:37:16,662
That is what we must be.

796
01:37:20,508 --> 01:37:22,840
See you on Friday.

797
01:37:33,888 --> 01:37:37,619
A brick wants to be something?
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

798
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:40,193
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

799
01:37:40,828 --> 01:37:43,991
- I missed you, too.
- Thanks.

800
01:37:48,903 --> 01:37:51,428
- How you doing?
- I am good.

801
01:37:51,428 --> 01:37:53,597
I am getting it together.

802
01:37:59,046 --> 01:38:01,037
She wants a divorce.

803
01:38:04,018 --> 01:38:06,282
She wants her freedom.

804
01:38:07,822 --> 01:38:11,519
If you don't contest it,
you get everything.

805
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:15,095
The land, the money. Everything.

806
01:38:16,097 --> 01:38:17,962
Where is she?

807
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:30,007
Hi, everybody. I am Billy Connolly.
Goodbye, everybody.

808
01:38:30,007 --> 01:38:33,910
You may wonder what you're doing
here, sitting in the blazing sun,

809
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:37,677
as the smell of the zoo
wafts past your nostrils.

810
01:38:37,677 --> 01:38:41,550
The reason you are here
is because you are loaded.

811
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:44,283
May I say how brilliant it is
to see so many people

812
01:38:44,283 --> 01:38:47,622
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species.

813
01:38:47,622 --> 01:38:51,129
Every year, we have this unique way
of making money for the cause.

814
01:38:51,129 --> 01:38:54,826
We auction animals.
We bid as high as we possibly can,

815
01:38:54,826 --> 01:38:57,529
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts.

816
01:38:57,529 --> 01:39:02,075
Let's start the show with a bang. We have
got a superstar as our first animal.

817
01:39:02,075 --> 01:39:05,509
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

818
01:39:05,509 --> 01:39:09,412
The animal itself
is far too big and angry to bring along.

819
01:39:09,412 --> 01:39:13,145
Look at this guy.
Thousands and thousands of pounds

820
01:39:13,145 --> 01:39:16,222
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

821
01:39:16,222 --> 01:39:19,292
Weighs slightly less
than the average school bus.

822
01:39:19,292 --> 01:39:22,089
And look at that magnificent beastie.

823
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:27,258
To put him in a better light,
to relieve you of some serious money...

824
01:39:27,258 --> 01:39:29,596
Thank you very much.

825
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:32,137
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

826
01:39:33,274 --> 01:39:35,401
Isn't that nice?

827
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:43,049
Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't dream
of starting the bid below $10,000.

828
01:39:43,049 --> 01:39:45,516
- Now, I know it's a lot of money...
- 30.

829
01:39:45,516 --> 01:39:49,453
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen!

830
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:55,254
Call me a sentimental old fool,
do I hear 35?

831
01:39:55,254 --> 01:39:58,263
- 35.
- $35,000!

832
01:39:58,263 --> 01:40:00,924
- 40.
- $40,000!

833
01:40:00,924 --> 01:40:01,764
45,000.

834
01:40:03,437 --> 01:40:06,804
- 50.
- $50,000.

835
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:12,073
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.
50,000 once,

836
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:15,478
50,000 twice, ladies and gentlemen...

837
01:40:15,478 --> 01:40:18,312
One million dollars.

838
01:40:24,292 --> 01:40:25,691
I am sorry?

839
01:40:25,691 --> 01:40:28,090
One million dollars.

840
01:40:30,598 --> 01:40:33,328
Did you say one million dollars, sir?

841
01:40:33,328 --> 01:40:35,059
Yeah.

842
01:40:35,059 --> 01:40:38,763
Ladies and gentlemen,
one million dollars.

843
01:40:40,174 --> 01:40:43,905
Would anybody care to top that,
ladies and gentlemen?

844
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:45,307
I didn't think so.

845
01:40:45,307 --> 01:40:48,813
In that case, sir, I believe you're
the proud owner of a hippo.

846
01:40:48,813 --> 01:40:50,542
Congratulations.

847
01:41:04,532 --> 01:41:07,160
Hello, Diana.

848
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,098
The next animal to take the stand
is an ostrich...

849
01:41:09,098 --> 01:41:11,363
I really wanted you to have that money.

850
01:41:11,363 --> 01:41:13,973
I really wanted you to have that hippo.

851
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:21,210
Maybe you two would like
a moment alone.

852
01:41:34,895 --> 01:41:36,658
So...

853
01:41:39,633 --> 01:41:41,396
- How are you...
- I hear you're teaching...

854
01:41:41,396 --> 01:41:44,333
- Sorry.
- Go ahead.

855
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:46,838
Yeah. I am teaching.

856
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:54,045
You know, it doesn't pay much, but
at least I get to talk about architecture.

857
01:41:54,045 --> 01:41:57,582
You know how I love
to talk about architecture.

858
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:02,756
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a shower.

859
01:42:02,756 --> 01:42:06,189
A cheque book
makes an ideal umbrella.

860
01:42:06,189 --> 01:42:09,455
Do we have a dolphin?
Have we a dolphin and an octopus?

861
01:42:09,455 --> 01:42:11,656
How about tropical fish?

862
01:42:11,656 --> 01:42:14,734
I know. You're running home
for more cash.

863
01:42:14,734 --> 01:42:18,430
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
You can find the money.

864
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:21,040
To hell. I am gone.

865
01:42:30,351 --> 01:42:32,649
I have to talk to you
about what happened.

866
01:42:32,649 --> 01:42:35,415
- Don't.
- No. I have to.

867
01:42:35,415 --> 01:42:38,354
Just hear me out.

868
01:42:40,594 --> 01:42:43,825
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

869
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:48,162
was thinking that I could
forget what we did.

870
01:42:49,503 --> 01:42:52,631
I thought we were invincible.

871
01:42:53,741 --> 01:42:59,680
Now I know that the things that people
in love do to each other, they remember.

872
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,147
And if they stay together,
it's not because they forget,

873
01:43:03,147 --> 01:43:05,218
it's because they forgive.

874
01:43:12,193 --> 01:43:14,184
I was just...

875
01:43:17,131 --> 01:43:20,532
I was just so afraid
that you wanted him.

876
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:24,732
No, actually, I was afraid
you were right to want him.

877
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:33,446
I thought he was the better man.

878
01:43:38,519 --> 01:43:43,752
And I know now he's not.
He's just got more money.

879
01:45:16,383 --> 01:45:18,248
I think we should talk.

880
01:45:19,153 --> 01:45:21,144
I am very happy.

881
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:26,390
Shackleford,
have you ever seen me like this?

882
01:45:27,728 --> 01:45:30,060
Can't say that I have.

883
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:34,190
- Diana's the reason.
- Enough for any man.

884
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:38,396
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

885
01:45:39,607 --> 01:45:41,404
You are the best of them.

886
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:44,969
"The best of them"?

887
01:45:44,969 --> 01:45:47,637
You said I am the best of them?

888
01:45:47,637 --> 01:45:49,715
You are.

889
01:45:52,353 --> 01:45:54,082
I don't understand.

890
01:45:55,723 --> 01:45:58,715
Shackleford,
could you explain it to her?

891
01:45:58,715 --> 01:46:00,326
What?

892
01:46:01,695 --> 01:46:04,493
I could do that, sir.

893
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:08,193
But I feel Mrs. Murphy
would rather hear it from you.

894
01:46:08,193 --> 01:46:11,099
OK. All right.

895
01:46:11,099 --> 01:46:15,004
She's the best of
the million-dollar club. Obviously.

896
01:46:18,445 --> 01:46:21,903
- "Million-dollar club"?
- Now you have got it.

897
01:46:23,817 --> 01:46:25,409
You told me you'd
never done that before.

898
01:46:25,409 --> 01:46:28,112
How many members
would you say there are?

899
01:46:28,989 --> 01:46:31,048
- Members?
- Yeah.

900
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:35,153
- Worldwide?
- Yeah.

901
01:46:36,997 --> 01:46:38,555
I think a couple of dozen.

902
01:46:40,067 --> 01:46:42,661
Remember the one
that wouldn't stop hiccuping?

903
01:46:42,661 --> 01:46:45,795
- What?
- The waitress from Oklahoma.

904
01:46:45,795 --> 01:46:49,431
Every time you came near her,
she would convulse in hiccups.

905
01:46:51,512 --> 01:46:55,471
Yeah. I had forgotten. Quite a night.

906
01:46:57,551 --> 01:47:03,046
The best thing of it is that
you know if you're sexually compatible

907
01:47:03,046 --> 01:47:05,454
right from the start.

908
01:47:16,003 --> 01:47:18,563
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

909
01:47:48,168 --> 01:47:50,136
Thank you, John.

910
01:47:54,174 --> 01:47:55,436
Goodbye.

911
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:58,737
Goodbye.

912
01:48:05,252 --> 01:48:07,015
Here.

913
01:48:10,924 --> 01:48:12,391
For luck.

914
01:48:21,068 --> 01:48:23,059
- Take care of him.
- Sure.

915
01:48:32,045 --> 01:48:34,411
What was all that about?

916
01:48:36,283 --> 01:48:38,717
I wanted to end it.

917
01:48:42,623 --> 01:48:46,184
She never would have looked
at me the way she did at him.

918
01:49:37,311 --> 01:49:41,372
<i>Seven years ago, David proposed</i>
<i>to me at Paradise Cove.</i>

919
01:49:42,716 --> 01:49:47,517
<i>I wanted to go there to remember</i>

920
01:50:53,654 --> 01:50:56,817
Have I ever told you I love you?

921
01:51:06,266 --> 01:51:07,016
No.

922
01:51:12,105 --> 01:51:14,130
I do.

923
01:51:19,379 --> 01:51:21,040
Still?

924
01:51:25,185 --> 01:51:27,050
Always.

925
01:52:15,903 --> 01:52:24,244
