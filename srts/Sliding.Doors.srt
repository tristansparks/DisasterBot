00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:35,860
Hello, Helen... I' d almost
forgotten you work here

2
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,010
I know, I know, you'd almost
forgotten I work here...

3
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:44,247
but I swear I was up all night toying
with ideas for the fashion show...

4
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:46,036
...and I've really hit
on something. You see...

5
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:49,846
What?

6
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:57,403
I took four bottles of vodka on Friday,
it was my birthday, you know that

7
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:00,368
I was having a party and I was
running late, so I borrowed some

8
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,133
I bought some more to replace it

9
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,691
Not a lot of use to me when
I had nothing to offer the executives

10
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:06,258
who dropped by late Friday

11
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,941
Off the top of my head, you could
have told them you'd run out

12
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:12,151
It's, it's popular stuff

13
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:15,285
Bullshit, bullshit... We're in PR.
That's what we do, isn't it?

14
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,181
But you didn't do that,
did you, Paul?

15
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:21,914
No

16
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:24,981
So I'm out... am I?

17
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,547
Well, this is just perfect

18
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,418
Congratulations. You've wanted me
out for ages, now you've done it.

19
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:36,979
Very well done

20
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:42,874
For theft. Pretty foolproof

21
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,455
Okay, I'll go... I'll go

22
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:49,405
I was getting a bit choked up with all
the testosterone flying about the place

23
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,573
Best I get out before
I start growing a penis

24
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:56,316
Oh! Told you... lesbian

25
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:14,707
I really didn't think it'd be
so easy to crack, did you?

26
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:16,243
No
Oops

27
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:19,865
Thank you

28
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:29,989
District Line information.
Due to a derailment at Victoria...

29
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:32,453
...District Line trains are
subject to extensive delay

30
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,235
We suggest you find
alternative means of transport

31
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:08,390
Are you all right, love?
Oh, it's a bit of a nasty cut

32
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:10,784
Might need a couple of stitches...
Come on

33
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,556
Oh-oh... Ah, Beatles' lyrics, eh?

34
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:24,486
What?

35
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:27,584
'Elastic Thrombosis'.
They're guilty of lyric poaching

36
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,119
They're Beatles' lyrics,
aren't they?

37
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:30,785
I don't know, sorry

38
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:32,550
Of course you do. Come on,
everyone is born knowing all

39
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,762
the Beatles' lyrics instinctively

40
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:36,646
They're passed into the foetus subconsciously
along with all the amniotic stuff

41
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:40,094
In fact, they should be called
'The Foetles'

42
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:45,410
Not a fan, clearly

43
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,676
It's funny the way nobody
talks on the tubes, isn't it?

44
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:11,973
I mean, I rarely catch
the tube myself but, er... or lifts

45
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,111
Confined spaces,
everybody shuts down. Why is that?

46
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,629
Perhaps we think everyone else
in the tube or the lift

47
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,975
is a potential psychopath
or a drunk...

48
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,314
...so we close down and pretend
to... read a book or something

49
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,387
You've got a terrible tea stain
on your book

50
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:27,558
Look, I don't think you're a psychopath.
I just want to read my book

51
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:29,253
I, I understand. I apologise

52
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:34,114
I'm in a little bit of a good mood
today as a matter of fact so I'll just

53
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,300
...sorry

54
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,785
Have we met before?

55
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:42,277
No, no, honestly, honestly,
I'm, you... you seem familiar

56
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:43,809
I don't think so

57
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:46,633
Yes... Yes, you were
in the lift just now

58
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,579
You dropped your earring,
I picked it up

59
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,721
Oh yes, you did... Thank you

60
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,098
Pleasure

61
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,047
Do you work there?

62
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,605
I did do but I've just
been fired. Okay?

63
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,837
Oh no, that's... that's horrible,
I'm sorry

64
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,822
It's okay, you didn't do it

65
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,944
I thank you for your concern and glad
you're in a good mood, et cetera

66
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:11,178
I thank you for picking up my earring
but... I just want to read my book

67
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:26,702
Well, I get off at this stop.
I'm only telling you in case

68
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,878
you get off at this stop, too...

69
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,260
...and you get up before me
and then I get up and you think

70
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,221
I'm following you which I'm not

71
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,907
I mean, I wouldn't. I mean...

72
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,564
...you know

73
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,319
I really didn't mean any offence.
Please forgive me

74
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:41,454
I'm really not a nutcase...
I apologise

75
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,862
Excuse me. Um, I'm sorry

76
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:54,702
I, I'm sure you're not a nutcase or a
psycho or anything, it's just that, um

77
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,927
...I'm not, I'm not that good at,
um... you know, um...

78
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:02,861
Constructing sentences?

79
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,975
Anyway...

80
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:05,639
I'm James

81
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:07,494
Helen

82
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,579
I never figured out
why we didn't make it, Gerry

83
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,036
You went back to America, remember?
I couldn't afford the bus fares

84
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,382
I came back though

85
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:28,492
Turn my back for three lousy years and you
callously ditch me for another woman

86
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,081
Mmm, I know, I suppose
I'm just naturally impetuous

87
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:36,173
I live with someone. A man.
I live with a man

88
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:37,354
Really?

89
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,097
Mmm! I have people consider soul mates
who don't confide in me this much

90
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:45,644
And what would he say if he knew you were
walking up from the tube in broad daylight

91
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,827
...with a complete stranger?
Mmm, big deal

92
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:55,306
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Helen... Sorry about your job, really

93
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,616
I suppose being a Gemini
can have its down sides

94
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,875
Hey, remember what
the Monty Python boys say?

95
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,724
What..."Always look
on the bright side of life"?

96
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,154
No..."Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition"

97
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,099
What?

98
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,888
I didn't think you liked Elton John

99
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,993
I, I do, I do sometimes

100
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,435
You really shouldn't just stop like that.
Set a woman back three days

101
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:34,359
doing a thing like that

102
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,421
Who is she?

103
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:41,143
She's Lydia

104
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,319
Well, I've had a dreadful day

105
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,440
I got sacked.
And so did you it would seem

106
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:02,934
Cup of tea?

107
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:04,818
That'd be nice

108
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,051
You bastard! You bastard!

109
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:11,415
You useless shagging bastard!

110
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,444
I come home and catch you up to
your nuts in Lady Shagging Godiva

111
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:30,041
I am working all hours to support you while
you are supposedly writing your first novel

112
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:34,519
How long?
Huh?

113
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,514
Do you love her?

114
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:41,588
No, don't tell me,
I'm not interested

115
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,899
I'm only asking because I need
to know exactly how big a mug I am

116
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,704
Look, er... Iook...

117
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,614
Hello?
Helen? Is that you?

118
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:04,471
No, it's your bit of stuff.
Wednesday... shag day, remember?

119
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,205
Have you just got up, you lazy git?

120
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:16,640
Er, no. Er... well I, er...

121
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,264
...I didn't sleep that well
last night and then, er...

122
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,966
you know when you left I kind
of... I went into a really, er...

123
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:27,678
...a really, really deep, deep,
er, deep, deep sleep

124
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,518
And, er... I think I might be, er, coming,
coming down with, er... anyway, er

125
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,853
...what are you doing home
at this time of...

126
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:38,976
Oh my God, what happened to you?

127
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:43,834
Well, it depends.
Which story do you want first?

128
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,084
What?

129
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:48,036
Well... I got mugged. And...

130
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,889
What are you doing?

131
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,993
I can't stand Elton John.
You know that

132
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:00,924
Well, anyway... listen, tell me...

133
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,589
...what happened?
What happened to your head?

134
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,818
Well, I got mugged
and sacked only not in that order

135
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,450
Although it wasn't an actual mugging,
it was only an attempted mugging

136
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:08,483
according to the policeman...

137
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,849
...because they didn't...

138
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
wait a sec, wait a sec.

139
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,014
Come here... Come here

140
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,689
Now sit down. Just sit here. Okay?

141
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:24,229
Now... now you're in shock, darling,
okay. You've had a bit of

142
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:25,698
a little bit of a shock. Okay?
Now just relax

143
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,889
Um... do you want a brandy?

144
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:32,795
It's four in the afternoon

145
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,365
Of course it is... sorry

146
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:36,963
Gerry!

147
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:39,395
Are you okay?

148
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:42,756
Me? I'm fine... Um, I'm fine.
I'm just... No, anyway, anyway

149
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,992
Tell, tell, tell me what happened

150
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,959
And I just couldn't help
thinking...

151
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:16,610
if I had just caught that bloody
train it would never have happened

152
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,622
I'd have been home ages ago

153
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:22,525
Oh, well, you don't want to go
wondering about things like that

154
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:25,501
You know, um,'if only this',
and 'what if that'. I mean...

155
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,749
It's done now

156
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:33,024
Come on

157
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,553
Follow

158
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:37,922
Splash

159
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,781
I'm going to take you out...

160
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,728
and get you alarmingly out of
your head on Grolsch and then...

161
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,314
Dry
Thank you

162
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:48,003
Um, and then follow, follow,
follow, follow, follow...

163
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,600
and then when you've sung all your
favourite Barbra Streisand songs

164
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:51,942
at the top of your voice...

165
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,213
and got us slung out of the pub...

166
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:56,963
Ah, here we are. Yeah, put this on

167
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,449
I'm going to let you have intimate
carnal knowledge of a Lamb Passanda

168
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:02,278
...which I know your diet
does not allow, with a...

169
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,615
...double Tarka Dahl
which you can then, er...

170
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:06,177
...puke up all over the, er...
pristine doorstep of Herr

171
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,264
and Frau Goebbels next door and...

172
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,826
I'll help you

173
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,899
Oh, I love you, Gerry

174
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,818
Gerry! She's not here!

175
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:18,632
Anna, you're Helen's best friend.
I mean, where else would she be?

176
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:20,640
Come in and search the place
if you want. She's not here, Gerry

177
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:25,932
What is it you've done anyway? It can't be
that nice if she's walked out on you

178
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:28,418
Okay, look, I, I'm sorry.
Look, if she comes here...

179
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:31,240
...just let me know or, or get her
to ring me or, or something

180
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,031
That's all I ask

181
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,236
Like you say, Gerry,
I'm Helen's best friend

182
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:37,346
If she comes here
I'll do what she asks

183
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:05,865
Well, she's got a point...
You can't stand Elton John

184
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:08,716
Russell, forget about Elton John.
That's not the issue. What do I do?

185
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:09,795
Gerry...

186
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,725
you've been telling me for weeks
you couldn't hack it juggling

187
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,065
between Helen and Lydia...

188
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,337
...and you wish you hadn't
got involved with her again

189
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:16,234
I know

190
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,473
And you didn't think you were
cut out for infidelity

191
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,370
I know

192
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:22,088
But you couldn't end it with Lydia,
'cause you weren't sure how she'd take it

193
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:26,823
And I told you that something
if you remember my words,

194
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,836
something 'ungoverned by you'
would happen...

195
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,114
...to bring the situation to a head

196
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:34,088
And... something has

197
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,123
It's not funny actually, Russell

198
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,655
No, I'm sorry, old man...
I beg to differ

199
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,475
It is funny.
It's very, very, very funny

200
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:50,155
And look at you, it's not as though
you're rushing frantically

201
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,751
about the place trying to find her

202
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:53,350
I went to Anna's. She wasn't there

203
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:57,198
Oh, you went to Anna's. Boy,
you're a one man SAS crack unit

204
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,516
You want my opinion?

205
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:03,109
Will I like it?

206
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:05,672
Well, of course not...
It'll be based on reality

207
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,592
No, no, no. You don't advertise
a new restaurant. It's very uncool

208
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,664
It's word of mouth... People talk

209
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,721
And how do these people who talk know where
you are so that they can talk about you?

210
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:26,543
Hey, listen, it's your restaurant,
Clive. I just want it to work

211
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,366
Helen

212
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:32,429
Hello, James. Rather annoying
chatty bloke on the tube

213
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:34,864
Oh yes, hi

214
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:37,969
You look all stressed up
with nowhere to go

215
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,488
It's only a job,
you'll get another one

216
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:42,767
No, it's something else, isn't it?

217
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,801
You know sometimes it helps
to just say whatever it is out loud

218
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,943
Of course it also helps if people
just mind their own business

219
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:50,448
and leave you alone. I'm sorry

220
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:53,647
When I left you at the tube earlier,
I went home and found my boyfriend...

221
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:54,990
...in bed with another woman. Shit!

222
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,795
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's... I mean, what an idiot

223
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,189
It's okay, you weren't to know

224
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,147
No, not me, your boyfriend.
He's an idiot

225
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:08,334
Sorry, it's not my place

226
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:10,513
It's okay

227
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:14,166
Well, look, if it makes you feel any better,
you see that bloke over there?

228
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,458
Not only does he own a personalised
matching set of crocodile skin luggage...

229
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:19,629
...but his favourite TV programme
is'Baywatch'

230
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:22,545
So you see there's always someone
sadder than you

231
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,573
Do you love him?

232
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:30,315
No, I could never
love a 'Baywatch' fan

233
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:35,378
Hey, you did a joke in the midst
of your turbulent emotional state

234
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:37,332
That's very positive

235
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,825
Listen, you decide you want
company we're over here... Okay?

236
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:43,598
I'm really sorry, Helen

237
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:59,789
Two of your most disgustingly
large Grolsches, please...

238
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:03,059
...and a large Jack Daniels
with ice, and I'll have the same

239
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:10,163
You're behind. Can we have another?

240
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:15,124
Fifteen?

241
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:43,224
Gerry came looking for you

242
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,531
Is it what I think?

243
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:46,958
Depends

244
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:51,321
Is what you think that I walked in on him
shagging 'Lydia' in my bed and I walked out?

245
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,523
Pretty much

246
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,541
Then, yes

247
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:10,801
Oh, hold up... hold up

248
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:14,357
This morning was sensational

249
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:16,400
Oh, I can't...
sorry, I can't hear you

250
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:17,935
I can't hear you

251
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,449
Gerry, can you hear me?

252
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:20,374
Didn't know it was on

253
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:22,384
Ready, steady, go!

254
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,998
I'll see you, Clive

255
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,181
Who's that?

256
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:33,428
My friend

257
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:38,064
Come on, you... Let's get you home.
You drunken eejit

258
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,038
And again

259
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:44,566
Come along

260
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:47,857
Can I give you a lift anywhere?

261
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:50,713
Er... yeah.
That, that'll be great, thank you

262
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,951
Oh, hands up
if you drank too much, eh?

263
00:23:54,524 --> 00:23:56,531
Hey... I'm not as drunk
as thinkle peep I am

264
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,809
Put a wick in her mouth
and she'd burn for a fortnight

265
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:07,291
Um, 9 Menlove Avenue. Thanks a lot

266
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,537
French bean, some chicken,
some rice...

267
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:14,131
...one more little Indian

268
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,791
No. Oh, come on.
Really, I'll be sick

269
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,584
Well, we're on schedule for that
but we've gotta move location...

270
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,278
...so just don't swallow
for ten minutes

271
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,329
He didn't fancy me

272
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:29,114
He, he offered us a lift.
He was just being concerned

273
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,792
Uh-huh... Well let me tell you,
if he was being that concerned about me

274
00:24:32,894 --> 00:24:34,836
...I wouldn't be helping you
into bed right now

275
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:37,140
Am lin bed?

276
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,513
Yes... You're staying with me
for a while

277
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,370
Don't worry... You'll be fine

278
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,899
Just fine

279
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:48,469
There we go. There we go

280
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:58,783
Are you some peculiar, thus far
undefined breed of dickhead?

281
00:24:59,553 --> 00:25:02,487
You have two head problems

282
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,196
One: That was close... Very close

283
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:10,459
Put in layman's terms...
she nearly caught you

284
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,744
And two... and this is far
more worrying than the first one

285
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,832
You're talking to yourself
in the mirror again

286
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,421
Really bad sign

287
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:42,074
No, bigger sip... big, bigger sip.
Bigger sip... Don't throw up all over me

288
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:47,927
There are no PR jobs

289
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:52,406
I'm going to need
some part-time work, Gerry

290
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,567
What you need is a change of image

291
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:01,923
Er, you know that goes back like and then like
I don't know sort of comes like slant

292
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:38,179
No, no...
That's for you, sir

293
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:11,622
Hey, gorgeous. What do you do when you're not
serving up 'mad cow' burgers in here, eh?

294
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,124
Well now then, let me see

295
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:14,653
I get up about seven thirty a. M...

296
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,149
...make and deliver sandwiches
in the West End during the day...

297
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:19,676
...before I come here about
six o' clock and finish at midnight

298
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:23,012
After that, if I've got any energy left,
I give my boyfriend a blow job

299
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:25,283
Would you like some mayonnaise
with that?

300
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:27,620
You don't mean that

301
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:29,410
I do... Really

302
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,474
So... you were together two
and a half years, and...

303
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:37,278
...you've been sitting here
like suicide on a stick for a week

304
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,294
Nine days, Anna

305
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:41,668
But bollocks to him?

306
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:46,406
Yes. I mean why hasn't he even called to see
if I'm okay to admit that he's a twat?

307
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:49,095
"Hello, Helen, it's Gerry

308
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:51,713
I'm a twat. Please come home,
I love you. " All that shit

309
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:54,783
Oh, I don't care anyway Bollocks
to him. I'm over him

310
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:56,869
Oh... you're over him

311
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:00,264
Yes. Totally and utterly
and completely over him

312
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,125
No, you're not

313
00:28:01,224 --> 00:28:01,922
I am

314
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:02,722
You're not

315
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:05,827
Anna, I'm over him. What do you mean
I'm not? How do you know I'm not?

316
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:09,127
Well, two things really

317
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:11,647
One: You're still counting how
long you've been apart in days...

318
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,509
...and probably hours and minutes

319
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,808
But... the big flashing red light way of
telling you're not really over someone

320
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:18,694
...is when you're still
reading their horoscope...

321
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:21,446
in the hope that they're going to get wiped out
in some freak napalming incident

322
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,108
Smart arse

323
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:25,482
What is he?

324
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:26,624
A wanker

325
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:29,349
Oh, Aries

326
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:31,306
Aries. Aries

327
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:36,576
Well... just shows how much I know

328
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,773
With Mars your ruler in the ascendancy... you will
get wiped out in a freak napalming incident

329
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,949
...and Helen says bollocks to you
This guy's very good

330
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:50,655
You go. No, I will. No, you

331
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:54,722
I'm not in, I'm out.
You don't know where or who with

332
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:56,452
Specially who with

333
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:59,010
Quickly, go on

334
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,451
I am not answering the door
like this

335
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:04,615
Anna, please, you have to.
It won't be him anyway

336
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,407
So there's no big deal, is there?

337
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:14,018
Bollocks to him

338
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:16,197
Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him

339
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,339
Bollocks to him

340
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:33,548
Come on. You don't drink your fatty drinks,
you'll never really achieve quality cellulite

341
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:36,938
Haircut suits you by the way.
No, it does. It does, no gag

342
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:42,792
Never make a joke about women's hair,
clothes or menstrual cycles, page one

343
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:45,578
Look, James,
maybe I shouldn't be here

344
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:48,363
I'm sorry, I'm not being fair

345
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:54,607
You know, under normal... circumstances,
et cetera... you're really nice... and funny

346
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:57,965
My friend Anna thinks you're cute

347
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,590
Wait, hold, hold

348
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,991
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?!

349
00:30:03,984 --> 00:30:06,571
Shit, I just blew, wait...

350
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,643
Two eighty-five,
two eighty-five on the wrong girl

351
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:12,587
Helen, listen...

352
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:15,944
sometimes we are plonked into people's lives
when they just need to be cheered up and reassured

353
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:21,321
...and it turns out that
for some reason it's your job

354
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:23,019
We don't know why.
In your case it's my job

355
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,674
But I'll be honest...

356
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:30,925
the fact that I find you... moderately attractive
just makes the job easier on my part

357
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:35,626
My intentions are completely honourable
I have no desire to overstep the mark, seriously

358
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,433
D'you prefer diamonds or sapphires?

359
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,746
Sorry, nothing

360
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,540
'Moderately attractive'?

361
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,292
Uh-huh, I knew you were listening

362
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,875
Well, you know, lose the sad eyes,
the droopy mouth, I could get you an upgrade

363
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,421
So... having firml y established
the ground rules...

364
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,280
...what are you doing
two weeks on Saturday?

365
00:30:55,443 --> 00:30:56,552
Probably killing myself

366
00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:58,632
Excellent.
What time does that finish?

367
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:00,112
Do you like boats?

368
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:05,098
D'you know we haven't done that
for two months

369
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,058
Don't be daft

370
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:09,874
Two months... Almost to the day

371
00:31:10,673 --> 00:31:13,545
Almost to the day? Listen to you
what are we, a survey?

372
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,237
Gerry...

373
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:20,689
...how did one of my Waterford crystal
brandy glasses get into the laundry basket?

374
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:22,543
To the where?

375
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:23,919
The laundry basket

376
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:28,747
I don't know. Can I answer
questions on 70s pop music?

377
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:32,300
Last week, when I got the sack
and I came back, am I going mad?

378
00:31:32,403 --> 00:31:35,820
But there was a bottle of brandy and two
glasses on the dressing table, wasn't there?

379
00:31:36,787 --> 00:31:38,479
I don't know.
I mean, I couldn't really say

380
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,075
Well, there were, I'm sure

381
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,798
Oh, hang on, no, wait a minute.
No, I, no, I could say

382
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,715
There was a bottle and one glass
because if you...

383
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:47,983
No, I'm certain there
were two glasses, Gerry

384
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:51,861
Helen, I'm... not sure I like
where this conversation is going

385
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:56,116
I, I told you, I couldn't sleep
so I got up in the night...

386
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:57,588
to get a drink to
knock myself out It was still there

387
00:31:57,685 --> 00:31:58,579
in the afternoon when you got home

388
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:01,429
I mean you had also, that day if,
if you remember had taken a blow

389
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:03,348
to the, the, the, the head

390
00:32:04,597 --> 00:32:05,744
We'd just had a party

391
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:09,075
Maybe one of y our mad friends
like Anna threw it there

392
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,214
I mean, Jesus

393
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:15,541
Let's, let's spoil the moment
properly, shall we?

394
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:16,718
What are you trying to say?

395
00:32:16,823 --> 00:32:19,212
Am I shagging a brandy drinker? Yes

396
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:22,864
Gerry, ease up, will you,
for Christ's sake. I'm only asking

397
00:32:23,383 --> 00:32:27,127
Oh, no, women never ask.
No, they don't ask, they insinuate

398
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:30,736
And you are insinuating, not very subtly,
may I add, that I am...

399
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,084
Thanks

400
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:40,374
No, no, no. No, no, no, no,
thank you, thanks

401
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,117
I mean... I mean thank you...
thank you

402
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,826
I mean this, you know, this,
this is the... this is the right time,

403
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:50,263
isn't it, to address our,
our relationship, isn't it?

404
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,395
I mean, it's, it's, it's perfect.
Perfect moment

405
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:56,530
Gerry, for God's sakes,
I asked a simple question

406
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:58,389
There's no need to
become Woody Allen

407
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,391
Thanks, James. I'm sorry
if you had a lousy time

408
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:14,512
Are you kidding?

409
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:17,007
In my book getting to drink
two chocolate milkshakes

410
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:18,903
in the one sitting represents
social splendour

411
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,692
It's one of the perks
of being shallow

412
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:23,385
Take care, Helen. You'll be fine

413
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,079
Thank you very much

414
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:53,434
It's amazing how you can actually learn
to despise inanimate objects...

415
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:55,157
...like tin openers
that don't open tins...

416
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,496
...egg mayonnaise and skipjack tuna

417
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:58,967
Are you going out?

418
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,202
Yeah. I was just writing you a note

419
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:03,218
I'm off to the library.
I have some stuff to read up on

420
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:04,822
Okay

421
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,668
Yeah, well... I won't be
more than a couple of hours

422
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,121
Would you rather I didn't go?

423
00:34:11,228 --> 00:34:13,016
Oh no, no, of course not. Go

424
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:15,732
Okay, bye

425
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:05,630
Lydia, what are you talking about?
She followed me

426
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,865
I said I was going
to the library...

427
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,586
...so I've come to the library,
for God's sake!

428
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,648
Of course I can't come now,
I mean what if she's still lurking

429
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,574
or waiting round the corner
or something?

430
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,577
Lydia, I don't know
why she followed me.

431
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:20,857
I'm not a sleuth! I have taken
two hours off work, Gerry...

432
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,220
Oh, look, look, please. No, okay,
please don't get hysterical

433
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:26,589
Don't get hysterical.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry

434
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:29,336
I've booked a hotel in Dorset.
Are we still going?

435
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:32,540
Do you wanna cancel it? I mean,
is, is she gonna follow us there?

436
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,364
Do you wanna end this Gerry
because I am...

437
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,953
Yes, I, I, I mean no. I, I mean,
no, I, I don't want

438
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:40,439
Of course we're still going.
I don't... don't, don't...

439
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,322
Don't, don't, don't, don't what?

440
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:45,182
I don't know

441
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:48,927
Look... we're going to dorset, okay.
We're going to have a great time... and, er

442
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:52,091
...I'll talk to you tomorrow

443
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:04,892
Right, that's the lot.
You don't live there anymore

444
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:07,064
Thanks for going again, Anna

445
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,520
Any evidence of 'her'?

446
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:11,936
Nothing that stood out

447
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:16,896
Hello?

448
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,256
Hi, it's James. Is Helen there?

449
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:20,542
Helen

450
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:23,385
It's James

451
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,592
Hello?

452
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:34,140
Yes, 'tonight' tonight, you know the tonight
that comes immediately after today

453
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:37,219
He wants to go out tonight

454
00:36:37,315 --> 00:36:38,842
Go

455
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,573
Please come, it'll be a laugh

456
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:43,164
Um... okay

457
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:45,884
See you

458
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:49,277
Okay?

459
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,388
She doesn't wanna leave here

460
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:53,315
I know

461
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:56,674
She's really frail, James.
Do you want me to postpone my trip?

462
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:58,232
There's another course later
in the year

463
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:00,250
It's only a couple of weeks.
You should go

464
00:37:00,356 --> 00:37:01,697
Are you sure?
It's not that important

465
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:04,383
It is important. I want you to go

466
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,500
Okay

467
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:08,479
It's going to be hard to
leave this place, James, but...

468
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,820
But you've still
got the London flat

469
00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:14,623
You'll be nearer the hospital and you
can get much better crack in twon

470
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:19,171
Hey, you know
what the Monty Python boys say...

471
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,501
"Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition", I know

472
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:24,130
Exactly

473
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:25,605
...sorry, let me just...

474
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:28,615
...Lydia's becoming
more and more demanding...

475
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,466
and you, you feel bad because
Helen's working night and

476
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,390
day to keep the money coming in

477
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,740
But you've asked Helen to come on
a research trip to Dorset with you...

478
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:40,765
knowing that she wouldn't be
able to... to cover up the fact...

479
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,140
that you're really taking Lydia
And, and despite the fact that...

480
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:46,054
Lydia gave you an 'out' on
the phone, which you didn't take...

481
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,557
...you are having a moral dilemma

482
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:50,689
Gerry... you are
a morality free zone

483
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,158
If I had no morals,
would I be discussing it?

484
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:57,032
Whose idea was this trip...
yours or Lydia's?

485
00:37:59,592 --> 00:38:01,251
You wanna get out
of this Lydia thing

486
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,978
I foresee problems

487
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,150
And I wouldn't mind betting you're talking
to yourself in the mirror again

488
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,317
Very bad sign

489
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,873
You've no compassion... None

490
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:14,693
Why do I bother confiding in you?

491
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,606
I'm your mate. I'm here to help you

492
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:24,266
I'm here to help you

493
00:38:29,353 --> 00:38:31,492
Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition!

494
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:33,831
Our chief weapon is surprise

495
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,313
Surprise and fear.
Fear and surprise

496
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,641
Our two, two chief weapons
are surprise and fear

497
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:39,265
And a ruthless efficiency.
Our three...

498
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:42,272
...three main weapons are fear,
surprise and a ruthless efficiency

499
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,168
I'll come in again

500
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:48,738
Here we go

501
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:52,618
Pass me your plate

502
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:54,625
How do you do, Nigel?
Very nice to meet you

503
00:38:57,226 --> 00:38:59,083
You all right?

504
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:05,448
I am deadly serious

505
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:07,785
Oh, just set up my own PR company?

506
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:09,346
Yeah, well, why not?

507
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:12,171
You've got the experience...
the know-how, the contacts

508
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,631
You want to spend the rest of
your life working for other people?

509
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,313
Hey, what's the worst
that could possibly happen?

510
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:21,033
Um, I could fail miserably
and look like a complete tosser

511
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,140
Exactly, so what is there
to worry about?

512
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,969
I had a really nice time, James

513
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:36,069
Did you? Oh, shit. Sorry,
that's against the rules, isn't it?

514
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:38,923
Yes, it is, so just bear that
in mind in the future, would you?

515
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:41,061
I'm getting over a major break-up

516
00:39:41,164 --> 00:39:43,435
Yeah, sorry... Won't happen again

517
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,429
Goodnight, Helen

518
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:58,158
Hey... you know everything happens
for the best

519
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:00,327
You'll never know if you don't try

520
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,497
Wear something warm on Saturday...
Can get cold on the river

521
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:05,286
Take care

522
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:24,842
So, what other ideas has James
run by you?

523
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:28,492
Anna, don't do that. Don't do
'desperate mother' acting with me

524
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,828
He's a friend. Okay? A friend

525
00:40:35,214 --> 00:40:36,973
not remotely in him
No

526
00:40:37,712 --> 00:40:40,495
So how come last night was the first night
since you've been here... you didn't ask

527
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,447
if anyone had called
the second you walked in the door?

528
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:28,915
You're sorry?

529
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:32,658
You're sorry that four of the staff
here have been cut down... with food poisoning

530
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:34,699
after eating your sandwiches?

531
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:36,787
And before you speak, yes...

532
00:41:36,882 --> 00:41:40,300
...they all had the same sandwiches
and the same symptoms at the same time

533
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,241
Are you trained
in the catering trade, may I ask?

534
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:45,874
No, actually I worked in PR
but I...

535
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:49,485
Well, you're not doing a particularly good
PR job this morning, are you?

536
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,491
Luckily for you I've convinced my
colleagues not to take the matter any further

537
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:55,345
This time

538
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:57,965
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have five people's work to do

539
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:01,292
Sorry?

540
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:04,113
Helen has been delivering
sandwiches to your office?

541
00:42:04,212 --> 00:42:06,768
Yes... And today I had reason
to summon her

542
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,557
Well I made up a reason,
to be brutally honest

543
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:13,777
She's quite pretty in a British
horsey sort of way, isn't she?

544
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:16,372
Lydia... what are you playing at?

545
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,925
Have you gone raving mad?
She's not bloody stupid, you know

546
00:42:19,028 --> 00:42:23,823
I wanted to see what the woman
you ditched me for is like

547
00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:27,341
Now, now, now, now wait a sec.
Now I did not ditch you for...

548
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,722
I mean, you went back
to America for...

549
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:32,785
I wanted to see what this girl you seem
to have no intention of leaving...

550
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:37,143
despite the occasional pre-orgasmic
suggestion that you are...

551
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:39,475
...has that is so unleavable

552
00:42:39,574 --> 00:42:42,575
And I have to say that I ended our
brief meeting at a bit of a loss

553
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,035
Now, Lydia, don't talk like this.
Now it sounds ugly

554
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:48,689
Now I've told you before,
I cannot leave Helen for... for...

555
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:51,479
you know

556
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:52,557
For me?

557
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:57,262
Is that what
you're trying say?

558
00:42:58,005 --> 00:43:00,495
You can't leave her for me?

559
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:03,278
Well, you haven't said
you wanted that, have you?

560
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:05,359
Gerry, I'm a woman

561
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,669
We don't say what we want.

562
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:10,583
But we reserve the right to
be pissed off if we don't get it

563
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,269
That's what makes us so fascinating

564
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:15,057
And not a little bit scary

565
00:43:17,465 --> 00:43:18,512
Hello?

566
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:21,366
Ah, Gerald Flannigan, at last

567
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:23,701
This is your kindly
Uncle Russell here

568
00:43:24,856 --> 00:43:25,653
Listen...

569
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:29,071
...wherever you were tonight as if
we need to ask, you weren't with me

570
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:30,867
Helen called here looking for you

571
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:32,081
Okay

572
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:32,949
Yeah, all right

573
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,294
Okay, thanks, mate. Bye

574
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:38,454
Oh, thank God, I was so worried.
Where have you been?

575
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,257
I went to Anna's.
I needed to see a friendly face

576
00:43:43,514 --> 00:43:45,139
I've had a horrible day

577
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:48,504
I met Cruella de Ville's
less nice sister this morning...

578
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:50,196
...she completely deflated me

579
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:51,924
I know

580
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:53,936
How do you know?

581
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:57,426
Oh, no, I mean I can tell.
Jesus, you look terrible

582
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:05,874
Where were you earlier?
I really needed to talk to you

583
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:10,839
Oh, I had some stuff to read up on
so I went to the library

584
00:44:11,547 --> 00:44:13,751
God, you're always at the library

585
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,041
I'm sich of waiting on tables

586
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:20,217
I know when you finish the book
we'll be millionaires but...

587
00:44:21,948 --> 00:44:23,607
...when are you going to finish it?

588
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,801
I'm going to finish it
very soon, Helen

589
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:30,137
Very soon

590
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,087
Helen, there's something
I want to tell you

591
00:44:37,403 --> 00:44:39,096
I need to tell you

592
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:45,470
Er... it's a little bit to do
with the... brandy glass and, er...

593
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:48,216
...a little bit to do with
that woman... you met today

594
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:53,149
Only... please let me finish
before you say anything

595
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:55,832
Okay?

596
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,046
Helen?

597
00:45:05,023 --> 00:45:06,134
Bollocks

598
00:45:06,815 --> 00:45:09,236
Come on, James!

599
00:45:11,391 --> 00:45:13,082
Come on, come on!

600
00:45:15,101 --> 00:45:17,437
Come on, come on!

601
00:45:36,704 --> 00:45:37,980
That's really weird

602
00:45:38,078 --> 00:45:40,568
I knew there'd be a boat race going
by with purple and white shirts

603
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,262
Sorry?

604
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:45,500
Why hasn't he asked you to
go with him to Dorset?

605
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:47,544
He has... I've got to work

606
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:50,497
Anyway it'll be good for him
to get away. We need a bit of space

607
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:54,678
Anna, can I ask you
a daft question?

608
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:58,397
Did you drop a glass
in the laundry basket at our party?

609
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:01,851
Sounds like a ridiculous thing
to do. It was almost certainly me

610
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:04,791
Are you okay?

611
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:06,326
Just going quietly mad

612
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,610
Thank God for that. I was worried

613
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,669
Faster

614
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:20,280
And to my left...

615
00:46:20,386 --> 00:46:22,296
And to my right...

616
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,475
And with my left...

617
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:26,139
And with my right...

618
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:29,566
And with the 'head'...

619
00:46:31,169 --> 00:46:36,673
Father Abraham 'head'
had seven sons, head', '¡head'

620
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,450
Seven sons had
Father Abraham 'head'

621
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,258
Are you sure
it's just writer's block?

622
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,593
I mean, you seem so distant

623
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:51,744
I'm here, Gerry, if you need
to talk to me about anything

624
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,598
Hey, that's Helen in there

625
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,009
Look, she's got blonde hair

626
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:03,740
There's loads of them... having some
kind of sponsored epileptic fit

627
00:47:08,196 --> 00:47:09,276
Lydia

628
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:12,767
Maybe it isn't writer's block
at all, Gerry

629
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:15,771
Maybe it's Helen block

630
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:22,463
I don't want to hear about Helen.
I don't care about Helen

631
00:47:25,669 --> 00:47:29,862
The trouble is...
you do quite clearly

632
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:34,558
I just thought of
a great finish for your book!

633
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:38,085
The End!

634
00:47:51,657 --> 00:47:53,411
Yes, you are, Clive

635
00:47:53,511 --> 00:47:56,066
He's opening his first restaurant
in six days...

636
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,372
...and he's completely disorganised

637
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:02,785
Well, you know at my old company we had 'wars '
getting Pierre Claude's restaurant open

638
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:04,960
You did Pierre Claude?

639
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:09,215
Mmm
Er, he's my hero. You did his launch?

640
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:12,546
Well I heard that was a really
classy do. People went on about it

641
00:48:13,798 --> 00:48:15,360
I mean, six days is...

642
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:18,760
...could I come down
and take a look?

643
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:21,060
I can't promise anything stupendous

644
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:24,424
Sure, yeah. Yeah, no problem...
You're kidding?

645
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,114
Yeah, come down

646
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:28,607
Pierre Claude? Oh, wow!

647
00:48:32,904 --> 00:48:36,200
You're very thoughtful, James.
You give out an incredible amount

648
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:40,354
Oh, you're the same.
You encouraged me today

649
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,497
I saw you jumping up
and down like a mad thing

650
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:44,967
Spurred me on

651
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:51,303
I love this bridge. My great
grandfather helped to build it

652
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:56,772
I often come and... stand on it
when I want to, um...

653
00:48:58,314 --> 00:48:59,940
Build a bridge?

654
00:49:00,746 --> 00:49:02,089
I'm sorry

655
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:11,525
Oh God, James, don't

656
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:14,953
Oh... I'm sorry. I, I...

657
00:49:15,658 --> 00:49:20,231
...I know this is an ideal sort
of kissing moment...

658
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,301
...you know, night, moon, boat,
water lapping...

659
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:26,788
...you know, it's, um... i
t's perfect and I'm...

660
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,090
...I'm not feeling that
it would be nice...

661
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:32,710
...but I don't really know anything
about you and I'm...

662
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:36,068
...I'm still on the rebound

663
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:38,790
Oh God, I hate that word but I am

664
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,967
Ah, who isn't? Everyone is

665
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:44,069
I'm on the rebound myself...
in a way...

666
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:48,485
So, who are you
on the rebound from?

667
00:49:49,773 --> 00:49:51,683
A girl called Pamela

668
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,571
My whole life pivots around.
Pam and I breaking up

669
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:55,750
When was that?

670
00:49:55,853 --> 00:49:57,796
1973, we were eight

671
00:49:59,149 --> 00:50:01,322
I bloody loved that woman

672
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:05,132
No warning, just up gone...
left me for somebody else

673
00:50:05,775 --> 00:50:06,855
Who?

674
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:09,062
Gary Glitter!
The cow

675
00:50:09,164 --> 00:50:12,615
Gary Glitter, for crying out loud!

676
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:17,551
I mean all my friends were being left for
Donny Osmond or David Cassidy or...

677
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,786
I could have come to
terms with that, given time

678
00:50:20,396 --> 00:50:23,433
But Gary. Oh she wanted
to 'touch him there, yeah'

679
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:25,513
You know?

680
00:50:25,614 --> 00:50:27,721
Well, I went to pieces
as you can imagine

681
00:50:27,823 --> 00:50:30,159
And there was no 'junior Prozac'
to see me through so...

682
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:43,565
So I, er, I, um...

683
00:50:43,663 --> 00:50:44,591
I kissed you

684
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:46,694
Yeah, yeah, I spotted that too

685
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,623
You weren't gonna do that

686
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:53,964
Um, hmm... would you mind, um...
just putting that down to

687
00:50:54,062 --> 00:50:56,367
a momentary lapse of,
um, concentration?

688
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,022
Is that what it was?

689
00:50:58,128 --> 00:50:59,437
No

690
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:02,026
Y-yes, I don't... Oh, help

691
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:11,945
I, I don't want to be a confusion
in your life, Helen. I don't truly

692
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,690
But something's happened to me
since I've met you and...

693
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:20,523
...that I wasn't expecting and...
and I don't really...

694
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:24,176
...well, well wasn't expecting

695
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,145
Repetition of expecting.
Must buy a thesaurus

696
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:28,145
Anyway, I...

697
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:37,036
You did remember to take a full page
ad in 'Adulterer's Weekly'? Jesus!

698
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,176
Lydia, get in the car, will you?

699
00:52:44,277 --> 00:52:46,449
How many years have you been going
to paint that stain off?

700
00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:10,006
He didn't even pay the bill?
Of course not. What do you think?

701
00:54:10,105 --> 00:54:12,474
Um I'm, I'm just... Would you excuse me,
please? I've just remembered I, I'm...

702
00:54:16,763 --> 00:54:18,869
What do you mean you
want to see me?

703
00:54:18,971 --> 00:54:22,355
Jesus Christ, Gerry, what...
How did you get in?

704
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:25,755
One of the waiters is,
is a, a friend of Russell's

705
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:27,956
He got me a ticket.
It's a great do, Helen

706
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:30,132
I, I hear your company's
really taken off...

707
00:54:30,235 --> 00:54:33,302
Gerry, you can't
just turn up like this

708
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,965
This is a really important nights
for me

709
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:36,593
Yes, I can, Helen

710
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:40,630
I can 'just turn up'. It, it's the most
important 'just turn up' I've ever done

711
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,837
Oh God. We, we can't talk in here

712
00:54:49,948 --> 00:54:53,081
We've been through too much just
to drop this. Haven't we? Surely

713
00:54:57,147 --> 00:54:58,195
Helen...

714
00:54:58,685 --> 00:55:00,213
...please, look at me

715
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:04,085
I'm sorry

716
00:55:06,365 --> 00:55:07,861
Really sorry

717
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,255
You're too good not to fight for.
The last...

718
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:13,911
Oh God, Gerry,
don't talk about fight. I...

719
00:55:20,381 --> 00:55:22,238
Good looking bloke

720
00:55:22,975 --> 00:55:24,350
Are you seeing him?
Er...

721
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,263
I, I'm sorry,
it's not my place to ask

722
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,132
Is that him?

723
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:32,573
Guess so

724
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:34,813
Does she know about Claudia?

725
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,860
No

726
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,133
I really like her, Clive

727
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:41,081
I'm confused.
I feel a bit lost suddenly

728
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:45,017
Gerry, I really have to
go back inside

729
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,549
Will you come and see me, Helen?

730
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:52,159
Please, Helen, there's so much
more I want to say. I miss you

731
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,028
Will you come and see me?

732
00:55:58,399 --> 00:55:59,577
Please, Helen

733
00:56:00,576 --> 00:56:01,306
I'll go.

734
00:56:03,745 --> 00:56:05,087
Thanks for listening. I...

735
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:07,319
...I'm really proud of you

736
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,158
Are you okay?

737
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:34,877
Yes. Just a bit dizzy

738
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:36,406
Too much champagne

739
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:49,050
Oh, sorry

740
00:56:55,555 --> 00:56:57,183
Bye now

741
00:56:57,827 --> 00:56:59,967
Hey... It's official... I love you

742
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:03,899
Thank you. You're...
you're a genius. I'm ecstatic

743
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,395
Have you, er, have you seen James?

744
00:57:07,107 --> 00:57:10,557
Yeah. Yeah, he had to go...
early start. He apologised

745
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,084
Business trip... Newcastle
or something. I didn't want to pry

746
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,709
His secretary
wasn't very forthcoming

747
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:37,532
D'you believe he's away?

748
00:57:37,636 --> 00:57:38,750
Don't know

749
00:57:38,853 --> 00:57:40,162
Or do you think
he's just avoiding you?

750
00:57:40,262 --> 00:57:40,895
I don't know

751
00:57:40,997 --> 00:57:41,890
Did you leave a message?

752
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:42,589
No

753
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,924
D'you think maybe you should have?
Did he actually see Gerry kiss you?

754
00:57:46,022 --> 00:57:47,134
I don't know

755
00:57:47,238 --> 00:57:49,474
D'you think he might be hoping you've called
and not known that you have?

756
00:57:49,574 --> 00:57:51,101
I mean... did you not check
if he has a mobile?

757
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:53,594
Anna! Ease up, will you?
Bloody hell!

758
00:57:54,373 --> 00:57:57,059
They have less questions
than this on 'Jeopardy'

759
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:00,509
I was nervous. I wanted to
get off the phone. I felt awkward

760
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:03,969
Well, it's such a piddly little thing.
It's hardly worth him getting up tight about

761
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:06,340
Oh, Gerry called by the way

762
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:09,922
Terrific. That's just...

763
00:58:10,598 --> 00:58:13,055
Two months ago I want Gerry
to come round, James comes round

764
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,297
Now I want James to call,
Gerry calls

765
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:28,061
It was the weirdest dream.
You were there

766
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:32,193
And you had a funny mask
over your face...

767
00:58:32,296 --> 00:58:35,974
...and you had something that you needed
to tell me but you couldn't say it

768
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,784
Well that does it, I'm afraid. I'm, er,
taking away your class one drugs for a week

769
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:45,858
Anyway... um... there's something
else I wanted to tell you

770
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:50,374
I fainted at work the other night

771
00:58:50,984 --> 00:58:53,571
Oh, sweetheart. Are you okay?

772
00:58:53,673 --> 00:58:57,798
Yes, but I don't normally faint
so I, um...

773
00:58:59,976 --> 00:59:01,668
What was that?

774
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:05,120
I don't know. The people next door are plainly
engaged in some bizarre sexual ritual

775
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:08,261
I may pop in later
and introduce myself

776
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,785
What were you saying?

777
00:59:10,888 --> 00:59:12,319
Anyway...

778
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,559
...I don't normally faint
so I was a little curious...

779
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,405
Oh shit...

780
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:26,120
...I stubbed my foot
on the side of the shagging bath

781
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:28,487
God, sounds horrific

782
00:59:28,586 --> 00:59:29,732
I know

783
00:59:30,826 --> 00:59:32,004
Ssshhh!
Anyway...

784
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:37,190
Listen, there,
there's the landlady.

785
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:38,274
She keeps coming up with these,
er... corned beef sandwiches

786
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:41,511
Look I, I'll phone you back when, er,
world war twelve has stopped for tea. Okay

787
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,955
Okay, bye

788
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,166
So I did a test and it turns out
that I'm pregnant

789
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,264
I just though you might
like to know

790
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:57,964
Have you gone completely insane?

791
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,173
What are you trying to do?

792
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:02,060
What do you mean 'what am I trying
to do'? I think I've broke my toe

793
01:00:02,157 --> 01:00:06,632
Lydia, I'm on the pissing phone
to Helen, for goodness sake

794
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:10,215
In case you've forgotten,
she doesn't know you're here

795
01:00:10,701 --> 01:00:13,768
She thinks I'm on a research
trip... along. Remember?

796
01:00:14,382 --> 01:00:15,625
I remeber

797
01:00:16,588 --> 01:00:18,859
Don't worry, I remeber.
It's pretty hard to forget

798
01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:20,813
So what are you trying to do? Huh?!

799
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:25,320
Coming in here... screeching the
place down when I'm on the phone

800
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:28,037
Don't you know, Gerry?

801
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:31,820
Don't you know
what I am trying to do?!

802
01:00:33,135 --> 01:00:36,136
I am trying to
be your girlfriend, Gerry

803
01:00:36,813 --> 01:00:38,888
I am trying to win you back!

804
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:43,747
It's fairly simple. I am standing
on the platform at Limbo Central...

805
01:00:43,854 --> 01:00:46,955
...with my heart and soul packed
in my suitcase...

806
01:00:47,055 --> 01:00:51,366
...waiting for the Gerry fucking
Express to roll in...

807
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:55,020
...and tell me that my ticket
is still valid, that I may reboard the train

808
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,800
Only the station announcer keeps coming on
and telling me that my train has been delayed

809
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:07,022
...as the driver has suffered a major
panic attack in Indecision City!

810
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,968
"We suggest you take the bus!"

811
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:13,362
That's what I am trying to do,
you cripple!

812
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:26,766
Except it's quite clear...

813
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:30,635
...that that is
never going to happen

814
01:01:32,176 --> 01:01:33,551
Is it?

815
01:01:35,152 --> 01:01:36,812
No reply

816
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:39,590
Perfect

817
01:01:40,946 --> 01:01:44,295
So I... I'm not waiting
any more, Gerry

818
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:49,897
I am cashing my ticket in.
I am taking that bus

819
01:01:50,738 --> 01:01:51,982
Oh God...

820
01:01:52,466 --> 01:01:55,817
I tell all my friends
"never go back"

821
01:01:57,011 --> 01:01:58,833
Look at me, I must be crazy

822
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:01,742
Don't phone me for a while

823
01:02:05,651 --> 01:02:09,134
Ow! Oh!
No... don't phone me at all!

824
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:10,217
Ever!

825
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:13,067
It's over!

826
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,111
Again!

827
01:02:18,132 --> 01:02:20,980
I've done it, Russell.
I've bloody done it!

828
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:23,401
EXcellent. Congratulations.
Done what?

829
01:02:23,508 --> 01:02:24,719
I've finished it

830
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,122
Oh, the book... Oh well, great,
mate, that's great

831
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,557
Not the book, not the book, Russell

832
01:02:29,652 --> 01:02:31,564
I'm a novelist, I'm never gonna
finish the book...

833
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,425
The affair!

834
01:02:33,524 --> 01:02:35,381
The affair!
The sordid affair with Lydia

835
01:02:35,476 --> 01:02:37,365
I've blown her out... in Dorset

836
01:02:37,461 --> 01:02:39,697
I was decisive but fair

837
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:41,259
I've just got back

838
01:02:41,364 --> 01:02:43,951
Oh God, I feel like
I've got out of jail

839
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:47,850
No more deceit, no more I ying
to Helen. It was such a mistake

840
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:50,860
"Never go back", Russell.
But it's over

841
01:02:51,156 --> 01:02:54,322
God, I can't tell you
it's such a good feeling

842
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:58,806
Well, I'm, I'm very pleased.
How does she feel about it, Lydia?

843
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,894
Well, you know, she's not jumping
through hoops obviously, I mean...

844
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:06,228
...but, but it's the best thing by
far. By far and away the best thing

845
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:08,532
I mean she, she knows that.
I mean, she will do when she...

846
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:13,454
well, she was upsel I mean bit
farught, you know... obviously

847
01:03:13,558 --> 01:03:15,380
Oh God, oh God, oh God, I feel good

848
01:03:15,476 --> 01:03:18,579
I've got to go home. I wanna be home
before Helen comes back from work

849
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:23,732
Er, no

850
01:03:24,824 --> 01:03:26,679
Because you never buy me flowers
when you're meant to...

851
01:03:26,774 --> 01:03:28,562
...let alone
when you're not meant to

852
01:03:28,664 --> 01:03:29,973
So, yes, I'm a little suspicious

853
01:03:30,071 --> 01:03:32,144
I want to know what else you've
been doing that you're not meant to

854
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:33,589
Wait, hang on

855
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:37,004
Let me get this straight
'cause this is just about brilliant

856
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,153
I buy you flowers on a whim in a...

857
01:03:39,255 --> 01:03:43,863
in a, in a fit of, of,
of, um, of romance but...

858
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:46,002
See... you couldn't
even think of the word

859
01:03:46,105 --> 01:03:49,007
But instead of being, of being grateful,
instead of being 'romanced'...

860
01:03:49,112 --> 01:03:54,165
...you're instantly convinced
that I'm ensconced in some decrepit tacky,

861
01:03:54,262 --> 01:03:56,787
underhand clandestine affair!

862
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,709
In a nutshell

863
01:04:09,594 --> 01:04:10,738
Gerry?

864
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:15,222
Are you back?

865
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:18,736
I missed you so I came home early
to see you

866
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,250
God

867
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,438
What are they?

868
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:26,800
Well they're flowers

869
01:04:27,578 --> 01:04:28,757
For you. Um...

870
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:31,318
...d'you not like them?

871
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:36,407
That image of her sitting
on top of you, oh God, I...

872
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:38,896
...I, I really don't know
why I agreed to come

873
01:04:39,002 --> 01:04:41,591
Please stop, Gerry, don't, I,
I don't want you to touch me

874
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,863
I'm, I'm sorry. Um, um, don't go

875
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:48,086
Please try and...
put her out of your mind

876
01:04:49,211 --> 01:04:51,100
She's, she's out of mine

877
01:04:51,195 --> 01:04:53,170
It's finished... over

878
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:55,217
I made a mistake. Such a big...
big mistake and I'm sorry

879
01:04:55,323 --> 01:04:57,333
I'm truly, truly sorry

880
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:02,809
I mean this new bloke, this James
Hammerton that you're seeing...

881
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:05,114
...does he not make mistakes?

882
01:05:05,211 --> 01:05:06,936
How do y ouknow his name?

883
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:09,656
A mate of Russell's works
at the restaurant

884
01:05:09,756 --> 01:05:13,620
They're... mutual friends. I... I mean,
it's not especially important

885
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:16,922
Well I don't want to talk about James Hammerton
or anyone else. I have to go

886
01:05:18,013 --> 01:05:19,539
Oh, by the, by the way I've, er...

887
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:22,739
...I've stopped writing the book

888
01:05:25,276 --> 01:05:30,036
Helen... the truth is
I can't write without you

889
01:05:30,655 --> 01:05:32,344
I can't do anything without you

890
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:36,634
I want you to
come back to me, Helen

891
01:05:39,613 --> 01:05:41,271
We were so good together

892
01:05:42,684 --> 01:05:44,628
Remeber, remember
how good we are together?

893
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,072
Sorry... Just wait

894
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,205
Yeah?

895
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:57,086
I'm late, Gerry... Four days.
I'm never late

896
01:05:57,694 --> 01:06:00,476
Oh, Russell. Er, look, hi

897
01:06:00,574 --> 01:06:02,332
Er, look, mate. Look, er, can I ring you
back in a few minutes, yeah?

898
01:06:02,432 --> 01:06:05,051
Yeah... Yeah, okay. Okay.
Thanks, mate, cheers. Bye

899
01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:07,161
It's, er... Russell

900
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:10,971
I'm, I'm dying for the loo

901
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:32,473
Telephone number 01714443184

902
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,552
To return the call press three

903
01:06:39,394 --> 01:06:41,664
Why are you pretending I'm Russell?
You know I hate that

904
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,998
What's going on?

905
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,199
Gerry, answer me. Who's there?

906
01:06:47,297 --> 01:06:49,665
It's Helen actually. We met once

907
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,966
I interrupted you
faking your orgasm

908
01:06:52,066 --> 01:06:53,975
Sorry I can't be more specific

909
01:06:57,537 --> 01:06:59,064
You know what I was thinking?

910
01:07:00,256 --> 01:07:01,718
You're not going, are you?

911
01:07:02,145 --> 01:07:06,720
You wanker. You sad, sad wonker

912
01:07:08,803 --> 01:07:11,259
God, I feel like such a mug!

913
01:07:11,363 --> 01:07:13,665
The useless, no good...

914
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,632
...shagging, horrible,
despicable, I ying...

915
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:19,227
...two-faced pissing, shagging...

916
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:19,998
You said shagging

917
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:25,889
You know the worst bit?

918
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,803
All I could think about was James

919
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,031
I felt like I was being unfaithful
to James just by being there

920
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:35,101
That sounds like the best bit.
And you were

921
01:07:35,204 --> 01:07:36,929
He didn't call, did he?

922
01:07:39,173 --> 01:07:40,699
That's nearly a week

923
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:44,027
I think I've blown it.
I've blown it, haven't I?

924
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:47,235
I blame British Telecom.
All this new technology

925
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,833
This number if you want
to know who called...

926
01:07:52,933 --> 01:07:56,677
...another one if you don't
want them to know you called...

927
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:00,122
...itemised bills, take away
the first number you thought of

928
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:03,712
I mean they are single-handedly condemning
the average red-blooded Englishman...

929
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,504
...to a life of terminal monogamy

930
01:08:05,605 --> 01:08:07,678
What are they after?
The Nobel Peace Prize?

931
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:09,796
And Lydia might be pregnant

932
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,038
Oh no more, please...
I can't take it

933
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:22,534
Oh this is terrific stuff

934
01:08:22,951 --> 01:08:25,537
I must say, being with you makes
the wait for the next episode of

935
01:08:25,637 --> 01:08:27,712
'Seinfeld' much easier to bear

936
01:08:27,814 --> 01:08:30,336
I didn't reckon on things
turning out this way

937
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:34,018
Everything's a cock up.
What's going on?

938
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:37,447
Well... to use boxing parlance,
if I may... it's quite simple

939
01:08:38,183 --> 01:08:40,256
You've just lost

940
01:08:41,863 --> 01:08:43,685
Are you sure? You've been a bit...

941
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,945
...I don't know, a bit distant
since I've got back

942
01:08:47,048 --> 01:08:48,456
I know

943
01:08:49,255 --> 01:08:50,499
Well, okay...
there are a couple of things.

944
01:08:50,599 --> 01:08:52,544
Which one do you want
to hear first?

945
01:08:53,224 --> 01:08:54,533
I don't mind

946
01:08:54,728 --> 01:08:58,343
Well the 'small'thing is that
I've got an interview for a job

947
01:08:58,441 --> 01:09:00,001
A PR job, a proper one

948
01:09:01,831 --> 01:09:03,906
International company
opening up in London

949
01:09:04,584 --> 01:09:08,741
Chairwoman herself called, said she
had heard a lot about me and...

950
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,809
she's invited me to her apartment
tomorrow evening for a serious chat

951
01:09:13,578 --> 01:09:14,821
Jesus Christ!

952
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:17,509
What?

953
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:23,361
Jesus Christ, I mean that's... that's
not a small thing, that's... that's huge

954
01:09:23,466 --> 01:09:26,631
I mean it's... I mean it's... it's brilliant.
I mean that's the best

955
01:09:26,728 --> 01:09:28,290
Is the blind buggered again?

956
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:30,021
No. Er... no

957
01:09:30,121 --> 01:09:31,530
Well, I...

958
01:09:39,307 --> 01:09:40,290
Are you all right?

959
01:09:40,394 --> 01:09:44,619
Yeah, no, I'm fine, darling.
My sweetheart, that's great, it's tremendous

960
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:46,090
I'm thrilled. I'm so thrill...

961
01:09:47,019 --> 01:09:47,749
Hello?

962
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,410
I really need to talk to you

963
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:51,748
Hi, Russ. How are you?

964
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:55,627
Come by my apartment tomorrow night
at eight. It's important

965
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:59,744
Ah, really, mate. No, what a drag

966
01:09:59,851 --> 01:10:01,096
Oh no, yeah. Okay, yeah, sure.
Sure, sure, yeah

967
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:03,269
Yeah, yeah, I'll help you

968
01:10:03,371 --> 01:10:04,778
Yeah, yeah, cheers, mate.
Cheers. Bye

969
01:10:05,803 --> 01:10:07,976
It's Russell's family
is descending unannounced

970
01:10:08,267 --> 01:10:10,177
Yeah, he wants me to, er,
go round tomorrow evening and,

971
01:10:10,284 --> 01:10:13,354
er... help him clear out,
er, his spare room

972
01:10:15,275 --> 01:10:16,870
Er, right. Okay. So...

973
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,459
Sorry, what was the other thing
you wanted to tell me?

974
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,947
Doesn't matter. It's not important

975
01:10:54,382 --> 01:10:55,844
Hammerton Enterprises

976
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:03,052
Rachael, I'm going out to the shops

977
01:11:03,502 --> 01:11:05,129
Can I get you anything?
No thanks

978
01:11:06,736 --> 01:11:08,012
Are you okay?

979
01:11:08,111 --> 01:11:09,836
Yes

980
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,936
Yes. Yes, I'm fine

981
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,390
I just... you know, I go to
the shops, just I'll be, um...

982
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:52,140
Sorry

983
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,522
Hello!
Hi. Hi Hi

984
01:11:58,482 --> 01:11:59,790
How... how are you?

985
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:01,929
I'm... I'm great

986
01:12:02,033 --> 01:12:03,442
Er, how are you?

987
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:05,808
Sorry, you're great

988
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:10,799
Business lunch?

989
01:12:10,898 --> 01:12:12,807
Yeah, just a chat, you know

990
01:12:13,554 --> 01:12:14,961
Well my office
is just round the corner

991
01:12:15,057 --> 01:12:19,281
I know. Um... I, I, I thought
you were away on business

992
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,641
Yeah, I was. I just, I, um,
got back last night as a matter of, er

993
01:12:25,682 --> 01:12:28,368
Helen, look, please
don't think that I, that I...

994
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:31,465
Ah... it's okay, I...
I haven't thought

995
01:12:31,572 --> 01:12:33,807
I mean I, I,
I didn't think that or not

996
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:37,455
No, I mean... don't think
that I have not called you

997
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,465
I haven't 'not' called you

998
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:41,395
I mean, I don't... I don't mean
I haven't 'not' called you

999
01:12:41,493 --> 01:12:43,566
because that's a double negative...

1000
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:45,131
...so as to say
that I 'have' called you

1001
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:46,382
When did you call?

1002
01:12:46,485 --> 01:12:48,206
Er, well I, I didn't

1003
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:53,805
But I... I didn't 'not' call you in the way
that you might think I didn't call you

1004
01:12:53,908 --> 01:12:55,818
Oh dear

1005
01:12:57,749 --> 01:13:00,139
I wanted to call you

1006
01:13:00,244 --> 01:13:02,734
I even did that dial all but the
last number thing and then not, er...

1007
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,969
It's... ridiculous behaviour

1008
01:13:06,069 --> 01:13:07,564
Totally

1009
01:13:08,789 --> 01:13:11,889
You see, I... I thought you still had to
deal with, with your other, er...

1010
01:13:13,078 --> 01:13:14,355
Gerry?!

1011
01:13:14,454 --> 01:13:16,364
Well I don't know,
is that... yeah, if...

1012
01:13:16,469 --> 01:13:18,510
And I thought it was best
if I allowed youto...

1013
01:13:18,613 --> 01:13:20,948
Gerry is why you haven't called me?

1014
01:13:21,077 --> 01:13:24,942
Well, after Clive's party I didn't
want to just presume that you'd, that we had

1015
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:28,146
You think I just go to bed with all successful
oarsmen that I come across?

1016
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:32,305
Sorry, nervous humour

1017
01:13:33,206 --> 01:13:34,550
Well I hoped not

1018
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,572
Sorry, excuse me

1019
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,028
Hello?

1020
01:13:44,278 --> 01:13:45,588
Oh, I see. I'll, um...

1021
01:13:47,832 --> 01:13:50,352
...I'll come straight away.
Okay, thanks

1022
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:54,030
My... mum had to go into hospital

1023
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:56,591
She's had some tests done. The results
are through. I should, er, go

1024
01:13:58,296 --> 01:13:59,888
Do you want me to come with you?

1025
01:14:02,968 --> 01:14:04,943
Yeah, that's really nice of you

1026
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,568
Er... well maybe, um...

1027
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:12,048
I don't... she's quite frail
and I, and I don't know how she's gonna...

1028
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:13,398
It's okay

1029
01:14:14,392 --> 01:14:15,767
but, um... thanks

1030
01:14:19,128 --> 01:14:21,432
I'm, er, well some friends are
having dinner at Clive's tonight...

1031
01:14:21,528 --> 01:14:24,758
...if you're, if you're not doing
anything, you want to come along

1032
01:14:27,322 --> 01:14:28,632
Well some other time

1033
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,553
I'd love to if that's okay

1034
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:37,012
Yeah, yeah. Of course, crikey,
it's, it's, it's very, very okay, yeah

1035
01:14:38,905 --> 01:14:42,168
But well, at the risk of sounding
old-fashioned, I'll pick you up at eight

1036
01:14:42,266 --> 01:14:44,951
Is that a 'will' pick me up,
or a 'haven't, not, didn't, might'?

1037
01:14:47,547 --> 01:14:50,264
Listen... don't worry
about your mum. She'll be okay

1038
01:14:51,163 --> 01:14:53,073
Remember Monty Python

1039
01:14:55,194 --> 01:14:56,601
Well I'll see you later

1040
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:00,855
Bye

1041
01:15:12,219 --> 01:15:14,108
How are you?
Yeah, just... you know...

1042
01:15:18,171 --> 01:15:19,929
Is Gerry excited
about being a daddy?

1043
01:15:20,027 --> 01:15:21,784
I haven't told him yet

1044
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:24,984
Never seems to
be the right moment somehow

1045
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:28,247
Come on... let's celebrate
with a proper drink

1046
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:30,581
Bloody marvellous idea

1047
01:15:32,349 --> 01:15:35,580
I really shouldn't in my condition
but I'm really going to

1048
01:15:35,677 --> 01:15:37,053
What have you got?

1049
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,736
Um... brandy

1050
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:41,724
Oh, no, yuk. Makes me vomit

1051
01:16:57,474 --> 01:16:58,849
Half day?

1052
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,980
James?!

1053
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:09,985
Since last night?

1054
01:17:12,642 --> 01:17:13,984
Sorry

1055
01:17:15,459 --> 01:17:16,668
You can't tell from one

1056
01:17:17,602 --> 01:17:18,912
They can be inaccurate

1057
01:17:19,779 --> 01:17:21,153
I bought three packets

1058
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:23,489
Two in a packet, that's six

1059
01:17:24,194 --> 01:17:25,821
You can tell from six

1060
01:17:27,489 --> 01:17:28,701
What are you gonna do?

1061
01:17:35,554 --> 01:17:37,150
Is James Hammerton in?

1062
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:38,747
I'm afraid not

1063
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:40,445
Um, do you know when he's due back?

1064
01:17:40,548 --> 01:17:43,746
I'm not sure. He's gone to visit his mother
in hospital with his wife

1065
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,011
Would you like to leave a message?

1066
01:17:47,812 --> 01:17:49,187
What?

1067
01:17:49,285 --> 01:17:51,260
Can I take a name and number?
Get him to call you

1068
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,863
Um... no, thank you

1069
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:43,484
There's something
I want you to know

1070
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:48,384
Anna doesn't drink Brandy, Gerry,
it makes her vomit

1071
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:53,664
and those glasses were
not used at the party

1072
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:55,939
They only come out for
special dinners, you know that

1073
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:00,927
Am I meant to immediately
get the reference here?

1074
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:03,526
Are you having an affair?

1075
01:19:04,776 --> 01:19:06,686
Just tell me yes or no

1076
01:19:10,377 --> 01:19:12,745
No, I'm not

1077
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:24,291
Helen, look into my eyes

1078
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:27,716
I am not having an affair

1079
01:19:30,154 --> 01:19:31,331
I'm not

1080
01:19:36,202 --> 01:19:38,723
Well, I shouldn't have brought this up now,
I've got to go to my interview

1081
01:19:41,065 --> 01:19:42,440
We'll talk later

1082
01:19:44,394 --> 01:19:46,467
Are you going to be here
when I get back?

1083
01:19:46,569 --> 01:19:48,675
Yes. Of course

1084
01:19:52,266 --> 01:19:54,056
Helen... listen

1085
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:57,090
Good luck, okay

1086
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:07,621
Hello

1087
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:09,666
Hi, Anna, is Helen there?

1088
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:11,461
You've got a damned nerve
phoning here

1089
01:20:12,076 --> 01:20:13,450
What?

1090
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:20,582
Anna, please, just open the door.
I don't know what's going on

1091
01:20:21,547 --> 01:20:22,725
You dono't know what's going on?

1092
01:20:22,826 --> 01:20:26,573
I'll tell you then. She saw you, James,
at the hospital. With your wife

1093
01:20:26,669 --> 01:20:28,392
You know, the one
with the wedding ring

1094
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:29,441
What is it with you bloody men?
We're not just here...

1095
01:20:29,549 --> 01:20:31,687
Anna, let me see her. I can...
She's not here

1096
01:20:31,789 --> 01:20:33,217
Where is she?

1097
01:20:33,324 --> 01:20:34,634
What's it to you? I don't know

1098
01:20:35,756 --> 01:20:37,481
Oh shit, shit. Bollocks

1099
01:20:38,189 --> 01:20:39,750
Oh God. You idiot!

1100
01:20:59,309 --> 01:21:00,738
Clive, you seen Helen?

1101
01:21:00,845 --> 01:21:02,569
No. Why?

1102
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:33,001
Helen!

1103
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,906
Helen!

1104
01:21:40,784 --> 01:21:43,600
Helen...
Helen, you've made a mistake

1105
01:21:43,694 --> 01:21:45,801
Oh, I am such an idiot.
Helen, look at me

1106
01:21:45,903 --> 01:21:46,833
Listen to me, please

1107
01:21:46,929 --> 01:21:51,207
No, you listen!
I never want to see you again

1108
01:21:52,016 --> 01:21:54,735
I have been throught enough
for one year

1109
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:58,826
I stupidly believed that here was
a man who was different from 'men '

1110
01:21:58,929 --> 01:22:01,418
But it is clear
that I made a mistake

1111
01:22:02,033 --> 01:22:05,646
Now please...
do me a favour and go away!

1112
01:22:06,577 --> 01:22:09,261
I am married, Helen,
but I am separated

1113
01:22:09,362 --> 01:22:11,599
Walk away if you want
but take this with you

1114
01:22:11,697 --> 01:22:15,015
The woman you saw today was
the woman I married three years ago

1115
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:18,090
We separated six months ago
and soon we'll be divorced

1116
01:22:19,794 --> 01:22:21,649
Nothing aggressive

1117
01:22:21,745 --> 01:22:23,340
I didn't tell you before because...

1118
01:22:24,913 --> 01:22:28,777
...I don't know why, I...
I have wanted to tell you so many times and

1119
01:22:30,003 --> 01:22:33,102
...and now you've found out
another way I wish I had told y ou

1120
01:22:34,962 --> 01:22:37,168
My mother is ill in hospital
as you know...

1121
01:22:37,267 --> 01:22:40,717
...and Claudia agreed to keep up the
pretence that we were okay still for my mum

1122
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:45,070
As a favour.
She's a very decent woman

1123
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,326
Do you have a mum, Helen?

1124
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,543
Ten minutes, Lydia

1125
01:22:54,643 --> 01:22:57,033
And don't ever turn up at
my kitchen window again like that

1126
01:22:58,037 --> 01:23:00,492
It's over. You know?
You said it yourself

1127
01:23:00,595 --> 01:23:02,800
I know. Sorry, I wasn't thinking

1128
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,527
I just want to show you something

1129
01:23:12,693 --> 01:23:13,620
Oh, Helen...

1130
01:23:14,581 --> 01:23:17,004
if we are not gonna be together then let's
make sure it's for the right reason

1131
01:23:17,108 --> 01:23:19,762
And right now
there is no reason, none

1132
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:22,861
there is just confusion and
it can be erased in a split second

1133
01:23:26,614 --> 01:23:27,923
Get that, would you?

1134
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,955
Of course, if you don't
want to keep it, darling...

1135
01:23:44,821 --> 01:23:46,131
Who is it?

1136
01:23:46,742 --> 01:23:49,165
Oh, hello again.
You're right on time

1137
01:23:52,087 --> 01:23:53,844
Is this the truth, James?

1138
01:24:05,686 --> 01:24:07,662
Permission to engage
the enemy, sir?

1139
01:24:13,656 --> 01:24:16,114
Thing is, I can't take
the interview just now

1140
01:24:16,216 --> 01:24:19,447
I'm discussing whether or not I'm
going to keep your boyfriend's baby

1141
01:24:22,615 --> 01:24:23,696
James...

1142
01:24:24,954 --> 01:24:26,612
...there's something
I have to tell you

1143
01:24:27,225 --> 01:24:29,496
I'm so sorry you had to
hear it this way, Helen

1144
01:24:32,888 --> 01:24:35,539
Er, I really should just phone
Anna and tell her I'm okay

1145
01:24:38,393 --> 01:24:39,670
Helen

1146
01:24:41,593 --> 01:24:43,001
I love you

1147
01:24:43,289 --> 01:24:44,696
Helen, wait, please. Wait!

1148
01:24:45,209 --> 01:24:46,158
Let me go!

1149
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:47,477
Helen!
Helen!

1150
01:25:42,908 --> 01:25:45,298
James... are you her husband?

1151
01:25:47,164 --> 01:25:49,304
Er... I will be.
We're, we're getting married

1152
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,829
If I could have a quick word?

1153
01:25:54,014 --> 01:25:56,829
Helen has suffered major
internal injuries, James

1154
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:00,565
Helen has lost her baby,
I'm afraid, Gerry

1155
01:26:01,887 --> 01:26:03,830
I'm afraid she's lost her baby

1156
01:26:05,438 --> 01:26:07,096
You did know she was pregnant?

1157
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,037
Did you know she was pregnant?

1158
01:26:14,334 --> 01:26:16,091
She will be okay though, won't she?

1159
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,419
She is, she is going to wake up,
isn't she, Doctor?

1160
01:27:09,122 --> 01:27:12,538
Helen, for some reason
I know you can hear me

1161
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:19,264
I'm glad we got things
sorted out... tonight

1162
01:27:34,401 --> 01:27:37,021
I'm glad you caught
the train that day

1163
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:54,591
I am going to make you so happy

1164
01:27:58,467 --> 01:27:59,896
I promise

1165
01:28:10,468 --> 01:28:11,612
Helen?

1166
01:28:14,084 --> 01:28:15,579
Helen!

1167
01:28:18,821 --> 01:28:20,228
Helen!

1168
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,005
Can you hear me?

1169
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:54,434
Can you hear me, Helen?

1170
01:29:22,342 --> 01:29:24,035
I'm sorry I'm late
Ah, no problem

1171
01:29:24,136 --> 01:29:27,106
I'm pleased to say your mother's showing
some signs of improvement this morning

1172
01:29:27,209 --> 01:29:29,248
She's sitting up
and she's had a full breakfast

1173
01:29:29,352 --> 01:29:30,563
That's great

1174
01:29:50,856 --> 01:29:52,287
Helen, I swear...

1175
01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:00,359
I'll do anything you want, Helen

1176
01:30:01,803 --> 01:30:03,046
Will you?

1177
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:07,272
In that case,
I want you to stand up...

1178
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:09,990
...walk over to the door...

1179
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:12,710
...open it... walk through it...

1180
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:15,271
...then close it behind you

1181
01:30:30,957 --> 01:30:32,069
Ta-ta, mum

1182
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:40,391
Call us if you have
any problems at all

1183
01:30:40,492 --> 01:30:41,322
Thank you

1184

Thank you

1187
01:31:36,814 --> 01:31:38,222
Thank you

1188
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:41,189
