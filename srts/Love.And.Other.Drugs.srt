1
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:42,903
Oh, yeah! Yeah, you want to dance?

2
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,102
You don't mind if I get up in there, do you?

3
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:49,813
- This is kind of sexy.
- Yeah. Love it!

4
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:51,349
You're kind of sexy.

5
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,511
You should take one of these.
Very lightweight on your shoulders, ladies.

6
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,079
Try it out, try it out. There you go.
Feels good, yeah?

7
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,292
Here.

8
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:06,422
Follow me, ladies.
Follow me to the cash register.

9
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,833
I see you guys.
You guys look like you smoke weed, right?

10
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,096
Okay, you're gonna smoke a bowl,
you're gonna buy one of these TVs.

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,161
Philips, all right.
You know, you're kind of high, feels good.

12
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,968
Samsung, kind of last year.

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,667
Magnavox, bam!

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,267
That's an explosion!
You're stoned, it'll blow your mind!

15
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,210
You want to go really small, I got this one.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,306
Really small. Look at this flip-phone. Look.

17
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:26,751
"Hello, Joan. What are you doing?"

18
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,720
- "I don't know. What are you doing?"
- "I'm great. "

19
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,865
- You are so bad.
- Guys? Christy.

20
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:42,727
Hey.

21
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,971
Said one, two princes kneel before you

22
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,566
That's what I said now

23
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:55,005
Here, take my card. Take my card.

24
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,208
Take my card. Okay? Take my card.

25
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:05,824
Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

26
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,917
In the house. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

27
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:12,696
Oh. Sorry, Joan.

28
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,667
Okay, squeeze the nipple.
Squeeze the nipple. Harder.

29
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,233
Okay. Oh, my God!

30
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,875
- What are you doing?
- Feel that.

31
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,975
We can't do this. Jerry's right out there.

32
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,040
He can watch.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,215
What makes you so damn sexy?

34
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,681
Oh, my God.

35
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:43,919
I promise you, man,

36
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,624
80 watts is more than
you'll ever need for a living room.

37
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,665
Excuse me.

38
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:54,038
- Hello?
Oh, Jesus. Harder.

39
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,771
- Okay. Oh!
- What the...

40
00:02:58,377 --> 00:02:59,935
You fucking piece of shit!

41
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,411
You fucked up son of a bitch!

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,641
Christy! What the hell is wrong with you?

43
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,014
- How can I ever trust you again?
I don't know. I'm so sorry.

44
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,382
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- No, I...

45
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,047
You know, Fujitsu makes the same unit
for 40 bucks less.

46
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,215
- Really?
- Yeah, but they don't sell it here.

47
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:16,593
But I could get it for you, if you want.

48
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:17,822
Oh! Are you, like, okay?

49
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,166
- Yeah.
- Okay.

50
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:23,724
Give me your number.
I'll let you know when I have it.

51
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,699
- What's your name?
- Amber.

52
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:28,535
- You have beautiful eyes.
Shut the fuck up, Christy!

53
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,232
You.

54
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,001
Don't you ever fucking come in here again!

55
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:36,070
You know what? You owe me commission
on $54,000 worth of second-rate,

56
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:39,914
knock-off, gray-market, off-brand,
overpriced equipment, you son of a bitch.

57
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,976
I'll fucking kill you, you piece of shit!

58
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:43,248
You know what?
Why don't you just send it to me?

59
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:44,346
Christy knows the address.

60
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:47,791
Amber! 434-6603!

61
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,291
Why don't you tell Daddy

62
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:55,560
what a downtown Chicago hospital
is really like?

63
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:59,434
Patient brought in with chills,
nausea, ischemia, clearly in shock.

64
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,767
Did you do a CBC?

65
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,933
Excuse me, our protocols didn't
exist when you went to medical school.

66
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,342
Oh! Yes, I've been under a rock
these past 30 years.

67
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,280
How many transdermal intubations
have you personally done?

68
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,479
My dear, I teach medicine. I no longer
sully my hands touching actual patients.

69
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,144
- Ha!
- Touch patients?

70
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,813
Why would anybody want to do that?

71
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,881
You are not allowed in this conversation.

72
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,153
Excuse me. I've helped more patients
than you ever will.

73
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,558
Can I pour this drink on your head?

74
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,426
What is wrong with getting rich?

75
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,465
God only knows you can't do that
in medicine anymore.

76
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,400
- He's right about that!
- Don't help him justify his laziness.

77
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,630
I already justified my laziness.

78
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:36,003
It's called $35 million on my first IPO.

79
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,564
Jamie, help me.

80
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:41,079
- He's a geek who got lucky.
- And he'll always be a geek.

81
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,080
Yeah? Well, this geek
is taking back your shares.

82
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:44,206
I don't blame you.

83
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,308
The profession was ruined
when they let women in.

84
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,409
I'm killing both of you.

85
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:50,922
I'm killing all of you
if you don't get in there and sit down.

86
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,549
And we get to keep all the shares.

87
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,987
- Ugh!
All right.

88
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,494
Jamie!

89
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,192
Of course, it really happened.

90
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,235
Who wants to see
a movie about protesting?

91
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,930
Whatever.

92
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,529
To the sale of Josh's company!

93
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,575
- Whatever the hell it does.
- Yes!

94
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:13,469
Long live medical software.

95
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,808
And med school dropouts everywhere.

96
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,143
You'd better give
some of this money away,

97
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,649
- that's all I have to say.
- Not gonna happen.

98
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,241
Jamie, what are you up to these days?

99
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,278
- Jamie's selling high-end stereo equipment.
- Ha!

100
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,316
Not anymore.

101
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:30,186
What do you mean?

102
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:33,595
Well, let's just say Jamie had
a falling out with management.

103
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,231
I thought you were in real estate.

104
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:42,330
I am looking for other opportunities.

105
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:46,207
We're living through the greatest creation
of wealth in modern history,

106
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:47,540
and my brother decides to quit.

107
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,917
Josh has been talking to me
about pharmaceutical sales.

108
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,283
Pharmaceutical sales?

109
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,343
Pharmaceutical sales.

110
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:59,185
You know, medicine that's
supposed to help people get better.

111
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,749
Remember Timmy,
my roommate from Brown?

112
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,886
He's a VP at Pfizer. So I said to Jamie,

113
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,760
"Jamie, if you suck on my cock,
I'll get you an interview. "

114
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,026
- Oh, Josh, watch your mouth!
- Watch your mouth!

115
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,500
I said no, Mom. I said no.

116
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,830
Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?

117
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,636
"Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?"

118
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,269
Because it's the only entry-level job in
America that pays over 100 grand a year.

119
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,369
- That's why.
No.

120
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,210
Those people come into our office
with their roller bags and samples,

121
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,477
like door-to-door-salesmen.

122
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,950
They are door-to-door-salesmen,

123
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,453
only what they're selling
grosses $87 billion a year!

124
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,352
Yeah, and they're turning
complex medical decisions

125
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,685
- into Madison Avenue impulse buying.
- Oh, my God.

126
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:34,123
Look, I'm not selling to the patients, okay?

127
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,683
No. No, the patients just see
the commercials on TV...

128
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,921
I'm not even doing the job yet!

129
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,622
...and demand their name-brand drugs
from the doctors...

130
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,222
Calm down, you're freaking out.
- ... and there you are to supply them.

131
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,289
This is so crazy

132
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,925
that you're yelling at me for nothing!
I'm not doing it!

133
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:49,372
If you barbarians won't be still
and finish this lamb,

134
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:53,075
none of you will get the chocolate cake.

135
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,442
Yes, Mom!

136
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:05,855
Oh, Jamie,
if you could make money fucking,

137
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:08,051
you'd be even richer than me.

138
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,689
I'll call the Pfizer guy in the morning.

139
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,064
Let's welcome the class of 1997 trainees!

140
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:31,683
This is not a pill. This is tens
of millions of dollars in research.

141
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:35,418
This is thousands of hours of hard labor.

142
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:38,479
This, ladies and gentlemen, is software.

143
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,481
Your training will last six weeks.

144
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:44,461
Each of you will leave here
a fully qualified health care professional.

145
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,793
That's 33% fewer phone calls
for you at 4:00 a. m.

146
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:49,265
That's 33% less angry... Shit!

147
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,536
Your job will be to go fight illness.

148
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,575
Hello... Fuck!

149
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,308
Shit!

150
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,779
Ah! Fuck! Ah! Shit! Ow!

151
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,352
Off-label uses are benefits
not yet recognized by the FDA.

152
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:16,855
But you can boost sales
by hinting at what these uses are.

153
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,486
Hello, Doctor.
Do you know that prescribing Zithromax...

154
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:20,155
Prescribing Zithromax...

155
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,831
Bonjour, Doctor!

156
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,994
Prescribing Zithromax... Zithromax.

157
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,162
Ah!

158
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,171
Zoloft, a drug approved solely
for the treatment of depression.

159
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:34,235
Off-label uses: alcoholism, bulimia, PMS,

160
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,440
smoking, social anxiety.

161
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,142
Is there a question?

162
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,819
Zoloft has been associated
with suicidal ideation in teenagers.

163
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,914
Unproven.

164
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:47,185
Proven. Unreported.

165
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,493
Your job will be to
go share this technology.

166
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:56,027
Your job will be to go save lives.

167
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,762
The health care industry today
is worth $2 trillion a year.

168
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,597
The top 10 pharma companies
make more money

169
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:07,634
than all 490 of the other
Fortune 500 companies combined.

170
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,149
- What family is Feldene a part of?
- Non-steroidal...

171
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:14,117
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.
An NSAID.

172
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:20,521
A better world, that's why we're here.

173
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,059
Lipitor in Palm Beach!

174
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,061
Xanax, New England!

175
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,823
What about you, Jamie-bamie?

176
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,926
Zoloft and Zithromax
in the Ohio River Valley.

177
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,233
Welcome to Pfizer!

178
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,517
What are you thinking about?

179
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,849
Money.

180
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,482
Pay attention.

181
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,325
We are not going door-to-door selling
oatmeal cookies for the Girl Scouts here.

182
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,264
You are not the goddamn Avon lady.
You understand what I'm saying?

183
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,331
This is hardcore sales,
and you have a quota.

184
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,929
And people at the home office
keeping track of that quota.

185
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,440
And your cold calls, and your mileage,
and your receipts.

186
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,136
How often you goddamn masturbate.

187
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,609
What is the quota for masturbation?

188
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:17,543
You can masturbate
as much as you like, smartass,

189
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,981
as long as you make a lot of money.

190
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,210
Okay.

191
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:22,849
Voila!
Okay, now, remember.

192
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,821
Hospitals have a no-reps policy.

193
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,451
Doesn't mean we can't give the docs
a nice, dry walk from their cars.

194
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,525
All right?

195
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:32,054
There he is. All right.

196
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,188
No time like the present.

197
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,562
- Get your head in the game.
- All right.

198
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,225
- Remember, Pfizer makes his life better.
- Okay.

199
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,166
Pfizer makes his patients happier,

200
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,703
- so he makes more money.
- Okay.

201
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:41,966
- Wait, the pens, the pens!
- Oh, the pens!

202
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,029
Always lead with a pen.

203
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,570
Gifts establish reciprocity!

204
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:48,768
Doctor!

205
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,414
Hey, Doctor, Jamie Randall. Pfizer.
How are you doing?

206
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,280
- No, thank you.
- Look... It's wet out here.

207
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,012
I don't want you compromising
your immune system.

208
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:56,212
Let's talk about Zithromax for a second.

209
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,721
Which part of "No, thank you"
do you not understand?

210
00:10:57,789 --> 00:10:58,915
- You wanna take a pen?
- No, thank you.

211
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,184
Okay.

212
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,687
That's 33% fewer phone calls for you
at 4:00 a. m.

213
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:06,753
Please stop, okay?

214
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,265
That's why I wanna talk to you
about Zithromax, okay?

215
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,392
We are throwing antibiotics at people
the minute they sneeze,

216
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,493
and it doesn't work on viruses anyway.

217
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,764
- What's your name?
- Goldstein.

218
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,897
Right. Dr. Goldstein,
okay, what we're doing...

219
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,140
No, what you're doing is creating
classes of drug-resistant superbugs.

220
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,700
And that might be good for business,

221
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:22,212
because you will develop
stronger antibiotics

222
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,975
and ruin people's
immune systems altogether.

223
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,676
- No... You...
- Thank you.

224
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,829
Models. Beauty queens.

225
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,999
Equestrian princesses. Shit.

226
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,296
You know what I heard?
They're even starting to hire strippers.

227
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,802
I heard that.

228
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,205
Hey, Lisa!

229
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:01,116
- Her name's not Lisa.
- I know. I know.

230
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,177
But if every time I say, "Hey, Lisa,"

231
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,450
then eventually she'll come up to me
and she'll be like, you know,

232
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:10,120
"My name's not Lisa, it's Jennifer,"
or whatever, and I'll do a big apology

233
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:14,495
and I'll say, "I thought you were the Lisa
who was mad at me for not calling. "

234
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:17,091
And from then on, Jennifer,
or whatever her name is,

235
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:20,467
will think that I dated a girl
who looked just like her, who I rejected.

236
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,769
She'll develop this unconscious need
to win my approval,

237
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:25,071
and from then on, it's cake.

238
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:28,476
Damn!

239
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:33,310
Accepted etiquette is one rep at a time.
Screw etiquette.

240
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,912
Competing reps are not your friends.
Okay, Knight.

241
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,512
- Where you going?
- Oh. Sorry.

242
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,353
Knight is a doc you gotta close.

243
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,756
Leads the largest group in the city.

244
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,818
Lots of fucked-up college students
on Prozac who should be on Zoloft.

245
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,124
You always bring donuts?

246
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,960
Pharma sales is a lot like dating.

247
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,934
They want you to take them to dinner
and pretend to expect nothing in return.

248
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:53,300
- And no one ever got laid by going Dutch.
- Exactly.

249
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,633
Gail, good morning!
How are you this fine day?

250
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,442
Sick people touch those.

251
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,217
When I order a second test,
it's for a reason, God damn it.

252
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,686
Unbelievable!

253
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:16,420
That's him. Another time.

254
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,761
If they don't take us in five minutes,
we leave. Only losers wait.

255
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,028
There he is.

256
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,467
Hey there, beautiful. How you doing?

257
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:27,934
Get over here, Trey.

258
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,974
Two tickets to La Bohème on the 19th.

259
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,034
I hate you. Can't you go with me
instead of my husband?

260
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:38,674
Trey Hannigan. Lilly's Prozac rep,
top 10 nationally. The Devil.

261
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,741
He's on the phone with Watson.
You can go on back.

262
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,253
He's the reason
we never make our quota on Zoloft.

263
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:48,555
- Is he going in?
- What a dick!

264
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,358
If we can show 5% gains monthly,
we're going to the promised land.

265
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,825
The promised land?

266
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,366
Chicago.

267
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:58,527
Civilization. Culture.

268
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:01,504
And not incidentally, my wife and kids.

269
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,700
Only the great and near-great get Chicago,

270
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,471
but I got a hunch
that you and your swinging dick

271
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,205
might be my ticket to the big leagues.

272
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,549
Good morning.

273
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,219
Doctor only sees new reps
who bring a lunch.

274
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,921
Here's a list of available dates.

275
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:26,827
- The first one is in five weeks.
- Great.

276
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:30,857
Here's a list of approved foods,
no sushi, no salads.

277
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:32,129
No salads.

278
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,330
Leave your samples with me.

279
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,835
- Hi.
- Five weeks.

280
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,634
You're going to like me.

281
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,702
I beg your pardon?

282
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,407
Sooner or later, everybody does.
You wanna know why?

283
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:46,883
'Cause I'll do whatever it takes
to make that happen. I'm very trainable.

284
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:49,681
- What's your name?
- Gail. Five weeks.

285
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,153
Oh, Gail, that's not fair.

286
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:52,519
I'm laying myself bare here.

287
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,526
I'm revealing my true vulnerability.
And now you're stonewalling me.

288
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:58,351
Is that fair?

289
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:01,165
- That's not fair.
- You stay out of this.

290
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,826
Look at you angels of mercy! How do
the docs get any work done around here?

291
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,233
Fine. What do you want?

292
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:08,762
I just want you to let me leave my samples
where he'll see them.

293
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,104
'Cause otherwise, you're gonna
throw them away after I leave.

294
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,714
Gail. No sushi, no salads.

295
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,322
Who let you back here?

296
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,694
Oh! Dr. Knight! Do you know that
prescribing Zithromax for ear infections,

297
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,828
- diarrhea and...
- Cindy! Can you deal with this, please?

298
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,304
How about a pen?
Do you want a pen?

299
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,748
- Okay, Prince Charming, time's up.
- Oh! Okay.

300
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,289
Wow! That is a long handle!

301
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:05,954
- Would you like a pen?
- Thanks.

302
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,054
Purple.

303
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,497
- Bye.
- Bye.

304
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:31,714
Uh,

305
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,315
I got something for you today.

306
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:38,055
Wait, I think... Yup.
There's another one for you, too!

307
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:44,998
The thing about these pens is that
they have tiny little point tips on them,

308
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:47,469
and then I end up pressing too hard, and...

309
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,200
Hello, gorgeous.

310
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:52,306
Jamie! Jamie, they're beautiful!

311
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,818
Hey, Lisa!

312
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:15,361
Okay, this may have worked for you
in the past, but let me lay it out.

313
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:19,300
I became a rep for one reason, doctors.

314
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:24,204
To meet doctors, fraternize with doctors,
breed with doctors.

315
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,779
So next time you see me in the field,
don't ask for a handout.

316
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,678
It's just awkward.

317
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:37,613
I want Chicago, Randall. And right now,
you're not making it happen!

318
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,955
You're 20% below your quota for Z,
you're 45% below your quota for Zoloft!

319
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:44,127
You want me off your ass, you punk?

320
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:46,060
There's your answer.

321
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:50,733
He's got toddlers taking Prozac.
He's got dogs taking Prozac.

322
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,703
He'd have rocks taking Prozac
if they paid cash.

323
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:56,365
And by the way, you want
one doctor to start writing Zoloft?

324
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:57,499
It's the guy standing next to him.

325
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,343
Knight?
Knight.

326
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,139
Hannigan's butt buddy.

327
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:04,409
But I swear, he starts writing it,
the rest of the docs will follow.

328
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:06,006
And Windy City, here we come.

329
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,352
- Dr. Knight.
- Hey, I'm very late.

330
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,584
- One thousand dollars.
- Excuse me?

331
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,492
- It's a check for $1,000.
- For what?

332
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,085
For a special Pfizer preceptorship.

333
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:22,189
For me to shadow you, learn your practice,
and better serve the needs of doctors.

334
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,460
Are you bribing me?

335
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,730
No, Doctor, no.

336
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:30,706
It's a special Pfizer preceptorship
for me to shadow you.

337
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:33,367
Is this a joke?

338
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:36,277
If you think $1,000 is a joke.

339
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,348
That's 33% fewer phone calls at 4:00 a. m...

340
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:43,943
I'd write a lot more of your scrip
if I were a regularly paid consultant.

341
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,922
Well, you know,
we can talk to them about that.

342
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,049
They spend $5 billion a year
on marketing, right?

343
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,115
Mmm-hmm.

344
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,388
Instead of flying me to Cancún
and making me sit through

345
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,260
some bullshit, nonsense,
peer-to-peer conference,

346
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,061
just give me half that money in cash.

347
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,226
- Yeah, but Cancún...
- Dr. Knight,

348
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,394
- Mrs. Putney's on the phone. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

349
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,903
Her daughter has to sing on Friday.
They're doing Bye Bye Birdie,

350
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:04,271
and she's playing Kim, and she wondered
if you could call in an antibiotic?

351
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,469
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay, thanks.

352
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:07,602
Hey.

353
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,874
This can't be right. Janice? Janice?

354
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,246
A 26-year-old needs
Parkinson's medication?

355
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,683
- Beth wrote that one up.
- Hi.

356
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:19,054
All right, look, if a patient asks,
you're an intern, okay?

357
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,284
Yeah. Can I take notes?

358
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,020
- Sure. Why not?
- All right.

359
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,058
Hey. I'm Dr. Knight.

360
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,961
- Maggie Murdock.
- Hi.

361
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:32,800
- So your file says, "Kind of an emergency. "
- Yeah.

362
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,339
My apartment was burgled yesterday,
and they took my Parkinson's meds.

363
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,971
But my symptoms are pretty good today,
so it's "kind of an emergency. "

364
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:45,013
I know your Lilly rep, Trey Hannigan?
He asked Cindy to squeeze me in, so...

365
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,448
Yeah, Trey's a great guy.

366
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,576
Oh. Well, I wouldn't say that.

367
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,315
So, monotherapy?

368
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:56,292
Yep. Sinemet CR, 50 milligrams,
two times a day,

369
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,592
plus Domperidone to cut the nausea,
10 milligrams, three times a day.

370
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:03,430
Artane for the tremor, two milligrams,
a whole tablet, three times a day.

371
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,128
And Prozac, so that I'm not too bummed

372
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,967
about having
a major degenerative disorder at 26.

373
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,939
Forty milligrams, once, in the morning.

374
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,840
Zoloft has fewer side effects.

375
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,638
I'm sorry, who are you?

376
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,439
Jamie Randall.

377
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,073
Oh.

378
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:19,271
Hi.

379
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,674
Intern.

380
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:27,213
So, early-onset Parkinson's.
That's pretty rare.

381
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,159
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First they thought it was
essential tremor, then Wilson's disease,

382
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:36,496
then Huntington's.
Then, they tested for MAS, PSP, syphilis.

383
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,803
I was very glad for a negative on that one.

384
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,704
I didn't really relish the thought
of feeling like a 19th century slut.

385
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,601
Let's see. Then, there was
brain tumor week, which was very scary.

386
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,579
And then six months
chasing obscure dystonias,

387
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:53,242
but, no, it just turned out to be
good, old-fashioned Parkinson's.

388
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,115
Right. And... Don't you have a neurologist?

389
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,753
We broke up.

390
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:03,253
And do you have insurance?

391
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,420
Do I have insurance.

392
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,022
Okay.

393
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,163
Well, sure. Why not?

394
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:13,965
- Great.
- Is there anything else I can do for you?

395
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:15,027
Nope. Oh!

396
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,162
Um...

397
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:18,704
Actually, yeah.

398
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:22,803
I have a weird blotch on my breast.

399
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,110
I don't know,
I'm trying not to freak out about it.

400
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,708
- Well, let's have a look.
- Great.

401
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:32,815
Here you go. Do you see that?

402
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,787
- That's a spider bite.
- Is it?

403
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,489
Yeah, that's a spider bite.

404
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,792
Great!

405
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,123
All right.

406
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,125
- There you are.
- Thank you, Dr. Knight.

407
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,226
Sure.

408
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:47,698
You're welcome.

409
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:56,373
- You're a drug rep?
- Wait...

410
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,382
You let me take my shirt off,
you fucking creep!

411
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,479
Wait, wait, wait. I'm hurt.

412
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,577
- Your buckle just hit my eye.
- No, it didn't.

413
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:05,246
- I'm hurt. I'm hurt.
- Oh, my God.

414
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,813
Who said I was a drug rep?

415
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,483
Excuse me, look at your bag!

416
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,427
I don't think
you're going to the fucking airport.

417
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,555
Okay, look, just apologize, okay?
Just apologize.

418
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:14,655
Would you do that just once?

419
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,792
I would actually like to hear someone from
the medical community actually apologize!

420
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,269
Okay. Okay, I apologize.

421
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:26,277
I apologize on behalf of all the arrogant,
faceless, cut-off, asshole doctors out there

422
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:30,474
who've treated you like a non-person
while peeking at your breasts.

423
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,109
So what's your name?

424
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:36,610
You're good.

425
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:40,520
Strong eye contact. Implied intimacy.
You'll make your quotas.

426
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,922
Let me take you out
for a cup of coffee then.

427
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:45,590
Whoa! What was that for?

428
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,794
Eat shit and die, that's what that was.

429
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:50,561
No, wait, wait! Hold on one second!
I can do a better apology!

430
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:57,906
'Cause I want to know.

431
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:03,572
The same white tights
I wear every single day.

432
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,843
You are out of your mind.

433
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,714
All right, nothing underneath?

434
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,147
- You're bad!
- So,

435
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,553
I need the number of
a patient he saw yesterday.

436
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:19,357
A Murdock, or something like that.

437
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,920
You want Maggie Murdock's number?

438
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:24,661
Yes. Because she mentioned,
like, six neurologists,

439
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:27,795
and Pfizer's coming out
with a new Parkinson's med,

440
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:31,137
and I wanna contact them all,
and I wanna make a lot of money,

441
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,403
Miss None Of Your Business.

442
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:36,078
- We're not supposed to give out numbers.
- What?

443
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,047
You gave me your number, you bad girl.

444
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,276
Do your friends know
how bad you really are?

445
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,519
Jamie!

446
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,054
Because if they knew
how bad you really are...

447
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:50,787
Listen, I promise I'll wear the stethoscope
next time we play naughty nurse.

448
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,631
546-2312.

449
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,034
Okay, I got to go. Thanks, bye.

450
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:06,700
What are you doing here?

451
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,611
I'm all fucked up!

452
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,843
- Farrah kicked me out.
- No way.

453
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,712
Can you believe that? I think she's fucking
somebody already, I swear to God!

454
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,723
- Why did she kick you out?
- I don't know, Jamie!

455
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,419
- Jesus!
- She said I was addicted to Internet porn.

456
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,257
- Are you?
- Of course I am!

457
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:26,956
Fuck! Isn't everybody?

458
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:28,999
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

459
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,201
I can't breathe.

460
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,397
I'm having a panic attack.

461
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:37,566
- Do you have any Ativan?
- We're Xanax.

462
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,202
Fine, Xanax!
You have any samples of Xanax?

463
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:44,112
Jamie, I'm in a really vulnerable place
right now.

464
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,776
Okay. Okay.

465
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:51,619
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

466
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,486
Come here, come here, come here.
It's okay.

467
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,388
Dude! Dude!

468
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,952
We're not huggers.

469
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,626
Faster. Come on! We got this!

470
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:07,728
- Josh, will you turn that down?
- Oh. No.

471
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:09,403
Josh!

472
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,207
- Hello?
- Why did you take that picture?

473
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:20,948
Is that the girl with the tits?

474
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:23,984
How'd you get my number?

475
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,056
What, you called Knight's office?

476
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:31,854
- How'd you get my number?
- From the receptionist.

477
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,488
Who you're fucking.

478
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,858
What'd she say?

479
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,460
Have coffee with me.

480
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,566
- Why?
- Because I'm a drug rep.

481
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:41,832
I'm not a creep.

482
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:45,598
Same thing.

483
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:49,908
Look, I'm sorry that I stared at your tits,
but they're really nice.

484
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,742
Hello?

485
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,180
Yes. Yes.

486
00:25:57,788 --> 00:25:59,722
Oh, I thought you hung up for a second.

487
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,383
Should I have?

488
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:04,060
What, and miss the opportunity
of insulting me?

489
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,661
Oh, you like being insulted?

490
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,324
Hold on a second.

491
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:13,292
Ow!

492
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:15,227
Um...

493
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:16,998
By the right person.

494
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:20,840
Oh, my God. This is a sales call, isn't it?

495
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:24,438
You're gonna stay on the phone with me
until I say yes, aren't you?

496
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:26,380
Well, I take my work very seriously.

497
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,320
5:00, Lulu's on Clark.

498
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,389
All right. Bye.

499
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:38,517
Ow!

500
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,097
Why is your answer
to everything violence?

501
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:46,397
I said 5:00.

502
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,434
- Very cute.
- Oh! Please, you can have him.

503
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,842
Khaki pants? No, thanks.

504
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,380
So... What's your name?

505
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:03,377
Jamie Randall.

506
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:06,287
Jamie, right. Okay, sorry.
What's your game?

507
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,182
My game?

508
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,124
I'm sorry, right, this is
the part where we talk about

509
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:12,628
where we come from
and what we majored in, in college.

510
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:14,129
You have beautiful eyes.

511
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,233
That's it? That's the best you got?

512
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:18,598
I'm serious. They're beautiful.

513
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,572
Well, thank you. Let's see, what else?
My childhood? When did I get sick?

514
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,801
So, are you always this mean?

515
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,740
Actually, this is me being nice.

516
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:32,909
So, how's your quota this month?

517
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:34,507
Have you had
your first performance review?

518
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:35,916
Is that a resting tremor?

519
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:37,846
Comes and goes?

520
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,550
It's none of your business.

521
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:42,823
Happens when you're nervous.

522
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,426
Mr. Expert, why would I be nervous?

523
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,430
- 'Cause you're interested.
- And that would make me nervous?

524
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:50,729
Yeah, your mind's telling you one thing,
your body's telling you something else.

525
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,364
You left me standing

526
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,135
Let's go.

527
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:00,901
Excuse me?

528
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:03,242
You wanna close, right?
You wanna get laid?

529
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,508
Now?

530
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:11,478
Mmm. Oh, right, right, right. I'm supposed
to act like I don't know if it's right,

531
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:15,514
so then you tell me that there is no right
or wrong, there's just the moment.

532
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:21,028
And then I tell you that I can't,
while actually signaling to you that I can,

533
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:23,157
which you don't need,
because you're not really listening,

534
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,829
because this isn't about connection
for you, this isn't even about sex for you.

535
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:30,897
This is about finding an hour or two
of relief from the pain of being you.

536
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,408
And that's fine with me, see,

537
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:35,639
because all I want is the exact same thing.

538
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,244
You left me standing

539
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:43,115
in the doorway crying

540
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:47,217
Does that mean I don't have to leave a tip?

541
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:18,352
And now you're thinking,
"Will I stay five minutes or ten?"

542
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,890
And, "Where did I throw my pager?"

543
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,289
Mmm.

544
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,919
I'm not thinking that. It's under the table.

545
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,163
You're probably thinking,
"What's this guy's name again?"

546
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,431
Bye, Johnny.

547
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,570
I think it's time for you to go.

548
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:45,137
Whoa, whoa, I don't need to go.

549
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:47,683
Well, I need you to go.

550
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,284
Oh, okay.

551
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,552
It was nice meeting you.

552
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,993
It was nice meeting you, too.
Maybe we'll...

553
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:08,127
We'll see each other around.
I'll just leave the key there.

554
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,536
Thanks.

555
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,872
'Cause he gets up in the morning

556
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:18,479
And he goes to work at 9:00

557
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,975
And he comes back home at 5:30

558
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,953
Gets the same train every time

559
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:28,753
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality

560
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,817
It never fails

561
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:33,590
And he's oh, so good

562
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:36,762
And he's oh, so fine

563
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,268
And he's oh, so healthy

564
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:42,430
In his body and his mind

565
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:45,907
He's a well respected man about town

566
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:50,345
Doing the best things so conservatively

567
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,617
And his mother goes to meetings

568
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:00,489
And she stirs the tea with councilors

569
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:01,546
While discussing foreign trade

570
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:04,956
What?

571
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,058
Wait! Wait.

572
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,368
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

573
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:16,137
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

574
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,174
I know it's so late.

575
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:19,798
Oh, my God!

576
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:21,435
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

577
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,604
Oh, my God!

578
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,181
I didn't see anything! My glasses are off!

579
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,341
Josh, turn around!

580
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,713
Hi. Josh. Pleasure to meet you.

581
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:40,728
I can recite
the six causes of pernicious anemia

582
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,790
and the four stages of terminal cirrhosis.

583
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:48,702
And by fourth grade, I knew what
a distended ileum felt like on palpation.

584
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
So why did you bail on med school?

585
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,369
I didn't bail. I just couldn't finish college.
I couldn't sit through a class.

586
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,444
Oh. Ritalin at 10.

587
00:31:58,248 --> 00:31:59,442
Eight.

588
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:01,548
Show-off.

589
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,084
But you were really smart?

590
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:08,591
Yeah. The prodigal son, with ADD.

591
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,825
You want to know the truth?

592
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:12,250
Hmm?

593
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,327
I just couldn't give my father
the satisfaction.

594
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,230
Does this generally work for you?

595
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:24,501
What?

596
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:31,012
This. The whole misunderstood-by-Dad-
I'm-a-vulnerable-guy thing.

597
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,184
Usually. Yeah.

598
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:38,010
Well, it's pretty good.

599
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,253
Thanks.

600
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:44,090
But somewhere along the line,
say, sixth grade,

601
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:48,427
a girl smiled at you,
or a bunch of girls smiled at you,

602
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,791
and, ta-da,
Jamie's good at something after all.

603
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,462
Actually, it was the fifth grade.

604
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:00,499
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

605
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,274
I'm going.

606
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,174
- Why?
- See...

607
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:14,583
The thing is, I really like having sex,

608
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:17,923
and I actually really like
having sex with you,

609
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,396
so let's just keep it simple.

610
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:23,524
I can do that.

611
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,832
Yeah, you do seem like a shithead,

612
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,269
so it should be all right.

613
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,003
There's just alarms going off in my head

614
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:36,307
that you're not entirely what you seem.

615
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,043
Oh, no, no. I'm a shithead, believe me.

616
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,249
Good.

617
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:50,653
Because if you turn out
not to be a shithead, that would be bad.

618
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:58,062
I'm a shithead, believe me.
Through and through.

619
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:20,345
Hey!

620
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,720
Hey, man. How are you?

621
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:28,027
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

622
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:32,095
Damaged cells are releasing
arachidonic acid.

623
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,232
Your body's converting it to prostaglandin,

624
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:36,864
which is triggering a fiesta
of enzymes necessary for pain.

625
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:39,839
Do you wanna throw up?
It's not gonna help.

626
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:42,672
It's gonna take about a minute
for the acid to dissipate

627
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,407
and your natural morphine to kick in.

628
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:47,406
- You know why I hit you?
- No! No!

629
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,549
Prozac has helped millions of people
overcome intractable mood disorders,

630
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,446
making miserable lives livable.

631
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:56,121
It's even helped me
with some of my own anger issues.

632
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,386
So when someone fucks with my Prozac,
it upsets me.

633
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,122
You know what people say about me?

634
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,533
You're in the top ten nationally?

635
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:05,590
Why do you suppose that is?

636
00:35:06,436 --> 00:35:07,767
Fuck you!

637
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:09,664
Why do you suppose that is?

638
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:11,935
Because I'm ex-Marine,

639
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,840
and I'll destroy anyone
who gets in my way.

640
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,900
Right.

641
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:16,534
Shit.

642
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:20,538
Ow!

643
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:22,340
Fuck.

644
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:25,118
I'd ice that as soon as you can.

645
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:28,419
If it hurts in a few days, get an X-ray.

646
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,354
And stay away from Maggie.

647
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:39,466
Excuse me.

648
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:44,404
Are those more samples?

649
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:47,967
Yeah. Help yourself.

650
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:50,806
Thanks.

651
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,372
I got a job interview today.

652
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,483
Oh, that's great. That's great.

653
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,048
That's great.

654
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:05,555
Hello, ladies!

655
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,726
No samples today.

656
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,231
What do you mean?
I got great stuff for you!

657
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,563
No samples today, thank you.

658
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:16,461
She's just a friend.

659
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,973
No samples today. Sorry.

660
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,407
Okay. What's going on?

661
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,039
Trey got to you, didn't he?
What'd he give you?

662
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:26,509
No samples today, thank you. Hawaii.

663
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:29,343
Hawaii?

664
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:33,549
No samples today. Doctor's convention.
Sand and surf in Honolulu.

665
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:36,586
Wow. Okay.

666
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:39,555
Okay.

667
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:47,659
I got to get out of here.

668
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:49,929
You're not going to go see her, are you?

669
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:51,767
No.

670
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,465
Mmm-hmm.

671
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,453
Maggie!

672
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:13,685
Hi.

673
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:15,395
Hey, what's that?

674
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:16,792
Food.

675
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:20,292
- For?
- Eating.

676
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:21,861
They're my noodles!

677
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,269
You already
have a face full of noodles!

678
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,329
Jesus!

679
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:27,303
My God, you are so selfish.
You're just like my mother.

680
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,442
Did you sleep with your mother?

681
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,571
Ew!

682
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,512
- What?
- You know what?

683
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,477
She's cute, she's available, you'd love her.

684
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:38,187
The only thing is, she happens to
take up all the oxygen in the room

685
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,722
and hog all the closet space,
but other than that,

686
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,916
you two are perfect for each other.

687
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:43,551
Is she hotter than you?
I bet she's hotter than you.

688
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,326
She doesn't have a disease, either.

689
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,320
Does that work for you generally?

690
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:49,160
- What?
- Self-pity.

691
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,557
You are a shithead.

692
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,339
What?

693
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:05,345
Nothing.

694
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,851
This is nice.

695
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:21,189
Okay, I think it's time to
take off your clothes and jump me.

696
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:23,789
Wait. Am I not allowed to say that?

697
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,594
I don't know.

698
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:30,197
First you bring food,
and then you wanna spend the night,

699
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:31,297
and then you bring a change of clothes,

700
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:34,138
and then you bring a razor and,
oh, my God, it's a relationship.

701
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,303
I don't want a relationship.

702
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:37,107
Well, you can't guarantee
that now, can you?

703
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,239
You might actually have some kind of

704
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:41,113
latent humanity that
you don't know anything about.

705
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:43,675
You might like being
in a relationship, and...

706
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:46,620
Listen, I said this was nice.
I didn't ask you to marry me.

707
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,420
Well, I wouldn't want to be
with someone who was sick, either.

708
00:38:58,635 --> 00:38:59,966
I'm sorry.

709
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:02,969
- Sorry.
- No.

710
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,531
I just... I did that before, and it didn't...

711
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:09,136
It wasn't good.

712
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:16,651
I'd just been diagnosed,

713
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:18,650
and he was married.

714
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:22,819
He helped me, and it didn't end well. So...

715
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,124
It's Trey Hannigan, isn't it?

716
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,429
- Trey Hannigan? It was Trey Hannigan.
- Yeah, well...

717
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,336
Uh...

718
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:39,200
Are you in love with him?

719
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:44,436
No, I'm not in love with Trey Hannigan.

720
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,607
I was never in love with Trey Hannigan.

721
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:50,013
He was... Said he was in love with me.

722
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:56,756
Which was, you know, a problem.

723
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,400
- Can we just...
- Right, yeah.

724
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:08,936
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

725
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,302
- Please.
- Okay.

726
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:17,312
You get a special thank you
for bringing food.

727
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:18,807
I do?

728
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:20,810
Yes, you do.

729
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,307
Mmm.

730
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,314
- You know what?
- What?

731
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:27,413
What?

732
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:29,255
I got to pee.

733
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:32,852
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

734
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,683
Just give me a second, okay?

735
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:57,842
Okay.

736
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,101
Mmm.

737
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,770
Focus, focus, focus.

738
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:26,537
Should I keep going?

739
00:41:26,716 --> 00:41:28,547
- This never happens.
- I'm aware.

740
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:30,375
I'm serious. It doesn't.

741
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:33,920
No, no, no. Don't worry about it.
It's me. I'm a jinx.

742
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,619
That's really helpful.

743
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,489
You know what? Why don't you
talk about all the other guys

744
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,427
that you slept with that couldn't get it up,
'cause then it would really like...

745
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:41,987
Shh! Shh! Shh!

746
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,224
Just calm down.

747
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:48,628
Just give me a minute.

748
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,063
Don't worry about it.

749
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,302
I am worried about it!

750
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:58,678
Jesus! Can you just please...
Just show me a little kindness?

751
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:01,009
Please.

752
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:06,281
Oh, you lying sack of shit!
You do have latent humanity.

753
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:10,954
- Do you know what's going on here?
- I just want to have sex.

754
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:14,026
Well, your body's telling you otherwise.

755
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,099
What is that supposed to mean?

756
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:20,866
Sit up.

757
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:23,167
- I don't want to sit up.
- Come on. Sit up. Sit up. Sit up. Come on.

758
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:28,300
All right. Now talk to me.

759
00:42:28,778 --> 00:42:30,439
I don't want to talk.

760
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,710
What else are we going to do?
You've taken sex off the table.

761
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:34,909
Oh!

762
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:37,680
Come on. Come on.
Tell me how your day was.

763
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:39,852
- My day?
- Mmm-hmm.

764
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,453
So I sneak up to my room and
I white out the "D" so it looks like a "B,"

765
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:46,756
which I did flawlessly. It was undetectable.

766
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,654
And I go down to his study
and I hand him the paper.

767
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,758
And he gives me the face.

768
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:54,202
And I'm like, "What?"

769
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:56,028
Mmm-hmm.

770
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:59,597
And then, from behind his back,
he pulls out the goddamn carbon copy

771
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:01,667
- that the school sent home.
- Oh, no!

772
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,276
- Yeah.
- Wow.

773
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:06,008
Genius. Genius.

774
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,979
- You're so competitive.
- No!

775
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:14,390
Yeah! Yes, you are. Oh, my God, I tell you

776
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,948
I'm involved with Trey Hannigan
and you can't get it up.

777
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,893
I could give a shit about Trey Hannigan.

778
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:21,663
All you care about is beating him!

779
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:23,824
- Bullshit!
- You know, it's so prehistoric.

780
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,262
All men care about is performance,

781
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:27,963
but they have an appendage
that doesn't work

782
00:43:28,037 --> 00:43:30,437
if they're worried about performance.

783
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,999
Mmm. Well, you're an expert, so...

784
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,245
Okay. If I'm an expert,
then why is your company spending

785
00:43:40,316 --> 00:43:42,443
billions making a drug
so that guys can get it up?

786
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:43,508
Oh, I wish.

787
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:45,516
It's true. I read it.
Pfizer's making a fuck drug.

788
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:47,586
Where'd you read that?

789
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:49,353
I don't know. Ask your guys.

790
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,486
I don't know where I read it.
I'm a drug slut. I read everything.

791
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:54,295
- What drug?
- I don't know,

792
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:55,695
but it's hard to believe, isn't it?

793
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,034
It's hard to believe.

794
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,994
- It's gonna be pretty huge, though.
- Oh!

795
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:06,598
When I think of the size of the problem

796
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:10,175
and that it's growing larger, really...

797
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,111
- Really.
- I can't even imagine!

798
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,410
You know what I think...

799
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:14,848
To have found a solution
to the stiffest, hardest...

800
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:15,907
Wow.

801
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:19,477
- Pfizer must be swelling with pride.
- I'm gonna stop you.

802
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,180
No tickling! Stop!

803
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:23,452
Stop! No tickling! No, please!

804
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:26,188
Don't tickle me just
because you have a limp sense of humor!

805
00:44:26,262 --> 00:44:27,251
Oh!

806
00:44:36,973 --> 00:44:38,167
Hello.

807
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:44,079
Keep talking.

808
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:45,739
No more talking.

809
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:03,363
Who are all these old people?

810
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,900
Uh... Just some people I work with.

811
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:10,838
Wow. These are beautiful.

812
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:13,374
It looks like a photograph.

813
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,210
When did you do this?

814
00:45:16,379 --> 00:45:17,368
Uh...

815
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:21,380
Back when I could hold a brush.

816
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:24,116
Here's your breakfast.

817
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:28,719
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well...

818
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:34,993
I'll call you.

819
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,293
- Don't.
- I will.

820
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:39,857
I'm not kidding.

821
00:45:44,073 --> 00:45:47,008
I can't do this.

822
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:52,138
I told you.

823
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:02,019
Okay, then.

824
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:04,218
See you.

825
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,499
Your problem is
you don't know how to close!

826
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,936
You gotta tell the docs what they need.

827
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:17,233
Somebody says no,
that's when the fun starts.

828
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,296
That means you are in.

829
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:20,706
- My numbers are up.
- Your Zithromax is up. Big deal.

830
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,768
We're not going to Chicago on Zithromax.

831
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:25,109
Depressed people, Randall,
they're depressed every day.

832
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:26,170
You gotta move Zoloft.

833
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:28,843
- I want you to focus on Zoloft.
- Zoloft.

834
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:32,479
Counseling? Here's some counseling.
Stop being a fucking bitch.

835
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:34,284
Wait, did I use "you" language?

836
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:35,415
Trial separation.

837
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:38,358
I'm so sorry. I need to own my feelings.

838
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,452
Fucking pepperoni.

839
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,518
Let me rephrase that.

840
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,657
I feel that you should stop
being a fucking bitch!

841
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:48,134
So, I hear we're coming out
with a new sex drug.

842
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:50,530
- What are you talking about?
- Is it true?

843
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,440
- Where did you hear that?
- Heard it around.

844
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:56,501
Sildenafil citrate. It's a PDE-5 inhibitor.

845
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,070
They lucked into it during trials
for blood pressure medication.

846
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:02,276
Guys had massive boners the whole time.
Where did you hear that?

847
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,944
- What's it called?
- Viagra.

848
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,783
- I want it.
- Everybody wants it.

849
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:06,844
I could sell the shit out of it.

850
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:09,448
Can you see if there's some Tums
in there for me in the glove compartment?

851
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:10,890
- Bruce.
- Tums me, buddy.

852
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,154
Bruce.

853
00:47:12,228 --> 00:47:14,662
Bruce. I want that account.

854
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:16,697
Why would I give it to you?

855
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:19,462
Who can sell a dick drug better than me?

856
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:22,570
Ten years, Jamie,
ten excruciating years of marriage.

857
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,266
It's like the lost decade.

858
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,240
Oh, my God!

859
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:28,607
I don't even know
how to hit on women anymore.

860
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:29,702
What do you do? What's your game?

861
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:31,110
You need an IBS.
Do you know what that is?

862
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,204
Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

863
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:33,270
An Initial Benefit Statement.

864
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:35,579
Tell them who you are, why you're there
and what you can do for them.

865
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:36,641
All right? And just be yourself, Josh.

866
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,311
- You'll be fine.
- Thank you very much.

867
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,522
Oh! Look who just walked in.

868
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,521
Now's your chance, "Closer. "

869
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:44,617
Show me what you got.

870
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,753
Show me.

871
00:47:49,098 --> 00:47:51,623
Hey! Pfizer, how's your fist?

872
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:52,690
How's your jaw?

873
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,865
Randall, you know Stan Knight, right?

874
00:47:55,938 --> 00:47:58,463
Stan, this is a bright young man
from Pfizer.

875
00:47:58,541 --> 00:47:59,735
Yes, we've met.

876
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:00,969
- Yeah. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

877
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,808
New study on Zoloft,
25% fewer side effects than Prozac.

878
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,711
So, I'm feeling good.

879
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,613
You'd do better selling him
if you got him laid.

880
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,015
Can you get me laid?

881
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:12,715
Stan's one of the more respected
diagnosticians in town,

882
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,381
but his real calling is pussy-hound.

883
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:16,516
Yes, and I think your real calling is pimp.

884
00:48:17,026 --> 00:48:19,187
Now, you're banging Maggie Murdock,
aren't you?

885
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:22,021
You are.

886
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:24,658
Oh, God, those tits are unbelievable!

887
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:26,201
- So not fair!
- All right.

888
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:29,761
No, no. You don't see that a lot
in the neurologically damned.

889
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,034
What do you mean, "damned"?
You don't die from Parkinson's.

890
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:33,905
Well, it's not much of a life, now is it?

891
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:35,568
What do you mean? Interferon, L-dopa...

892
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:37,203
It slowed the progress
in the majority of cases.

893
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,577
Listen, Dr. Drug Rep.

894
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:40,980
You know less than shit, okay?
She's a sick girl.

895
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,950
Oh. Is that what you told your wife?

896
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,281
That's none of your fucking business.

897
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:46,014
Maggie has all sorts of needs,

898
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,954
and I don't think a pussy like you
is up for the job.

899
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:49,082
Right, and a married man is?

900
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:50,750
- Whoa, whoa!
- You really want me to hit you again?

901
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:54,129
Chill out, man! Chill.
Wait! Don't get aggressive.

902
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,824
Don't get aggressive. Hey!

903
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,957
Whoa! Baby, okay. It's okay.

904
00:48:58,034 --> 00:48:59,524
Inter-fucking-feron, really?

905
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:00,796
- You know what?
- Hey.

906
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:01,859
Easy, easy.

907
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,565
- I'm going home.
- No, you're not.

908
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:07,234
- No, no, no. I'm going home.
- Good. Say hi to your wife.

909
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,402
I'm keeping my eyes on you, buddy.

910
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:11,775
That freaked me out.

911
00:49:13,182 --> 00:49:15,776
He actually, physically hit you, didn't he?

912
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,013
Yeah, he did, and I was afraid
he was going to do it again.

913
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:20,112
He might have to up his meds,
that young man.

914
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,783
Or maybe he needs to change to
a drug that's proven more effective

915
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,690
in controlling aggressive behavior.

916
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:30,529
Zoloft produced 13% fewer outbursts
in a controlled study of adult males.

917
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,596
And I think it's...

918
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:33,726
Turn to your left.

919
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,600
Turn to your left right now.
Turn to your left.

920
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:37,805
Those two women, I know both of them.

921
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,535
Which one do you want to take home?

922
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:45,705
You're a superstar. Confidence is king.

923
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:50,610
Hey. What do you say we blow this joint,
and then each other?

924
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:52,914
Okay.

925
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:55,054
Thank you.

926
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,922
We ready?

927
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,622
- You okay, champ?
- No.

928
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:06,958
What are you doing? Are you calling her?

929
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,874
Hey, did she go down on you?

930
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:14,432
Farrah looks at my dick
like it's the Eye of Sauron.

931
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:17,568
Hello?

932
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,411
Did you call me?

933
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,412
No. I did not call you.

934
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:23,412
I think you did.

935
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,553
And what would I have said
if I had called you?

936
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:27,487
That you want to see me?

937
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,155
Well, that would be nice,
except I didn't call you.

938
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,251
Do you want to see me?

939
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:33,522
I'm hanging up now.

940
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:36,929
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

941
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:40,624
Why?

942
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,564
I like hearing the sound of your voice.

943
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:53,208
Bye, Randall.

944
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:54,544
Maggie!

945
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:02,052
You like hearing the sound of her voice?

946
00:51:02,124 --> 00:51:03,682
Shut up.

947
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:07,024
Do you have a brain tumor?
Were you molested by a Care Bear?

948
00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:08,926
Were you abducted by aliens?

949
00:51:08,998 --> 00:51:10,022
You hate women.

950
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,567
Why else would you
screw so many of them?

951
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:14,865
It's time for you to overdose.

952
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:16,731
Oh! Oh!

953
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:18,602
Oh, she rejected you!

954
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:20,437
That's why you want her.

955
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:22,534
It's the first time in history
that's ever happened.

956
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

957
00:51:23,913 --> 00:51:25,813
I was wondering something.
Aren't you rich?

958
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,009
Why are you sleeping on my couch?

959
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,684
You're my big brother.

960
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:36,313
Here.

961
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:39,919
For people who never entered puberty.
Take six.

962
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,254
All right.

963
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:47,158
You all right?
- Can I pay by check?

964
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:50,603
Sam, remember I told you
that the pharmacies only take cash?

965
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:52,573
Maggie! Mag!

966
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:55,104
Um... But, listen,
why don't you just get on the bus,

967
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:56,644
we'll work it out there.
Okay? All right. Good.

968
00:51:56,712 --> 00:51:58,236
Maggie, I want to talk to you.

969
00:51:58,314 --> 00:52:00,179
I can't talk right now, all right?

970
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:02,114
- I'm getting on a bus to Canada.
- Canada?

971
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:03,344
Yes. Yes, Canada.

972
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:05,387
These people can't afford
to pay for their prescriptions here.

973
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:07,285
Maggie, will we have bathroom breaks?

974
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:09,688
Sophie, remember I told you
that there's a bathroom on the bus?

975
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,693
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

976
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:14,025
- Okay. When do you get back?
- Never.

977
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:17,229
- Tomorrow night, late.
- How late?

978
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,259
Just forget about it, okay? Please?
I'm begging you.

979
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,770
Why don't you take a pen?

980
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:31,779
I'll send you a pamphlet
and an efficacy statement, okay?

981
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:33,838
What time is it, do you know?

982
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,851
Wow. Okay, I got to go.
I'll give you a call, okay?

983
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:42,924
We've come a long, long way together

984
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:46,519
Through the hard times and the good

985
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:51,427
I have to celebrate you, baby

986
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,267
I have to praise you like I should

987
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:00,736
...know.

988
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,836
Know how to handle large sums of money

989
00:53:03,913 --> 00:53:05,847
with harmony and with love,

990
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:09,248
and that the truth is
that you have high ideals,

991
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:12,754
and that you are a person
of great personal integrity,

992
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:17,122
and you will keep your mind focused
upon financial prosperity.

993
00:53:31,707 --> 00:53:34,642
Looks like you got
all your stuff, right? Okay. Good.

994
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,372
- You guys travel home safe.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

995
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:38,936
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

996
00:53:39,281 --> 00:53:41,613
- Bye, Maggie!
- Bye.

997
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:04,533
Hi.

998
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:08,966
When you end it, I get to hate you,

999
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,173
and act all cold,
and tell embarrassing stuff to my friends.

1000
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:13,437
Okay.

1001
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,245
And you don't get to move in,

1002
00:54:15,317 --> 00:54:18,377
or become friends with my friends,
or introduce me to your parents.

1003
00:54:18,454 --> 00:54:20,388
This is what this is, whatever this is.

1004
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:21,480
Are you done?

1005
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:23,288
Have you been here all night?

1006
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,724
Yes.

1007
00:54:29,665 --> 00:54:31,326
Oh, Christ!

1008
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:37,698
Why am I mad at you already?

1009
00:55:16,745 --> 00:55:19,976
Oh, Jamie. It's Brucie.
You want to meet me?

1010
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:23,382
I've got a load of love in my trunk for you.
Something you're going to like.

1011
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:24,851
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1012
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,286
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
Call me, call me, call me.

1013
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:28,584
You're gonna love me, love me...

1014
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,483
Ah!

1015
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:35,326
Jamie, it's Bruce. Where are you?

1016
00:55:35,397 --> 00:55:36,796
Who are you?

1017
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:42,933
Let the games begin!

1018
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:51,103
Make it hot! Make it hot!

1019
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,341
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth?

1020
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:56,145
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1021
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:58,743
Men with diabetes,
men with prostate cancer,

1022
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:00,721
men with massive penile injuries.

1023
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:04,657
Men with performance anxiety,
men with any common form of impotence

1024
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:06,319
or sexual dysfunction.

1025
00:56:06,395 --> 00:56:09,091
Men without a useful erection in years!

1026
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:10,993
Boing!

1027
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:14,502
Minimum side effects, long-term safety.
This isn't a pill.

1028
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,505
This is a revolution. Questions?

1029
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:18,972
Yeah. Where are the samples?

1030
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,975
Right here, baby. Right here.

1031
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:23,841
You sure you want one? You want two?
Who wants two?

1032
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:27,576
Did you see this? Bob Dole says
his TV commercials for Viagra

1033
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,448
won't hurt his wife's campaign
for President.

1034
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:32,248
He also says the Viagra commercials

1035
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:35,848
won't hurt his campaign
to nail Heather Locklear.

1036
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:38,325
The dick drug! That's my brother's!

1037
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:39,821
Oh, my God!

1038
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:41,522
Oh, my God!

1039
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:46,728
Viagra, the little pill that has started
a gold rush for its manufacturer,

1040
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:48,463
the drug giant Pfizer.

1041
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,601
Jamie! Jamie! Hey!

1042
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,103
- Ted Goldstein, ENT.
- Oh, Ted, hi. How are you?

1043
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:58,044
I'm good. Look, I got this friend,
he's a radiologist.

1044
00:56:58,113 --> 00:57:00,240
He has a little problem. I thought maybe...

1045
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:01,715
Say no more.

1046
00:57:02,718 --> 00:57:03,776
You're a gem.

1047
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:06,616
Viagra is the first-ever pill
to treat impotence.

1048
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:09,852
It's easy, it's effective,
and it's now wildly in demand.

1049
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,896
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1050
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,761
Oncologists are writing it,
shrinks are writing it,

1051
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:18,629
gastroenterologists are writing it.

1052
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,794
Pediatricians are writing it for themselves!

1053
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:23,066
I mean, pharmacies could
stay open 24 hours

1054
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:24,298
and they still couldn't meet the demand.

1055
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:26,136
We're running 1,200 prescriptions a month.

1056
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:29,143
That's more than my entire year's quota!
And you don't care.

1057
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:32,647
About a bunch of old guys
with stiffies? Nope.

1058
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,307
How can you be so callous?

1059
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:37,648
Men are suffering worldwide
from shame and...

1060
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:45,217
And frustration.

1061
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:53,127
Oh, you're my little blue pill.

1062
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:56,134
Oh, for God's sake.

1063
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:58,332
No. What about this do you think is okay?

1064
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:01,467
What are you...
I don't want to see this! No.

1065
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:02,874
What the fuck are you doing?

1066
00:58:02,945 --> 00:58:05,675
- No, no, no! This is too much information.
- I just need this.

1067
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,012
Are you fucking filming it?

1068
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:10,074
Do you do, like, close-ups and shit?

1069
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:14,345
Who holds it?

1070
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:26,923
Hey.

1071
00:58:29,872 --> 00:58:31,100
Wake up.

1072
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:32,572
Oh!

1073
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:34,631
Again?

1074
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:40,904
Maggie!

1075
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:46,314
Come on. I'm an artist. This is work.

1076
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:49,156
Oh, my God.

1077
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:50,714
Say something.

1078
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,623
You're just too weird.

1079
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,857
Yeah, well...

1080
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:01,862
Hi, there. Jamie Randall here.

1081
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:07,634
Just reporting from bed,
having just fucked my girlfriend.

1082
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,007
- And...
- Don't use that word.

1083
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,343
What? You use "fuck" all the time.

1084
00:59:12,414 --> 00:59:14,609
No, not "fucking. " "Girlfriend. "

1085
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:17,249
That's what you are.

1086
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,748
I am?

1087
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,384
Yeah, you are.

1088
00:59:27,763 --> 00:59:29,560
I guess I am.

1089
00:59:33,435 --> 00:59:35,096
Jesus.

1090
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,417
I lived in a place called Okfuskee

1091
00:59:56,658 --> 01:00:00,287
And I had a little girl in a holler tree

1092
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:05,832
I said, "Little girl it's plain to see

1093
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:10,069
"Ain't nobody that can sing like me

1094
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:13,336
"Ain't nobody that can sing like me "

1095
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:21,509
She said it's hard for me to see

1096
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:26,146
How one little boy got so ugly

1097
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:31,323
Yes, my little girly that might be

1098
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:35,726
But there ain't nobody
that can sing like me

1099
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,665
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

1100
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:42,069
Way over yonder in the minor key

1101
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:47,842
Way over yonder in the minor key

1102
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,968
No, Mom.

1103
01:00:49,044 --> 01:00:53,140
No, it's not an aphrodisiac.
It's a vasodilator.

1104
01:00:53,215 --> 01:00:55,843
A vasodilator. No, Ma...

1105
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,447
No, just... No, I...

1106
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,817
Yeah, I've already sold
2,000 prescriptions this month alone.

1107
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:04,414
It's a lot of money.

1108
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:09,888
Okay, I really can't talk.
Maggie needs me.

1109
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:11,125
Okay, bye.

1110
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,870
I thought you said
it was 1,200 prescriptions.

1111
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:18,228
It is.

1112
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:22,902
Well, why did you tell her 2,000?

1113
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,835
Did I?

1114
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:28,607
Are you kidding?

1115
01:01:29,785 --> 01:01:31,377
I don't know, it just sounded better.

1116
01:01:34,056 --> 01:01:36,217
You told your mother a lie
because it sounds better?

1117
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:40,159
Look, she doesn't know numbers.

1118
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,561
Do you tell me lies
because they sound better?

1119
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:43,856
No!

1120
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:44,921
Well, why did you do it with her?

1121
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,025
Because she wants to
know that I'm doing well...

1122
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:48,660
Okay, but you are doing well,

1123
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:50,728
so why do you need
to make it sound better?

1124
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:53,001
Okay, you know what?

1125
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:55,873
I will call her back up right now,
and I will correct my mistake.

1126
01:01:55,944 --> 01:01:57,070
Okay?

1127
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:02,482
Tell me four good things about yourself.

1128
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:05,947
Excuse me?

1129
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:07,777
You heard me.

1130
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:10,790
Okay.

1131
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:14,591
Four good things about myself.

1132
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,091
I can...

1133
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:20,896
Why are we doing this?

1134
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:22,493
This is just... I don't...

1135
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:25,005
You can't even think
of four good things about yourself.

1136
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:26,097
What? I totally can!

1137
01:02:26,174 --> 01:02:27,607
Do you think that you're generous?

1138
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:31,103
Do you think you're sweet?

1139
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,443
Not particularly.

1140
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:36,814
Do you think that you're smart?

1141
01:02:37,953 --> 01:02:39,784
Oh, my God!

1142
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:43,280
Look at you.

1143
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:47,959
You're this

1144
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:50,287
talented,

1145
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:57,401
charming, handsome, capable,
determined, smart man.

1146
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:04,142
I am?

1147
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,782
Yes, you are.

1148
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:17,981
I can juggle.

1149
01:03:22,664 --> 01:03:24,996
- Does it make it longer?
- Time or inches?

1150
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,433
How come we can't take it?
You can.

1151
01:03:27,502 --> 01:03:29,436
Are you saying
that we can get hard?

1152
01:03:29,504 --> 01:03:31,995
There is some indication
of increased lubrication.

1153
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:36,639
- If they come inside you, does it burn?
- No.

1154
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,703
How about in your mouth?

1155
01:03:39,514 --> 01:03:41,675
Jamie, we want more Viagra!

1156
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,615
- More! More Viagra!
- More Viagra!

1157
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:48,155
Stan! Come here. Come over here!

1158
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:52,125
Ladies, this is Dr. Stan Knight,
king of all internists.

1159
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:53,957
Right? And this is...

1160
01:03:54,029 --> 01:03:55,621
Cassie.

1161
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,858
But my friends call me Lisa.

1162
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,030
Lisa wants to marry a doctor, so good luck.

1163
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,434
Oh, dear.

1164
01:04:02,504 --> 01:04:04,597
Ladies, next round is on me! Okay?

1165
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:08,669
Nice jacket, man.

1166
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:37,364
Did you get laid?

1167
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:38,899
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1168
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:41,035
- Six times.
- Mmm.

1169
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:43,569
I was scared that you were.

1170
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:46,780
You're crazy.

1171
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:03,420
What?

1172
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,491
Is everything okay?

1173
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:08,262
Jamie... Honey?

1174
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,170
- Honey, your heart's beating really fast.
- I know.

1175
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,600
What's...

1176
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:15,809
Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie.

1177
01:05:16,978 --> 01:05:18,809
Jamie. It's okay. It's okay.

1178
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,904
Talk to me.

1179
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:21,771
I...

1180
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:23,440
I...

1181
01:05:23,685 --> 01:05:26,415
Okay, you know what? Just breathe.
Don't even worry about it.

1182
01:05:26,488 --> 01:05:27,887
Just breathe.

1183
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,951
It's okay.

1184
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,417
I...

1185
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:37,094
- I love you.
- What?

1186
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:41,300
Just give me a second, okay?

1187
01:05:42,137 --> 01:05:43,468
Oh, God, I do.

1188
01:05:45,173 --> 01:05:46,162
Uh...

1189
01:05:46,641 --> 01:05:48,302
- No, you don't.
- Don't touch me!

1190
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:49,707
Okay.
Do you want a glass of water?

1191
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:50,767
I'm sorry.

1192
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,837
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

1193
01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:54,609
- A little water?
- Yeah, water.

1194
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:57,440
Oh, yeah.

1195
01:05:58,453 --> 01:06:01,115
Okay, see? Here you go. Here you go.

1196
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:03,282
Okay.

1197
01:06:09,364 --> 01:06:11,559
- I love you. I can't stop saying it.
- You don't...

1198
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:14,898
- Just stop saying that, okay?
- I can't. I love you.

1199
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:16,960
You don't understand.

1200
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:19,903
I've never said that to anyone before.

1201
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,235
- You've never said "I love you"?
- No.

1202
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:26,978
You never said it to your parents?

1203
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:31,576
No.

1204
01:06:31,653 --> 01:06:33,416
- You never said it to your brother?
- Ugh!

1205
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,555
Jesus, you're more fucked up than I am.

1206
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:39,360
I once said it to a cat.

1207
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:44,154
- Okay, that makes me feel better.
- It does? Okay, good.

1208
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:45,995
You can hold me now.

1209
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,593
Okay.

1210
01:06:55,677 --> 01:06:56,666
Oh!

1211
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,041
Joshie!

1212
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,511
That is disgusting.

1213
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:10,954
Jamie, I didn't know
you were coming home!

1214
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,391
Oh!

1215
01:07:16,064 --> 01:07:17,463
Hey.

1216
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:20,729
Listen, it's not what it looks like, okay?

1217
01:07:20,802 --> 01:07:22,326
Well, it kind of is, but...

1218
01:07:22,404 --> 01:07:23,701
Okay, just chill.

1219
01:07:23,772 --> 01:07:25,171
Yeah, chill. Oh, I'm sorry,

1220
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,936
I thought I just caught my brother
masturbating while watching me have sex.

1221
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:30,536
Well, I was focusing on her.

1222
01:07:30,779 --> 01:07:31,939
Oh, "her. "

1223
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:34,038
- You mean my girlfriend! I'm sorry.
- No.

1224
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:35,878
Not on her!

1225
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,250
On her body parts!
Does video make everything look bigger?

1226
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,755
Because I didn't think
her tits were that big.

1227
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:43,313
Then I saw you,

1228
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:45,985
and I was like, "What,
did an anaconda get loose on the bed?"

1229
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:47,085
This is so twisted.

1230
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:50,096
Do you think Dad's big?
I mean, he was when we were kids,

1231
01:07:50,165 --> 01:07:53,896
but then everything's bigger
when you're a kid, right?

1232
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,398
Fine! Okay? Sorry!

1233
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:58,831
My self-esteem would prefer

1234
01:07:58,907 --> 01:08:02,308
that you not have a bigger penis
than me right now, that's all!

1235
01:08:02,377 --> 01:08:03,844
Shh! Shh!

1236
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:07,548
Don't be mad.

1237
01:08:11,319 --> 01:08:13,583
Run, Josh. Run, Josh.

1238
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:15,054
Run, Joshie.

1239
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:18,820
We can talk about this like men!
Ow! You're gonna ruin the tape!

1240
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:23,028
No normal human being
can possibly fit in this back seat.

1241
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:24,690
That definition excludes you, Josh.

1242
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:27,758
I'd literally be more comfortable
in the back of a Hot Wheels right now.

1243
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:30,402
I've lost all feeling in my legs.

1244
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:34,698
- Are you okay?
- No!

1245
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:36,937
I'm not talking to you, Josh.

1246
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,112
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1247
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,340
Okay.

1248
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:17,637
He's waiting for you.

1249
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:20,545
- So, how are you doing?
- Fine. How's Maggie?

1250
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:25,947
Come in!

1251
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:28,512
- Whoa!
- No, come in, come in.

1252
01:10:32,927 --> 01:10:34,087
Testosterone, man.

1253
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:38,025
Chicago's in two days. I must prepare.

1254
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,428
It's a fucking orgy
masquerading as a medical convention.

1255
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:43,698
- You're coming, aren't you?
- I don't know.

1256
01:10:44,272 --> 01:10:46,934
- Oh, right. How's she doing?
- She's great.

1257
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,073
Well, I'm not. I need a break.

1258
01:10:49,477 --> 01:10:51,411
HMOs are killing me. Killing me!

1259
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:55,142
I need a lot of loosely moraled women
to throw themselves at me. Hard.

1260
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,214
Speaking of which...

1261
01:10:58,253 --> 01:11:00,619
Oh, you are a god! You're a god, sir!

1262
01:11:00,688 --> 01:11:01,916
You're really not coming to this?

1263
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,321
You could do something for me.

1264
01:11:03,725 --> 01:11:04,714
Yeah, what's that?

1265
01:11:04,993 --> 01:11:07,257
You could start prescribing Zoloft
instead of Prozac.

1266
01:11:08,496 --> 01:11:09,622
Um...

1267
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:12,990
Well, Trey's a friend of mine, man.

1268
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,926
I know. I know.

1269
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:22,669
- Sure. Zoloft. Okay. Why not?
- Great.

1270
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:28,479
- Hey!
- Hey.

1271
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,349
How was your day?

1272
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,951
Amazing.

1273
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:36,345
Mmm?

1274
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,123
You?

1275
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,389
Me? My day was...

1276
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,124
My day was swell.

1277
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,458
- I went to the clinic...
- You did?

1278
01:11:47,535 --> 01:11:49,469
...for a scrip

1279
01:11:50,805 --> 01:11:55,333
and waited for three hours sitting next
to a man with a fork stuck in his head.

1280
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,038
- What?
- Yep.

1281
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:02,482
And then I went
to the pharmacy to get the scrip filled.

1282
01:12:04,152 --> 01:12:06,814
Which was closed,

1283
01:12:08,156 --> 01:12:10,386
so no meds for Maggie.

1284
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:19,490
Are you okay?

1285
01:12:22,403 --> 01:12:23,961
Why, do I look like shit?

1286
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:25,335
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah.

1287
01:12:25,406 --> 01:12:28,534
You didn't say. You didn't say it out loud.

1288
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:38,416
Thanks, I'd love one.

1289
01:12:41,856 --> 01:12:43,187
Sorry.

1290
01:12:47,762 --> 01:12:50,128
You think maybe you've had enough?

1291
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:52,860
Nope, I don't, but you do.

1292
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:54,524
Excuse me?

1293
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:58,038
Tell me, Randall, what exactly is it
about me that's so desirable?

1294
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:01,868
There's going to be 600 girls
dying to blow you at this convention.

1295
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,271
- Well, I'm not going to the convention.
- Why not?

1296
01:13:04,412 --> 01:13:10,578
Go out with some sexy, limber
ex-cheerleader from Alabama,

1297
01:13:10,952 --> 01:13:14,444
who's just dying to discuss
market projections and sales techniques.

1298
01:13:14,889 --> 01:13:18,882
Or just a hot HMO administrator
who likes to bake cookies

1299
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,452
and rub your head
while you discuss the evils of generics.

1300
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:24,823
Or just, you know, I don't know,
a normal person,

1301
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:28,300
who has energy and likes to do things
and have fun!

1302
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:29,358
I happen to want you.

1303
01:13:29,437 --> 01:13:33,168
Why? Why? What are you trying to prove?

1304
01:13:33,641 --> 01:13:36,007
Are you trying to show
that you're not a flake?

1305
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:40,241
Are you trying to stick with something
for once in your goddamn life?

1306
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,749
I mean, you do realize
that you are not a good person

1307
01:13:42,817 --> 01:13:44,808
because you pity-fuck the sick girl, right?

1308
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:00,892
I almost went home with
someone from the clinic today.

1309
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:02,262
All right.

1310
01:14:03,938 --> 01:14:05,599
- There, you see?
- All right.

1311
01:14:06,774 --> 01:14:08,605
Don't forget your pager.

1312
01:14:46,981 --> 01:14:48,710
Come with me to Chicago.

1313
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,852
- Keith! How you doing, man?
- Jamie. Good.

1314
01:14:57,925 --> 01:15:00,086
So good to see you.
Everything going well?

1315
01:15:00,328 --> 01:15:03,661
I'm going to go off and do some girly thing,
whatever that is.

1316
01:15:03,998 --> 01:15:06,330
- How will I reach you?
- I'll beep you.

1317
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,159
Stage One?

1318
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:12,331
I'm sorry?

1319
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,840
My son's a Stage Three.

1320
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:16,071
It's not obvious, don't worry.

1321
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:18,743
We're across the street.

1322
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:23,711
Whenever you get tired of this bullshit
and want to hear what's really going on...

1323
01:15:24,352 --> 01:15:26,013
Thank you.

1324
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:37,194
Fuck soup.

1325
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,263
Fuck shoelaces.

1326
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:42,264
Fuck jewelry. And fuck brushing teeth.

1327
01:15:44,205 --> 01:15:47,368
- Fuck...
- Trying to tie your tie. Fuck...

1328
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,636
Trying to button down a shirt.

1329
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,042
And fuck that meditation shit.

1330
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,340
And who knew God wanted us
to be so good

1331
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:59,682
at giving hand jobs?

1332
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:06,057
My husband is always smiling.

1333
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,562
Parkinson's has made me

1334
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:21,805
more sensitive and more compassionate.

1335
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:26,809
Hopefully, got a long way to go in all this.
I feel good, and...

1336
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:30,849
So, it's a constant battle of
trying to maintain some dignity

1337
01:16:30,918 --> 01:16:32,249
and grace in society.

1338
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:35,650
And to overcome that,
you just live with what you have.

1339
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,763
Offering to hold the kid for just a minute,
and he ends up in that tree over there.

1340
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:54,664
One of my girlfriends asked me once
if she could get me anything.

1341
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:58,605
I said, "How about a new brain?
Nothing fancy. "

1342
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:00,939
She said, "My husband's not using his. "

1343
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,274
Wait. Wait.

1344
01:17:05,286 --> 01:17:09,780
Never mind. Sorry.
I thought I heard a cure coming.

1345
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:16,019
But there are good things.

1346
01:17:16,297 --> 01:17:20,961
You have to understand
that you're still yourself.

1347
01:17:21,302 --> 01:17:24,965
You're still there. And life goes on.

1348
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,632
And life is beautiful. Thank you.

1349
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:38,312
Parkinson's, right?

1350
01:17:39,153 --> 01:17:40,313
Oh, no. No.

1351
01:17:40,388 --> 01:17:41,719
No, your wife.

1352
01:17:42,156 --> 01:17:43,987
Girlfriend.

1353
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:47,153
Stage One.

1354
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:49,158
Good days and bad days, huh?

1355
01:17:49,664 --> 01:17:51,154
Mostly good days.

1356
01:17:52,066 --> 01:17:53,055
You?

1357
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:55,065
Wife. Since '73.

1358
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,168
Stage Four.

1359
01:17:57,905 --> 01:17:59,497
You got any advice?

1360
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:02,334
- You don't need my advice.
- Come on. I'm very trainable.

1361
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:08,043
My advice is to go upstairs,
pack your bags, and leave a nice note.

1362
01:18:08,115 --> 01:18:09,844
Find yourself a healthy woman.

1363
01:18:12,186 --> 01:18:16,350
I love my wife. I do.
But I wouldn't do it over again.

1364
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:20,190
The thing nobody tells you,

1365
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:23,287
this disease will steal
everything you love in her.

1366
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:24,922
Her body, her smile, her mind.

1367
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:28,866
Sooner or later, she'll lose motor control.

1368
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,704
Eventually, she won't even
be able to dress herself.

1369
01:18:32,773 --> 01:18:36,106
Then, the fun really begins.
Cleaning up her shit.

1370
01:18:36,544 --> 01:18:38,876
Frozen face. Dementia.

1371
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,782
It's not a disease, it's a Russian novel.

1372
01:18:46,787 --> 01:18:49,278
Look, I'm sorry. I'm out of line.

1373
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:52,056
Hang in there.

1374
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,989
Did you realize there are
other people with Parkinson's?

1375
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,164
How remarkable!

1376
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:04,164
Amazing people. People doing things.

1377
01:19:04,405 --> 01:19:08,603
Like this one woman runs marathons,
and another one scuba dives.

1378
01:19:08,676 --> 01:19:11,509
And they're pissed off
and they're tired of being marginalized.

1379
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:13,240
Oh, my God, they are so cool!

1380
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:16,713
I feel good. I feel really good.

1381
01:19:16,784 --> 01:19:19,514
I feel better than I have felt in a long time,
and you brought me here.

1382
01:19:19,587 --> 01:19:22,920
I mean, okay, whatever,
it was the wrong convention, sure, but...

1383
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:26,190
Jamie, I... Jamie.

1384
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,458
- I have been such a bitch to you.
- Oh, no.

1385
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:34,592
And you didn't even run away.
How is that possible?

1386
01:19:34,869 --> 01:19:36,860
It's like, this is...

1387
01:19:37,705 --> 01:19:39,605
Like, the first time in my life that I've

1388
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,273
ever not felt alone.

1389
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:48,207
That someone is there for me.
Do you know what that means?

1390
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:50,380
Oh, my God.

1391
01:19:54,288 --> 01:19:55,482
I love you.

1392
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:58,614
I do.

1393
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:03,553
I love you. I love you, I love you.

1394
01:20:03,898 --> 01:20:05,729
I really love you.

1395
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:36,594
- Hey.
- Hey.

1396
01:20:36,664 --> 01:20:38,325
What are you doing?

1397
01:20:39,266 --> 01:20:40,426
Nothing.

1398
01:20:40,935 --> 01:20:42,425
I fell asleep.

1399
01:20:48,142 --> 01:20:49,905
A cure for Parkinson's?

1400
01:20:50,511 --> 01:20:51,773
That's what I'm asking.

1401
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,105
Pfizer, I'm a GP.

1402
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:57,283
Twenty universities, 15 teaching hospitals,
every major drug company,

1403
01:20:57,351 --> 01:20:59,182
and the goddamn NIH
are all working on this.

1404
01:20:59,453 --> 01:21:01,148
And I'm sure the second they find it,

1405
01:21:01,222 --> 01:21:02,951
you're gonna be
the first in line to sell it to me.

1406
01:21:03,357 --> 01:21:05,518
Well, in the meantime, she gets worse.

1407
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:09,058
What is this, General Hospital?
What do you want me to do?

1408
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,529
I want you to feel bad about it, Stan.

1409
01:21:10,798 --> 01:21:13,232
If I felt bad about every patient
that I couldn't help,

1410
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,460
then I don't make it through the day.

1411
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:16,196
What are the cutting edge treatments?

1412
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,665
I don't know.
You want me to get you a list?

1413
01:21:18,739 --> 01:21:20,138
Great. Tomorrow.

1414
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,975
Pfizer, you're a nice kid.

1415
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:28,479
You're starting to do well.
You sure you want to do this?

1416
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:31,174
And a list of doctors,
and someone who I can contact at NIH.

1417
01:21:31,318 --> 01:21:32,307
Thank you, Stan.

1418
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,315
Sure.

1419
01:21:57,845 --> 01:21:59,073
See this green area here?

1420
01:22:01,348 --> 01:22:02,679
I'm sorry.

1421
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,220
Tell me, anybody

1422
01:22:09,523 --> 01:22:10,854
You okay?

1423
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,057
Take the Z-Pak. Okay?

1424
01:22:18,132 --> 01:22:19,121
Jesus!

1425
01:22:20,401 --> 01:22:23,529
Do you really give a damn for me?

1426
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,373
I'm sorry, Mr. Randall.
That credit card is declined.

1427
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,544
About a thing that's bothering me

1428
01:22:33,614 --> 01:22:36,447
The benefits of chelation,
every toxic metal is removed.

1429
01:22:36,517 --> 01:22:38,985
I was a rambling pony

1430
01:22:39,053 --> 01:22:40,486
We've achieved complete remission

1431
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:42,784
in patients with
advanced metastatic cancer,

1432
01:22:43,557 --> 01:22:44,581
MS...

1433
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:45,781
Fuck!

1434
01:22:45,926 --> 01:22:47,393
...Parkinson's, lupus.

1435
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,754
This therapy changes people's lives.

1436
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,063
He forgot "world peace. "

1437
01:22:54,635 --> 01:22:57,035
Are you saying to me
that we flew 2,000 miles,

1438
01:22:57,104 --> 01:22:59,732
on our own nickel, so you can tell me
that our appointment's been postponed?

1439
01:23:00,808 --> 01:23:02,002
For two weeks?

1440
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,810
I'd like to talk to Dr. Rosenblum, okay?

1441
01:23:05,312 --> 01:23:07,405
Do I look like I care?

1442
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:11,240
I don't give a shit where he is!
I don't understand...

1443
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,811
Get the head of the hospital on the phone.

1444
01:23:15,089 --> 01:23:17,114
We've arranged our entire schedule
around that,

1445
01:23:17,191 --> 01:23:18,215
and then you come and you tell me...

1446
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:21,193
No, you don't understand. Okay?
We waited two weeks...

1447
01:23:21,562 --> 01:23:24,656
I would like to talk
to the head of the hospital about it.

1448
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,689
Hey.

1449
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:31,527
Hey.

1450
01:23:31,939 --> 01:23:33,736
- I am so fed up with those people.
- I want to go home.

1451
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:35,298
Okay, look, we can do the test,
and then go home, okay?

1452
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:36,434
Randall.

1453
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,035
There's just all this red tape
and all this new protocol...

1454
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:42,173
Don't try to sell me! Please! Okay?
I'm not going to get better.

1455
01:23:42,449 --> 01:23:46,112
- That's bullshit.
- This is bullshit. I'm tired and I'm bored.

1456
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,779
What are you bored of?

1457
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:50,289
Parkinson's isn't my life!
I have Parkinson's.

1458
01:23:50,357 --> 01:23:53,053
Why can't I just live my life
instead of becoming this project?

1459
01:23:53,127 --> 01:23:55,118
Do you know that
what's ahead of me is bad enough?

1460
01:23:55,362 --> 01:23:56,852
- Don't you want to get...
- No!

1461
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,793
You want. This has become
way too important to you.

1462
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:01,661
What are you talking about?
Don't you want to get better?

1463
01:24:01,802 --> 01:24:06,296
Yes! Desperately! It's not going to happen.
All right? News flash, there's no cure.

1464
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:10,737
Apparently you need to know
that I'll get better in order to love me.

1465
01:24:11,879 --> 01:24:13,141
That's insane.

1466
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,215
You need to get your stuff
out of my apartment.

1467
01:24:25,659 --> 01:24:27,149
What the hell?

1468
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:31,628
You're on the fast track, Randall.
Chicago, then management.

1469
01:24:31,832 --> 01:24:33,459
Next stop, CEO.

1470
01:24:34,468 --> 01:24:36,163
You can't do that
with a sick person holding you back.

1471
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,397
I can do anything I want.

1472
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:39,136
I know.

1473
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:43,670
You're a good man.

1474
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,406
In fact, you're a wonderful man.

1475
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,573
Much better
than you give yourself credit for.

1476
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,579
Nobody wants to be
the one who runs away.

1477
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:55,344
- I'm not running away.
- It's not your choice.

1478
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,592
Let's just go home.
We can even make love.

1479
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,758
And then you have to leave.

1480
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:24,715
This is so stupid.

1481
01:25:24,785 --> 01:25:25,877
Stop.

1482
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:32,089
We don't have to do this.

1483
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,052
Good-bye.

1484
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:10,381
Hi. You have reached M. Murdock.

1485
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:14,223
If I'm not picking up, it's probably
because I don't want to talk to you.

1486
01:27:17,998 --> 01:27:20,330
This is actually sad.

1487
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:23,563
Are you trying to get it
in the actual garbage,

1488
01:27:23,637 --> 01:27:25,195
or just around it, to piss it off?

1489
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,074
Stan! What's up?

1490
01:27:34,348 --> 01:27:37,840
What's fucking up is your friend,
Lisa-Cassie, whatever her name is,

1491
01:27:37,918 --> 01:27:40,910
is having a pajama party
at some rich guy's house this evening.

1492
01:27:41,188 --> 01:27:42,280
Pajama party?

1493
01:27:42,356 --> 01:27:43,345
What's a pajama party?

1494
01:27:43,757 --> 01:27:45,952
Is that, like, girls wearing pajamas?
Getting naked?

1495
01:27:46,026 --> 01:27:51,020
I thought maybe you might bring by
a little vitamin V, some little men in blue.

1496
01:27:51,298 --> 01:27:54,529
Stan, I'd love to. I don't think I can.
I'm feeling a little...

1497
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:55,590
What are you doing?

1498
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:57,034
Yes, Stan, it's me, Jamie.

1499
01:27:57,104 --> 01:27:59,504
I'll totally be there. See you later. Bye.

1500
01:27:59,773 --> 01:28:01,741
Hey, you and I are going to a pajama party.

1501
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,369
So, you should get ready,
'cause I'm in pajamas.

1502
01:28:05,245 --> 01:28:06,337
I'm having second thoughts, Jamie.

1503
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:08,176
I haven't been to a pajama party
since 4th grade.

1504
01:28:08,248 --> 01:28:09,715
What if people start
taking their clothes off?

1505
01:28:09,783 --> 01:28:12,308
Oh, my God! I didn't want
to come here in the first place.

1506
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:13,478
You're the one who wanted to come.

1507
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:14,748
Will people have to see me naked?

1508
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:16,221
I can't even pee in front of other people.

1509
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:17,279
You have a beautiful body.

1510
01:28:17,357 --> 01:28:19,882
I don't know how many times I have
to tell you, you have a beautiful body.

1511
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,757
It's actually very upsetting
when you say that.

1512
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,556
Well, look who's here!

1513
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,892
How working class. Love it.

1514
01:28:30,804 --> 01:28:31,896
Come in.

1515
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:53,583
How the fuck am I supposed to do
good medicine on 50 patients a day?

1516
01:28:54,261 --> 01:28:55,592
Plus rounds.

1517
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:59,592
And phone calls every day with family...
Fucking idiots,

1518
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:03,599
telling you, "No, you're wrong,"
because they looked it up on the Internet.

1519
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:09,599
I fight over billing,
I fight over prescription coverage.

1520
01:29:10,944 --> 01:29:15,040
The insurance companies
are dedicated to not paying you.

1521
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:19,609
And the big law firms, man,
they're just waiting.

1522
01:29:19,953 --> 01:29:24,947
They're just betting you're going to
make that one big mistake.

1523
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,623
This profession for me,
it was a higher calling.

1524
01:29:30,964 --> 01:29:33,023
You know? Make people's lives better.

1525
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,370
And look at me.

1526
01:29:43,477 --> 01:29:44,967
Here they are, for Christ's sake.

1527
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:48,147
Randall, get up from the floor!
Come with me.

1528
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:50,939
Come with me. Come on! Come on!

1529
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:52,311
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you all right?

1530
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,579
Go forth, my son. Be fruitful and multiply.

1531
01:29:57,491 --> 01:30:01,825
The thing about the software business
is it's very, very volatile.

1532
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:05,723
You never know where
the financial model's going to go.

1533
01:30:05,999 --> 01:30:08,126
It changes every six months.

1534
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,602
And you never know
what these hospitals are gonna want.

1535
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:13,731
One day
it's peer-to-peer connectivity,

1536
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:18,141
then next it's top-down integration
with their preexisting infrastructure.

1537
01:30:21,014 --> 01:30:22,276
You can touch them, if you want.

1538
01:30:22,616 --> 01:30:24,277
Oh! Oh.

1539
01:30:25,519 --> 01:30:26,850
Thank you.

1540
01:30:29,022 --> 01:30:30,421
- This way. You'll see.
- No, no, no.

1541
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:32,355
- I don't think we should do this.
- I have a surprise for you.

1542
01:30:32,426 --> 01:30:34,758
No, no, no. Turn around. I've got a surprise.

1543
01:30:35,362 --> 01:30:37,592
This is my homegirl, Khae.

1544
01:30:38,765 --> 01:30:39,754
Whoa!

1545
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:42,362
She's Thai.

1546
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:44,200
And I'm Thai-curious.

1547
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:46,906
Engine turning over won't you start?

1548
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:52,106
This one's come to tear me all apart

1549
01:30:52,879 --> 01:30:55,040
She's Jamie-curious.

1550
01:30:57,417 --> 01:31:00,477
Be still my heart

1551
01:31:00,554 --> 01:31:02,647
- So am I.
- No, no, wait. I don't...

1552
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:05,754
Engine turning over won't you start?

1553
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,486
This one's come to tear me all apart

1554
01:31:09,563 --> 01:31:11,656
Be still my heart

1555
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:14,223
Did I mention that
I just took my company public?

1556
01:31:14,568 --> 01:31:15,762
It's a pretty exciting thing

1557
01:31:15,836 --> 01:31:17,997
because you work
on something for so long,

1558
01:31:18,071 --> 01:31:20,767
and then
when it comes, it's...

1559
01:31:21,775 --> 01:31:24,005
You know, you see the fruits bear...

1560
01:31:24,077 --> 01:31:28,741
Okay! So, I really have
mixed feelings about this.

1561
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:35,244
We like Jamie.

1562
01:31:35,555 --> 01:31:39,218
We like Jamie very much.

1563
01:31:39,693 --> 01:31:42,321
Oh. Oh.

1564
01:31:42,896 --> 01:31:44,056
What's wrong?

1565
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:05,441
Sorry! I'm sorry!

1566
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:07,447
- Josh!
Be careful.

1567
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:10,717
- I'm sorry. Stan.
Hey, Pfizie.

1568
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,258
Josh! Ow!

1569
01:32:14,628 --> 01:32:15,617
Josh! Oh!

1570
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:17,787
Wait! We were just talking!

1571
01:32:18,198 --> 01:32:20,291
- Hi.
- Hi. We got to go.

1572
01:32:20,367 --> 01:32:21,356
Now?
- Josh!

1573
01:32:21,635 --> 01:32:23,728
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

1574
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:24,828
We'll keep in touch.

1575
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,740
It feels like a frozen Popsicle.

1576
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:31,508
Shit. I didn't know that could even happen.

1577
01:32:31,578 --> 01:32:34,445
It's very rare, but it happens.

1578
01:32:34,514 --> 01:32:37,142
- Do you think they'll have to amputate?
- Shut the fuck up, Josh, and drive!

1579
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:38,206
Bad joke.

1580
01:32:39,419 --> 01:32:42,354
Fuck! Sorry. I was looking for the shift!

1581
01:32:42,923 --> 01:32:44,481
- So fucking...
- Sorry.

1582
01:32:44,858 --> 01:32:46,155
You know, for whatever it's worth,

1583
01:32:46,226 --> 01:32:48,854
this has truly been
the best night of my life.

1584
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:49,953
That's wonderful.

1585
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:51,691
No, seriously. I'm not even kidding.

1586
01:32:51,932 --> 01:32:53,229
And I have you to thank for it.

1587
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:56,326
I mean, I never thought I would have
an experience like this ever in my life.

1588
01:32:56,570 --> 01:33:00,870
And this is the incredible thing.
This is why I'm so happy right now.

1589
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:06,136
Because I fucked that girl.
Oh, my shit, I fucked that girl!

1590
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:07,202
And I'm thinking to myself,

1591
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,943
"Oh, my God, this is empty!
I feel absolutely nothing at all! "

1592
01:33:11,451 --> 01:33:12,918
- That's great, Josh.
- Yeah.

1593
01:33:12,986 --> 01:33:15,750
All those years I was so jealous of you
for having empty sex,

1594
01:33:15,822 --> 01:33:17,687
and now I was the one
having the empty sex,

1595
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:20,693
and I realized in that moment
that if I hadn't experienced it,

1596
01:33:21,027 --> 01:33:25,293
I wouldn't have known
how much I didn't want it. You know?

1597
01:33:25,365 --> 01:33:30,166
And now I can go back home to Farrah
and feel really good about myself

1598
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:34,469
for the first time in my entire life.

1599
01:33:34,674 --> 01:33:36,073
And it's all because of you, Jamie.

1600
01:33:36,309 --> 01:33:38,174
It's all because of my big brother Jamie,

1601
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,611
with the enormous cock
that won't go down!

1602
01:33:41,915 --> 01:33:43,314
So thank you, brother!

1603
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:44,811
Sorry! My bad!

1604
01:33:48,588 --> 01:33:51,421
Plus, my Pfizer stock's up 40%.

1605
01:33:58,165 --> 01:33:59,189
- Hi.
- Hi.

1606
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:01,928
- Can I help you?
- I'm having a drug reaction.

1607
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:03,466
What kind of drug reaction?

1608
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,207
Oh. Oh.

1609
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:12,201
Just take a seat
and we'll be right with you.

1610
01:34:21,788 --> 01:34:22,948
What?

1611
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:27,624
Chicago.

1612
01:34:28,862 --> 01:34:30,056
I got it.

1613
01:34:30,163 --> 01:34:35,191
Dude. Congratulations!
That is unbelievable.

1614
01:34:35,802 --> 01:34:39,966
Jamie, that's everything that
you've wanted. That's incredible, man.

1615
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:44,041
I'm very proud of you. I'm not surprised,
but I am very proud of you.

1616
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:45,972
You know who's going to be thrilled,
is Mom and Dad.

1617
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:49,614
Jamie Randall makes good.
That's incredible, man.

1618
01:34:49,683 --> 01:34:51,651
You should be very, very proud of yourself.

1619
01:34:51,718 --> 01:34:52,707
Mmm.

1620
01:34:59,059 --> 01:35:01,357
If you're going to serve beef bourguignon,

1621
01:35:01,428 --> 01:35:03,396
you should at least offer
a proper Burgundy.

1622
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:06,062
Or a Pinot, for Christ's sake.

1623
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,297
Randall.

1624
01:35:14,574 --> 01:35:15,563
Maggie.

1625
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:20,870
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Jeremy.

1626
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,009
- Justin.
- Justin! Justin.

1627
01:35:25,418 --> 01:35:26,749
I'll go get the car.

1628
01:35:27,087 --> 01:35:29,248
That would be great, Justin.

1629
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:43,162
I... I was...

1630
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:51,509
I tried to call you...

1631
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:53,336
I'm with someone.

1632
01:35:53,413 --> 01:35:55,176
Yeah, I can see that.

1633
01:35:59,786 --> 01:36:00,946
So...

1634
01:36:03,356 --> 01:36:04,550
How are you?

1635
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:07,348
I'm good.

1636
01:36:08,628 --> 01:36:09,617
Good.

1637
01:36:11,665 --> 01:36:12,859
Come on.

1638
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,358
I gotta go.

1639
01:36:15,835 --> 01:36:17,029
Maggie?

1640
01:36:23,476 --> 01:36:24,636
It

1641
01:36:27,147 --> 01:36:28,478
was nice to see you.

1642
01:36:33,987 --> 01:36:35,716
You're killing me, Randall.

1643
01:36:36,823 --> 01:36:40,554
- Hey. There he is! You ready to celebrate?
- Hey.

1644
01:36:41,227 --> 01:36:42,216
Maggie!

1645
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:45,755
- Hi, Bruce.
- How are you?

1646
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,728
What are you celebrating?

1647
01:36:49,002 --> 01:36:51,903
This young rock star is about to
take Chicago by storm.

1648
01:36:56,409 --> 01:36:57,535
You got Chicago?

1649
01:37:01,681 --> 01:37:04,616
Congratulations. It was good
to see you, Bruce. I should go.

1650
01:37:04,684 --> 01:37:05,673
Nice to see you, Maggie.

1651
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,012
Peace.

1652
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:09,547
Uh...

1653
01:37:14,861 --> 01:37:17,796
So, I called it, didn't I call it?
What'd I tell you? Say, "I called it. "

1654
01:37:17,864 --> 01:37:19,331
- You should've put money on it.
- I called it.

1655
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:20,627
Where you gonna live?

1656
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,464
Downtown, maybe.
Somewhere far away from my family.

1657
01:37:23,536 --> 01:37:24,798
Downtown?

1658
01:37:25,038 --> 01:37:28,303
You? You want Near North, man.
Pussy!

1659
01:37:29,042 --> 01:37:31,704
And bistros, bars,
pussy, pussy, pussy.

1660
01:37:34,214 --> 01:37:36,375
Why don't I move out near you?
The 'burbs.

1661
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:37,973
We'll go get a beer every once in a while.

1662
01:37:38,051 --> 01:37:40,713
Nah. You don't want to do that. No.

1663
01:37:41,054 --> 01:37:42,214
Why not?

1664
01:37:50,463 --> 01:37:53,523
I got a big raise, buddy. Big raise.

1665
01:37:54,067 --> 01:37:55,398
- You're kidding me.
- Thanks to you!

1666
01:37:56,202 --> 01:37:57,260
Those bastards.

1667
01:37:57,804 --> 01:38:01,137
Buddy, I was never going to get Chicago.
I'm too valuable to them in the field.

1668
01:38:01,241 --> 01:38:02,230
I can't believe this.

1669
01:38:02,308 --> 01:38:05,243
Give me some credit!
It takes a sophisticated eye

1670
01:38:05,345 --> 01:38:08,109
to spot talent in colossal fuck-ups
such as yourself.

1671
01:38:09,015 --> 01:38:11,245
- I don't understand.
- Don't be so naive.

1672
01:38:11,317 --> 01:38:12,579
I didn't actually want to go to Chicago.

1673
01:38:12,652 --> 01:38:14,142
I wanted you to think
I wanted to go to Chicago,

1674
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,585
so you'd want to go to Chicago.

1675
01:38:15,655 --> 01:38:17,213
So you'd work your ass off to get there.

1676
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:18,655
- Oh, Bruce, this is unbelievable.
- Me,

1677
01:38:18,858 --> 01:38:21,326
I love the road! I love a stinky motel!

1678
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:24,630
I love the barren back roads
and strip malls of the heartland!

1679
01:38:24,864 --> 01:38:25,888
That's what I love.

1680
01:38:25,965 --> 01:38:27,296
Why would I want to live
in my own house?

1681
01:38:27,367 --> 01:38:28,391
That I pay for?

1682
01:38:28,468 --> 01:38:29,935
Why would I want to
watch my kids play Little League?

1683
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:32,928
Why the fuck would I want to
sleep in the same bed as my wife?

1684
01:38:33,006 --> 01:38:34,940
Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

1685
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:07,031
Okay, so...
Okay, so...

1686
01:39:09,642 --> 01:39:12,110
- What's...
- Talk?

1687
01:39:12,178 --> 01:39:13,372
- Yeah.
- All right.

1688
01:39:14,147 --> 01:39:16,672
- Hi, there. Hi. I'm Maggie Murdock.
- Hello!

1689
01:39:18,184 --> 01:39:21,642
I'm about to have
delicious reprobate sex with...

1690
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:24,178
What's your name?

1691
01:39:24,257 --> 01:39:25,485
Oh, come on.

1692
01:39:25,558 --> 01:39:28,550
Oh, right, right. Jamie something.

1693
01:39:28,628 --> 01:39:33,531
And we're taping it so that he can
always remember how totally hot I am.

1694
01:39:33,767 --> 01:39:34,961
Was.

1695
01:39:35,034 --> 01:39:37,332
Kids, if you're watching this,

1696
01:39:37,403 --> 01:39:39,769
you put it back in Mommy's
secret hiding spot right now

1697
01:39:39,839 --> 01:39:42,706
or you will be sorry.
There will be consequences!

1698
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:45,942
What else?

1699
01:39:46,746 --> 01:39:47,872
Um...

1700
01:39:51,217 --> 01:39:53,208
Just how happy I am,

1701
01:39:54,387 --> 01:39:56,412
in this moment, right now.

1702
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:01,360
The way the light's
hitting that face of yours.

1703
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:06,257
There's this little breeze
coming in through the window.

1704
01:40:07,901 --> 01:40:12,565
It doesn't matter if I have 10,000
more moments like this, or

1705
01:40:14,507 --> 01:40:16,634
just this one, because

1706
01:40:19,746 --> 01:40:21,236
it's all the same.

1707
01:40:23,783 --> 01:40:25,978
Yeah. Just that.

1708
01:40:28,121 --> 01:40:30,180
Right now, this moment.

1709
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,856
I have this.

1710
01:40:50,543 --> 01:40:51,669
No. Damn it!

1711
01:40:52,445 --> 01:40:54,072
Richard! Richard!

1712
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:55,938
Where is she?

1713
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:21,030
I been drifting along
in the same stale shoes

1714
01:41:22,775 --> 01:41:28,372
Loose ends tying the noose
in the back of my mind

1715
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:30,006
Come on! Come on.

1716
01:41:32,018 --> 01:41:33,042
Hey!

1717
01:41:33,419 --> 01:41:34,545
Hey!

1718
01:41:36,322 --> 01:41:39,519
To where the puzzles and pagans lay

1719
01:41:40,894 --> 01:41:42,259
Maggie!

1720
01:41:43,529 --> 01:41:45,963
Hey! Mag!

1721
01:41:50,036 --> 01:41:51,025
Jamie?

1722
01:41:51,437 --> 01:41:52,426
Pull over.

1723
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:54,503
No, I can't "pull over"!

1724
01:41:54,841 --> 01:41:56,502
Just for a second! Pull over!

1725
01:41:59,712 --> 01:42:03,148
I need to talk

1726
01:42:03,449 --> 01:42:04,473
to you.

1727
01:42:05,351 --> 01:42:08,548
I don't want to talk to you.

1728
01:42:08,621 --> 01:42:15,083
When I wake up
someone will sweep up my lazy bones

1729
01:42:16,596 --> 01:42:23,092
And we will rise in the cool of the evening

1730
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:26,701
Wait, wait. Okay.

1731
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:30,305
Open the door. Okay.

1732
01:42:37,483 --> 01:42:38,643
Sorry.

1733
01:42:41,554 --> 01:42:43,249
- I need you.
- Please go away.

1734
01:42:43,623 --> 01:42:45,614
I drove a really long way to say that.

1735
01:42:45,692 --> 01:42:46,852
What? Am I supposed to be impressed?

1736
01:42:47,493 --> 01:42:48,517
I don't know. Yes.

1737
01:42:50,563 --> 01:42:53,532
Look, can you just get off the bus
so we can talk for a second?

1738
01:42:53,766 --> 01:42:56,462
- Just for a second.
- We're on a schedule.

1739
01:42:57,103 --> 01:42:58,764
Five minutes. Please.

1740
01:42:59,906 --> 01:43:02,397
You guys don't mind
if we take five minutes, do you?

1741
01:43:02,475 --> 01:43:03,999
He's handsome.

1742
01:43:05,078 --> 01:43:06,409
- Five minutes.
- He is.

1743
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,140
Five minutes, then I'll let you go.

1744
01:43:18,524 --> 01:43:20,685
I'm full of shit, okay?

1745
01:43:22,929 --> 01:43:26,888
No, I'm knowingly full of shit.

1746
01:43:29,936 --> 01:43:31,267
Because...

1747
01:43:32,438 --> 01:43:33,803
Because...

1748
01:43:36,242 --> 01:43:37,402
I have...

1749
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:42,745
I have never cared about anybody,
or anything, in my entire life.

1750
01:43:43,216 --> 01:43:45,650
And the thing is,
everybody just kind of accepted that.

1751
01:43:45,718 --> 01:43:47,743
Like, "That's just Jamie! "

1752
01:43:51,124 --> 01:43:52,614
And then you...

1753
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:57,193
Jesus.

1754
01:43:57,897 --> 01:43:59,057
You.

1755
01:44:04,904 --> 01:44:06,064
You.

1756
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:12,005
You didn't see me that way.

1757
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:17,642
I have never known anyone

1758
01:44:19,318 --> 01:44:23,311
who actually believed that I was enough.

1759
01:44:25,825 --> 01:44:27,122
Until I met you.

1760
01:44:35,168 --> 01:44:37,534
And then you made me believe it, too.

1761
01:44:40,506 --> 01:44:43,475
So, unfortunately,

1762
01:44:45,344 --> 01:44:46,834
I need you.

1763
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,341
And you need me.

1764
01:44:51,284 --> 01:44:52,444
No, I don't.

1765
01:44:53,352 --> 01:44:54,876
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

1766
01:44:54,954 --> 01:44:55,978
Yes, you do.

1767
01:44:56,355 --> 01:44:57,549
Stop it. Stop saying that.

1768
01:44:58,391 --> 01:45:00,382
- You need someone to take care of you.
- No, I don't.

1769
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:02,252
Everybody does.

1770
01:45:10,503 --> 01:45:12,562
I'm going to need you
more than you need me.

1771
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:17,205
- That's okay.
- No, it's not!

1772
01:45:18,211 --> 01:45:19,838
It isn't fair.

1773
01:45:22,381 --> 01:45:24,178
I have places to go.

1774
01:45:25,418 --> 01:45:26,407
You'll go there.

1775
01:45:28,387 --> 01:45:29,945
I just may have to carry you.

1776
01:45:37,063 --> 01:45:39,930
I can't ask you to do that.

1777
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:43,061
You didn't.

1778
01:45:49,709 --> 01:45:50,801
Hey,

1779
01:45:51,978 --> 01:45:54,640
let's just say in some

1780
01:45:55,681 --> 01:45:59,048
alternate universe,
there's a couple that's just like us, okay?

1781
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,519
Only she's healthy and he's perfect.

1782
01:46:03,256 --> 01:46:07,249
And their world is about how much money
that they're gonna spend on vacation,

1783
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:09,590
or who's in a bad mood that day,

1784
01:46:09,662 --> 01:46:12,290
or whether they feel guilty
about having a cleaning lady.

1785
01:46:15,768 --> 01:46:16,928
I don't want to be those people.

1786
01:46:18,571 --> 01:46:20,061
I want us.

1787
01:46:23,109 --> 01:46:24,269
You.

1788
01:46:26,512 --> 01:46:27,672
This.

1789
01:46:44,463 --> 01:46:47,193
I used to worry a lot about
who I'd be when I grew up.

1790
01:46:49,802 --> 01:46:52,794
You know,
like how much money I'd make or...

1791
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,874
Someday I'd become some big deal.

1792
01:46:58,878 --> 01:47:01,745
Sometimes the thing you most want
doesn't happen.

1793
01:47:03,049 --> 01:47:07,713
And sometimes the thing
you never expect to happen, does.

1794
01:47:08,955 --> 01:47:12,789
Like giving up my job in Chicago
and everything,

1795
01:47:13,793 --> 01:47:17,320
and deciding to stay
and apply to med school.

1796
01:47:18,831 --> 01:47:20,321
I don't know.

1797
01:47:20,733 --> 01:47:22,894
You meet thousands of people,

1798
01:47:23,903 --> 01:47:26,235
and none of them really touch you.

1799
01:47:28,507 --> 01:47:30,998
And then you meet one person,

1800
01:47:32,011 --> 01:47:35,674
and your life is changed forever.

1801
01:47:38,985 --> 01:47:42,512
Suppose I never ever saw you

1802
01:47:44,423 --> 01:47:47,187
Suppose we never ever called

1803
01:47:49,328 --> 01:47:53,094
Suppose I kept on singing love songs

1804
01:47:53,165 --> 01:47:57,761
Just to break my own fall

1805
01:47:57,837 --> 01:48:02,103
Just to break my fall

1806
01:48:03,075 --> 01:48:07,910
Just to break my fall

1807
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:12,843
Just to break my fall

1808
01:48:13,753 --> 01:48:18,247
Break my fall
Break my fall

1809
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:23,459
All my friends say
that of course it's gonna get better

1810
01:48:23,529 --> 01:48:24,689
Gonna get better

1811
01:48:24,764 --> 01:48:31,260
Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better!

1812
01:48:31,337 --> 01:48:34,636
I never love nobody fully

1813
01:48:37,076 --> 01:48:40,045
Always one foot on the ground

1814
01:48:42,181 --> 01:48:46,174
And by protecting my heart truly

1815
01:48:46,252 --> 01:48:50,848
I got lost in the sounds

1816
01:48:50,923 --> 01:48:56,088
I hear in my mind all of these voices

1817
01:48:56,162 --> 01:49:01,293
I hear in my mind all of these words

1818
01:49:01,367 --> 01:49:06,464
I hear in my mind all of this music

1819
01:49:06,539 --> 01:49:11,272
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

1820
01:49:11,577 --> 01:49:16,480
I hear in my mind all of these voices

1821
01:49:16,549 --> 01:49:21,714
I hear in my mind all of these words

1822
01:49:21,787 --> 01:49:27,157
I hear in my mind all of this music

1823
01:49:27,226 --> 01:49:31,424
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

1824
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:36,531
It breaks my heart

1825
01:49:37,403 --> 01:49:41,737
When it breaks my heart

1826
01:49:42,775 --> 01:49:46,836
When it breaks my heart

1827
01:49:47,813 --> 01:49:50,213
When it breaks my heart

1828
01:49:50,282 --> 01:49:52,773
Breaks my heart

1829
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:54,979
When it breaks my heart

1830
01:49:55,388 --> 01:50:03,253
When it breaks my heart
