1
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,573
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:08,449
Jimmy?

3
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:10,493
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

4
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:12,328
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,998
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,126
No.

7
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:21,713
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:51,117
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

9
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:54,120
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

10
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:07,550
As far back as I can remember,
l always wanted to be a gangster.

11
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:48,549
To me. . .

12
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:53,137
being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

13
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:59,811
Even before I first wandered
into the cabstand for an after- school job. . .

14
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,063
l knew l wanted to be a part of them.

15
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:04,649
lt was there that l knew l belonged.

16
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:09,320
To me, it meant being somebody
in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

17
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:12,573
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

18
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:16,327
They double- parked in front of a hydrant,
nobody ever gave them a ticket.

19
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,830
In the summer,
when they played cards all night. . .

20
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,124
nobody ever called the cops.

21
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:35,179
Tony Stacks. How are you?

22
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,932
Tuddy Cicero.

23
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,393
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

24
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,562
- How are you?
- Good.

25
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,023
Tuddy.

26
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,985
Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the BeIIa Vista Pizzeria. . .

27
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:53,781
and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

28
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,705
Paulie might have moved slow. . .

29
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:07,128
but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

30
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,426
- It's your fault.
- You started it.

31
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,636
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:20,224
At first my parents loved that l found
a job across the street from the house.

33
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:25,104
My father, who was lrish,
was sent to work at the age of 1 1 .

34
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,190
He liked that l got myself a job.

35
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:30,902
He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

36
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:34,322
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

37
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:36,115
See you, Mikey.

38
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,492
Bye, Henry.

39
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,660
Henry! Watch how you cross!

40
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,245
Bring back milk!

41
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:44,540
My mother was happy after
she found out that the Ciceros. . .

42
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:48,252
came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother. . .

43
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,214
that was the answer to all her prayers.

44
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:55,134
I was the Iuckiest kid in the worId.

45
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:58,137
l could go anywhere, l could do anything.

46
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,973
l knew everybody,
and everybody knew me.

47
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,185
Wiseguys would pull up
and Tuddy would toss me their keys. . .

48
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:06,104
and let me park their Cadillacs.

49
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:09,857
Here I am, this IittIe kid,
l can't even see over the steering wheel. . .

50
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,193
and l'm parking Cadillacs.

51
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,532
But it wasn't too long. . .

52
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,536
before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.

53
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:23,329
For your mother and sister.

54
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:26,874
For them, the cabstand was supposed
to be a part- time job. But for me. . .

55
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,001
it was definitely full- time.

56
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,087
That's aII I wanted to do.

57
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:35,424
People like my father could never
understand, but l was a part of something.

58
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:38,386
l belonged. l was treated like a grown- up.

59
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,721
Tell him 51 9.

60
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,890
Every day l was learning to score.

61
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,560
A doIIar here, a doIIar there.

62
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:47,645
l was living in a fantasy.

63
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,732
Have a good day at school?

64
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,693
My father was always pissed off.

65
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,987
Pissed that he made such lousy money. . .

66
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,073
pissed that my kid brother Michael
was in a wheeIchair.

67
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,494
He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

68
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,621
Tell me about this.

69
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,082
It's a letter from school.

70
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:11,419
It says you haven't been there in months.

71
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,005
In months!

72
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,258
You're a bum !

73
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,552
Want to grow up to be a bum?

74
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:25,266
After a while, he was mostly pissed
because l hung around the cabstand.

75
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,310
He knew what went on at that cabstand.

76
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:32,106
Every once in a while, l'd have to take
a beating. But by then, l didn't care.

77
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,150
The way l saw it. . .

78
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:37,111
everybody takes a beating sometime.

79
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:42,074
- I can't make any more deliveries.
- What? You'll fuck everything up.

80
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,285
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

81
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,912
Come on with me.

82
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:48,080
- Is that him, kid?
- No.

83
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,458
- How about him?
- No.

84
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,503
- That's the guy.
- Get him.

85
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:57,632
Excuse me.

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,469
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

87
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,395
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:13,147
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:15,524
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:19,487
From now on, any letter from that school
to his house comes directly here.

91
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:20,738
- Understand?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,616
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house. . .

93
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,285
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

94
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:30,748
That was it. No more Ietters from
truant officers. No Ietters from schooI.

95
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,000
ln fact, no more letters from anybody.

96
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,963
Finally after a few weeks, my mother
went to the post office to complain.

97
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:38,965
How could l go to school after that. . .

98
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:43,261
and pledge allegiance to the flag
and sit through good government bullshit?

99
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,517
Paulie hated phones.
He wouIdn't have one in his house.

100
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:52,353
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

101
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,355
All right, make the call.

102
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:58,109
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back. . .

103
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,318
from an outside phone.

104
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,946
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

105
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:07,451
There were guys, that's all they did
all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

106
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:21,382
For a guy who moved all day long,
Paulie didn't talk to six people.

107
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,552
lf there was a union problem
or, say, a beef in the numbers. . .

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,222
only the top guys could meet
with Paulie to discuss the problem.

109
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,642
Everything was one- on- one.
PauIie hated conferences.

110
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:34,854
He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said. . .

111
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:38,316
and he didn't want anybody listening
to what he was being told.

112
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:42,737
Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,
he got a piece of everything they made.

113
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:47,241
lt was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

114
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:51,871
All they got from Paulie was protection
from other guys looking to rip them off.

115
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,958
That's what it's aII about. That's what
the FBI couId never understand.

116
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,586
What Paulie and the Organization does. . .

117
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:02,673
is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops. That's it.

118
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:07,386
That's all it is. They're like
the police department for wiseguys.

119
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:21,275
People looked at me differently,
and they knew l was with somebody.

120
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:25,780
l didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.

121
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:27,323
The owner knew who I was with. . .

122
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:30,868
and he'd come from around the counter.
No matter how many were waiting. . .

123
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,037
I was taken care of first.

124
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,623
Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore. . .

125
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,417
even though we didn't have a car. At 1 3. . .

126
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:41,462
l was making more money than most
of the grown- ups around.

127
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,757
l had more money than l could spend.
I had it aII.

128
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:59,563
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

129
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,148
You know why?

130
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,818
lt was out of respect.

131
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,655
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

132
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,992
- Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
- My God.

133
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:14,120
You look like a gangster.

134
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:15,996
They shot me. Help!

135
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,418
Henry, shut the door.

136
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,713
That was the first time
l had ever seen anyone shot.

137
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,675
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

138
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,760
I can't have that in this joint.

139
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,637
l remember feeling bad about the guy. . .

140
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,974
but l also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.

141
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:37,852
I knew PauIie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.

142
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,856
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

143
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:45,276
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

144
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,881
lt was a glorious time.

145
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,384
And wiseguys were all over the place.

146
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:14,305
lt was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe. . .

147
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,391
decided to take on a boss and start a war.

148
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,102
It was when I met the worId.

149
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,980
And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.

150
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:27,610
He couIdn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time. . .

151
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:29,695
but he was already a legend.

152
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:33,866
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

153
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:36,619
He'd give the doorman $1 00
just for opening the door.

154
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:40,706
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

155
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:43,834
The bartender got $1 00
just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

156
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:47,087
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

157
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,052
- Want a drink?
- Give me a 7 and 7.

158
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,562
- I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
- How you doing?

159
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,651
- Thank you.
- Keep them coming.

160
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:11,820
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

161
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:13,614
He was first locked up at 1 1 . . .

162
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:16,867
and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 1 6.

163
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,828
See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

164
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:22,373
But what Jimmy really loved to do. . .

165
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,542
what he really loved to do was steal.

166
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,919
He actually enjoyed it.

167
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:31,006
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies.

168
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,467
Give me your wallet.

169
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:39,598
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

170
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:42,184
He was one of
the city's biggest hijackers. . .

171
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:45,938
of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

172
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:49,024
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.

173
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:53,070
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

174
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,905
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

175
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,198
Help the lady.

176
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,409
Drivers Ioved him.
They used to tip him off. . .

177
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,162
about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

178
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,415
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

179
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,000
Okay, see you later.

180
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,170
Henry, come here.

181
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,132
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How're you doing, Henry?

182
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,301
You're gonna be working together, okay?

183
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:17,177
Help him. Go ahead.

184
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:19,680
Jimmy, you got anything good?

185
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:24,059
And when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

186
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:25,227
How're you doing?

187
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,146
He made them partners.

188
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:29,023
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

189
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:30,858
- One Pall Mall.
- There you go.

190
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:33,152
- What do you need?
- Two Luckies.

191
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,279
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

192
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,363
What do you need?

193
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:39,199
- One Pall Mall.
- One Pall Mall, here you go.

194
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,035
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

195
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:44,204
- You have permission from your mother?
- How many cartons you need?

196
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:47,416
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

197
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,335
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

198
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:52,755
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

199
00:13:57,594 --> 00:13:59,428
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

200
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:01,388
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

201
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:05,392
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

202
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:08,479
Docket number 7041 62.

203
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,857
Yes, sir. That's me.

204
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,404
Just stand there. Now stay there.

205
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,579
Counselor, proceed.

206
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,209
Congratulations.

207
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,419
Here's your graduation present.

208
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:35,547
- What for? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.

209
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,758
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

210
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:41,095
- I thought you'd be mad.
- I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

211
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:45,557
You took your first pinch like a man
and learned the two greatest things in life.

212
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:48,060
- What?
- Look at me.

213
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,896
Never rat on your friends. . .

214
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,399
and always keep your mouth shut.

215
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:57,861
Here he is.

216
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,280
You broke your cherry.

217
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,956
Congratulations!

218
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:46,910
By the time l grew up,
there was $30 biIIion a year in cargo...

219
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,829
moving through ldlewild Airport. . .

220
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:52,082
and beIieve me,
we tried to steal every bit of it.

221
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,002
See, you gotta understand,
we grew up near the airport.

222
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,670
lt belonged to Paulie.

223
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:59,506
We had friends and reIatives
who worked all over the place.

224
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:03,510
They would tip us off about
what was coming in and moving out.

225
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,764
lf any truckers or airlines gave us trouble. . .

226
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:11,018
Paulie had the union people scare them
with a strike. It was beautifuI.

227
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:14,980
lt was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

228
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,941
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

229
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,569
To us, it was better than Citibank.

230
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:34,041
You got a phone? Come on !

231
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,961
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

232
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,635
There was Jimmy. . .

233
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,428
and Tommy and me.

234
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,430
And there was Anthony Stabile.

235
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:50,140
How're you doing?

236
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,892
Frankie Carbone.

237
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:57,064
And then there was Mo BIack's brother,
Fat Andy.

238
00:16:58,107 --> 00:17:00,150
And his guys, Frankie the Wop.

239
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:03,987
Freddy No Nose.

240
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:09,451
And then there was Pete the KiIIer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

241
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,747
Then you had Nickey Eyes. . .

242
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,750
and Mikey Franzese.

243
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,335
That guy, I wanna see him.

244
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:22,130
Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname
because he said everything twice.

245
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

246
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:40,732
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

247
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,693
Suits are coming Thursday.

248
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,779
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

249
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:48,073
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

250
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:52,619
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

251
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:55,455
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

252
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,877
To us, those goody- good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks. . .

253
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:03,964
and took the subway to work every day
and worried about biIIs, were dead.

254
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:07,050
They were suckers. They had no balls.

255
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:09,720
lf we wanted something, we just took it.

256
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:14,349
lf anyone complained twice, they got hit
so bad they never complained again.

257
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:18,020
lt was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.

258
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,650
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

259
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:25,193
I can't believe this guy.

260
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:29,323
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

261
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,328
Piece of cake. It's all there.

262
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:37,789
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

263
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:40,417
- No problem, right?
- I'll take care of it.

264
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:51,386
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

265
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,058
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

266
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,728
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money. . .

267
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,855
into French money and send it back here.

268
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:04,066
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

269
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,736
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

270
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:10,572
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

271
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,117
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

272
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:18,163
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

273
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:23,001
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

274
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,170
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

275
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,673
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

276
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,675
What about the security?

277
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:31,051
Security?

278
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:34,471
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight- to- eight man.

279
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,098
I'm the commandant.

280
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:39,059
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

281
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:41,770
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.

282
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:43,522
- Good.
- We're on.

283
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:48,151
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

284
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,404
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

285
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:52,781
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

286
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:56,243
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

287
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:57,869
I know I'm resting.

288
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:01,331
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

289
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,418
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."

290
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:08,964
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

291
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:11,591
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

292
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:19,224
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

293
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:23,395
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

294
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:27,232
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

295
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,361
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

296
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,489
I thought he was gonna shit.

297
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,619
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

298
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,959
Funny. You're really funny.

299
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,129
What do you mean, I'm funny?

300
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:52,549
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

301
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,426
You're a funny guy.

302
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,637
You mean the way I talk? What?

303
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:01,183
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

304
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,644
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

305
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:07,147
Funny how? What's funny about it?

306
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,650
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Anthony.

307
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,320
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

308
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:14,780
Funny, how?

309
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:19,493
Just, you know. You're funny.

310
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,828
Let me understand this.

311
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:24,039
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

312
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:27,542
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

313
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,879
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

314
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:33,715
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

315
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:39,513
You know, how you tell a story.

316
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:43,517
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

317
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:47,104
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

318
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,022
Tell me what's funny.

319
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,571
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

320
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:59,866
Motherfucker! I almost had him !

321
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,994
You stuttering prick, you !

322
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:05,080
Frankie, was he shaking?

323
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:09,960
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

324
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,632
Jesus Christ.

325
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,427
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

326
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:22,931
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

327
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,351
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

328
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,436
Could you take care of this?

329
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:31,398
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

330
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,483
That's what I want to talk to you about.

331
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:37,070
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

332
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:41,074
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order- -

333
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:43,243
Don't mean to be out of order?

334
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:45,537
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

335
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:49,416
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

336
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,418
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

337
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,587
You know the money
we spend in this fucking- -

338
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:56,006
- Don't be like that.
- What do you mean?

339
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:05,932
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

340
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,606
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron !

341
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,358
You don't want to bring the check?

342
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:19,029
Do you believe this prick?

343
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:24,618
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

344
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,453
You're a funny guy.

345
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:29,497
- That's it, Henry.
- No, go back.

346
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:35,337
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

347
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:38,256
I charged him $7,000.

348
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,303
You really are a funny guy.

349
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:50,101
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

350
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:52,437
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

351
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:56,149
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

352
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:59,319
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

353
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:02,822
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

354
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,910
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

355
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,163
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

356
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:12,791
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

357
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,459
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

358
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:18,255
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

359
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:20,840
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

360
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:23,343
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

361
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:26,304
- Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
- What could I do?

362
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:30,558
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

363
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:33,395
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

364
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:35,772
- You think it's all right?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:42,195
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

366
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:45,323
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

367
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:48,201
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

368
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,454
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.

369
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:55,375
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

370
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:58,545
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

371
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:02,132
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

372
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:05,760
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

373
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:09,723
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

374
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,310
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

375
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:15,729
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

376
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:19,566
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

377
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:22,736
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

378
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:26,156
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

379
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,283
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

380
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:37,709
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

381
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:40,378
I just need help. Help me, please.

382
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:43,590
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

383
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:46,593
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

384
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:49,429
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

385
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:51,139
That's how often he's in there.

386
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:55,060
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

387
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:58,688
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

388
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,857
It's not even fair.

389
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:02,609
You don't understand.

390
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:06,237
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

391
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:10,492
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

392
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:14,537
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

393
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,790
Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.

394
00:26:16,957 --> 00:26:19,125
Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy. . .

395
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:20,585
he can caII PauIie.

396
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:23,546
Now the guy's gotta come up
with Paulie's money every week. . .

397
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:24,798
no matter what.

398
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:29,010
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.

399
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:31,971
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me."

400
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,307
Can I get one of those TVs?

401
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:36,142
Also, Paulie could do anything.

402
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,354
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?

403
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,481
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.

404
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:43,650
When deIiveries are made
at the front door. . .

405
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:46,486
you move the stuff out the back
and seII it at a discount.

406
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:49,948
You take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $1 00.

407
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,659
lt doesn't matter. lt's all profit.

408
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:56,996
Then finally, when there's nothing left. . .

409
00:26:57,164 --> 00:26:58,123
Fucking shame.

410
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,460
. . .when you can't borrow another buck
or buy another case of booze. . .

411
00:27:02,628 --> 00:27:05,338
you bust the joint out. You light a match.

412
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:07,006
Do you need help reaching anything?

413
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:09,509
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

414
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:11,886
You don't know what you're doing.

415
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,683
She's from the Five Towns.

416
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:18,435
Who?

417
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:22,063
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

418
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:25,442
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

419
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:27,902
She won't go out with me alone.

420
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,113
- No.
- No, what?

421
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,366
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

422
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:35,493
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

423
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,203
All right, what?

424
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,997
Okay, what.

425
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:41,833
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

426
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,210
She's prejudiced against Italians.

427
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:46,546
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

428
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:49,424
What the fuck is this world coming to?

429
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:54,429
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

430
00:27:54,597 --> 00:27:57,724
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

431
00:27:57,892 --> 00:27:59,893
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

432
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,895
See? I knew it.

433
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:04,397
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

434
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,566
- When is this?
- Tomorrow night.

435
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:08,234
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

436
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:11,154
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

437
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,656
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

438
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:16,284
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

439
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:18,244
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

440
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:21,289
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

441
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,543
I don't understand you. She's beautiful !

442
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:28,755
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

443
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:33,301
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

444
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:36,513
You with your fucking mouth.

445
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:45,355
l had a meeting with Tuddy at 1 1 :00,
and here l am, a backup guy for Tommy.

446
00:28:45,773 --> 00:28:48,107
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

447
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,777
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

448
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:52,278
Let me watch your figure.

449
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:53,988
l couldn't wait to get away.

450
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:56,741
l was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.

451
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:59,369
When they were having coffee,
l was asking for a check.

452
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,745
I had business.

453
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,414
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

454
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,669
- Can we have the check?
- What are you doing?

455
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:09,963
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

456
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,131
I got that thing. I gotta go.

457
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:14,467
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

458
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:18,429
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

459
00:29:19,014 --> 00:29:20,807
I couIdn't stand him.

460
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,309
l thought he was really obnoxious.

461
00:29:23,477 --> 00:29:25,520
He kept fidgeting around.

462
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:29,482
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

463
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:36,239
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

464
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:40,535
- Ready?
- Henry, lighten up.

465
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:42,954
We just got here. What are you doing?

466
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:47,333
Before it was time to go home,
he was pushing me into the car. . .

467
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:50,837
then pulling me out. lt was ridiculous.

468
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,673
Diane and Tommy made us promise. . .

469
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:55,717
to meet them again on Friday night.

470
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:57,051
We agreed.

471
00:29:57,219 --> 00:30:00,888
Of course, when Friday night came around,
Henry stood me up.

472
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:03,850
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

473
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:07,395
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

474
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:10,023
We were a trio
instead of a double date that night.

475
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,026
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

476
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,903
But l made Tommy take me
looking for him.

477
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,035
Tommy, what the fuck?

478
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:24,996
You got some nerve standing me up.

479
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:26,539
Nobody does that to me.

480
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:30,376
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

481
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,422
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

482
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,884
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

483
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:40,803
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

484
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:42,388
Talk about it?

485
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:45,224
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

486
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:49,854
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

487
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,314
What do you expect?

488
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:55,276
Let me make it up to you.

489
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:56,736
I'll think about it.

490
00:30:56,904 --> 00:31:00,448
l remember, she was screaming
on the street, and I mean Ioud.

491
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:01,866
But she looked good.

492
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:05,244
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

493
00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:08,039
She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

494
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:10,249
At least that's what l thought.

495
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,794
Hello, Henry.

496
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:14,295
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

497
00:31:14,463 --> 00:31:15,421
Come on.

498
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:17,382
- No, wait a minute.
- What?

499
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:20,426
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that- -

500
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:21,803
Karen.

501
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:23,429
Mom.

502
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:26,432
- I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
- How do you do?

503
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,103
- Nice to meet you.
- My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

504
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:33,106
It's just the good half.

505
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:35,858
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye, see you later, thanks.

506
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:38,277
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

507
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:40,113
He watches the car for me.

508
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,949
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

509
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:45,993
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean?

510
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:56,546
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

511
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:04,637
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

512
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:12,895
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing all right.

513
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,230
Good.

514
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:22,238
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

515
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:15,374
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

516
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,585
Anthony, right in the front.

517
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:20,046
Anything you need, just let me know.

518
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,983
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

519
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,361
- How are you guys doing?
- How are you?

520
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:51,619
- You gave them $20 each.
- It's all right.

521
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:54,205
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

522
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:55,665
- Where?
- Over there.

523
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,792
Thanks a lot, Tony.

524
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:03,422
- What do you do?
- What?

525
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,175
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

526
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:10,471
They don't feel like you're in construction.

527
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,431
I'm a union delegate.

528
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,351
Now, ladies and gentlemen. . .

529
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,106
the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one- liners. . .

530
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:22,233
Henny Youngman.

531
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:32,118
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

532
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,706
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

533
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:41,627
l said, "Where do you wanna go
for our anniversary?"

534
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,671
She said,
"Somewhere l've never been before."

535
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,132
l said, "Try the kitchen."

536
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:48,426
Dr. WeIIsIer is here.

537
00:34:48,594 --> 00:34:51,637
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

538
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,890
Gave him another six months.

539
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:57,768
I Iove this crowd.

540
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,118
Air France made me.

541
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:18,039
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

542
00:35:18,206 --> 00:35:21,792
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

543
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,007
$60,000.

544
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,343
It's going to be a good summer.

545
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:37,058
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

546
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:41,187
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

547
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:42,688
All right.

548
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:45,733
Check, sir.

549
00:35:47,861 --> 00:35:50,696
No. You have to sign for it here.

550
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:54,033
Should I tip him?

551
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,669
- How are you doing?
- Okay. How are you?

552
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,839
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

553
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:11,550
Good to meet you.

554
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:14,512
I'll see you around later.

555
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:21,102
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

556
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:23,062
He lives across the street.

557
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:52,967
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

558
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,096
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

559
00:36:57,264 --> 00:37:00,224
A 21 - year- old kid with such connections.

560
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,437
He was an exciting guy.

561
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:09,066
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

562
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:12,153
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

563
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,864
He knew how to handIe it.

564
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:25,166
Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

565
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,585
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

566
00:37:27,753 --> 00:37:29,045
Even underwater.

567
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:33,841
And remember, Morrie's wigs
are tested against hurricane winds.

568
00:37:34,009 --> 00:37:37,720
Forget about money. You can afford
a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.

569
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,305
Call me now!

570
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:43,059
Come in for a personalized fitting.

571
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:49,982
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

572
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,610
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

573
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:55,196
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

574
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:57,615
Jimmy's being a ball- breaker.

575
00:37:57,783 --> 00:37:59,700
Give him 8- to- 5 on Cleveland.

576
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:03,454
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

577
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:05,289
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

578
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,875
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

579
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:10,252
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

580
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,922
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

581
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,382
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

582
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,509
Fuck him !

583
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:20,054
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

584
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:21,972
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

585
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,809
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

586
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:28,145
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?

587
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:31,524
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

588
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:34,026
You don't got my money?

589
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:36,070
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

590
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:39,698
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

591
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:41,492
Pay me my money.

592
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,244
He'll pay.

593
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:47,123
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

594
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,167
- Jimmy, I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry.

595
00:38:50,335 --> 00:38:53,546
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

596
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:56,674
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

597
00:38:56,842 --> 00:39:00,469
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

598
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:02,763
Karen, slow down.

599
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,100
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

600
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,353
- What happened?
- It's Karen, Jimmy.

601
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,939
- Money today.
- I'll pay.

602
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,076
What happened?

603
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:26,412
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

604
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,038
Who did it?

605
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:32,585
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

606
00:39:37,757 --> 00:39:40,676
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

607
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,512
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

608
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,516
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

609
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,854
He pushed me out of the car.

610
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,614
You sure you're all right?

611
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:08,370
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

612
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:31,894
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

613
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:42,613
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

614
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:45,741
Don't shoot.

615
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:08,889
- Hide this. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

616
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:15,854
I know there are women,
like my best friends. . .

617
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:18,691
who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend. . .

618
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:21,735
gave them a gun to hide. But l didn't.

619
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:25,572
l've got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.

620
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,330
MazeI tov!

621
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:09,825
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

622
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:13,120
He's settling down now. He's married.

623
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:15,581
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

624
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:19,376
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

625
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,595
It was Iike he had two famiIies.

626
00:42:29,804 --> 00:42:34,058
The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

627
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:37,644
PauIie and his brothers had Iots
of sons and nephews.

628
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:40,939
AImost aII of them
were named Peter or PauI.

629
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:43,942
It was unbeIievabIe.

630
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,446
Meet Paulie Jr. , my nephew.
And this is Petey.

631
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,783
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.

632
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,034
This is Marie.

633
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:55,037
Plus, they were all married
to girls named Marie.

634
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:58,165
- She looks Italian.
- She is Italian, you're right.

635
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,085
And they named all their daughters Marie.

636
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:05,672
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

637
00:43:06,007 --> 00:43:09,927
By the time l finished meeting everybody,
l thought l was drunk.

638
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:16,558
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

639
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:21,313
Welcome to the family.

640
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:22,815
Sunday dinner?

641
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:25,651
So beautiful. I want to cry.

642
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:29,071
Here's something to help you get started.

643
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,425
- The bag. The bag.
- What? What bag?

644
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:52,511
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

645
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:56,849
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

646
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,839
He didn't call?

647
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,885
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

648
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:36,221
He's a grown- up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

649
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:39,850
If he was such a grown- up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

650
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:43,479
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

651
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:47,191
You're here a month and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

652
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:49,193
What kind of people are these?

653
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,196
- What do you want me to do?
- Do? What can you do?

654
00:44:52,363 --> 00:44:55,157
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

655
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,909
Did you know what they were like?

656
00:44:57,076 --> 00:45:00,078
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

657
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:03,540
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma! Keep out of it.

658
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,751
You don't know how I feel !

659
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,755
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

660
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:12,424
He's with his friends! Dad !

661
00:45:12,592 --> 00:45:14,593
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

662
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:17,721
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

663
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:30,567
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

664
00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:35,405
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

665
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:40,035
Normal people don't act like this!

666
00:45:41,496 --> 00:45:43,288
What's wrong with you?

667
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:47,543
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

668
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,879
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

669
00:45:51,464 --> 00:45:53,674
What kind of people are they?

670
00:45:56,427 --> 00:45:59,054
We weren't married to nine- to- five guys.

671
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:01,974
But the first time I reaIized how different. . .

672
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:04,518
was when Mickey had a hostess party.

673
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,854
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

674
00:46:08,022 --> 00:46:12,317
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

675
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,154
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

676
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:19,074
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

677
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:20,534
I'd like to smack his face.

678
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:22,369
The red- haired guy, looks like a farmer?

679
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:24,580
The guy's hands are all over me.

680
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:29,126
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

681
00:46:30,712 --> 00:46:32,129
She means it.

682
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:35,465
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie. . . .

683
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:39,261
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

684
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:43,307
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard,
then Vinnie will be there for life.

685
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:46,101
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

686
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:50,022
He was in an argument. A $1 0 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

687
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:53,984
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it. . .

688
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:58,071
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

689
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,659
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

690
00:47:03,494 --> 00:47:06,246
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

691
00:47:06,414 --> 00:47:08,582
Give me a break. She's drunk.

692
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:13,378
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

693
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:18,508
They had bad skin and wore too much
makeup. They didn't look very good.

694
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:21,470
They looked beat- up.
And the stuff they wore. . .

695
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,513
was thrown together and cheap.

696
00:47:23,681 --> 00:47:26,350
A lot of pantsuits and double- knits.

697
00:47:28,227 --> 00:47:29,978
She spends her life in a nightgown.

698
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:32,439
The woman is no angel, believe me.

699
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,108
They talked about their rotten kids. . .

700
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:37,861
and about beating them
with broom handIes and beIts.

701
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:40,947
And that the kids
still didn't pay any attention.

702
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:43,033
When Henry picked me up, l was dizzy.

703
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:45,869
I don't know if I could live like that.

704
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,582
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

705
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,084
Karen.

706
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:54,753
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband- -

707
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:57,214
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

708
00:47:57,382 --> 00:48:00,759
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

709
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:05,639
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

710
00:48:05,973 --> 00:48:07,933
Unless they make themselves get caught.

711
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:09,851
They don't have things organized.

712
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:13,313
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

713
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:17,859
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

714
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:21,029
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

715
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:25,200
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

716
00:48:31,582 --> 00:48:34,292
After a while, it got to be all normal.

717
00:48:35,044 --> 00:48:37,462
None of it seemed Iike crime.

718
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,923
lt was more like Henry was enterprising. . .

719
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:43,802
and that he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys. . .

720
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,972
were sitting on their asses
waiting for handouts.

721
00:48:47,765 --> 00:48:51,727
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
they were blue- collar guys.

722
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:56,523
The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

723
00:48:56,983 --> 00:48:59,484
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

724
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:08,243
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

725
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:20,380
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

726
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:23,216
Did you see him give it right over?

727
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:26,052
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

728
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:32,309
We were all so very close.

729
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:36,354
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

730
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:41,193
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

731
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,694
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

732
00:49:42,862 --> 00:49:47,157
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

733
00:49:47,325 --> 00:49:49,367
Would you read and sign it?

734
00:49:49,577 --> 00:49:51,036
- Anywhere?
- Yeah, anywhere.

735
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:53,747
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

736
00:49:53,915 --> 00:49:57,000
- You boys want some coffee?
- No coffee now, thanks.

737
00:49:58,044 --> 00:50:01,171
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

738
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:03,715
There was always a little harassment.

739
00:50:03,883 --> 00:50:06,676
They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

740
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:10,055
They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

741
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:12,599
But mostly they just wanted a handout.

742
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:16,144
A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

743
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,363
l always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway. . .

744
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:29,407
used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

745
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:33,161
She used to spit on her own floor.
That never made any sense to me.

746
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:36,373
lt was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

747
00:50:45,466 --> 00:50:49,970
We always did everything together,
and we always were in the same crowd.

748
00:50:50,137 --> 00:50:54,099
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

749
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:57,602
The women played cards.

750
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,815
When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy
were the first at the hospital.

751
00:51:01,983 --> 00:51:05,068
When we went to the IsIands
or Vegas for vacation. . .

752
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:06,486
we went together.

753
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:09,698
No outsiders ever. lt got to be normal.

754
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,909
lt got to where l was proud
that I had the kind of husband. . .

755
00:51:13,077 --> 00:51:16,788
who was willing to risk his neck
just to get us the little extras.

756
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,917
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

757
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:22,919
- Can't do it, Karen.
- Why not?

758
00:51:23,087 --> 00:51:25,755
I just can't. I got something lined up.

759
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:29,384
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

760
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:33,138
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

761
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:36,683
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

762
00:51:37,852 --> 00:51:40,145
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

763
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:42,022
How much do you need?

764
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:45,692
- How much?
- That much.

765
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:53,366
This much. Give me a kiss.

766
00:51:56,996 --> 00:51:58,622
See you later.

767
00:52:03,669 --> 00:52:04,920
All right.

768
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:38,995
Welcome home, Batts.

769
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:42,499
Hi, how are you?

770
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,294
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

771
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:49,422
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

772
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,383
There's only one Irishman here.

773
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,551
It's a celebration, fellas.

774
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:56,888
- Top of the morning to you.
- It's good to be home.

775
00:53:01,227 --> 00:53:02,811
This is my friend Jimmy.

776
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,605
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

777
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,608
Tommy. All dressed up.

778
00:53:08,776 --> 00:53:11,736
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

779
00:53:11,904 --> 00:53:14,698
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

780
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:16,950
Come here.

781
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:19,411
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

782
00:53:19,578 --> 00:53:22,414
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

783
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:25,667
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

784
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:27,711
Watch the suit.

785
00:53:28,254 --> 00:53:31,423
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

786
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:35,760
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

787
00:53:35,928 --> 00:53:39,931
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

788
00:53:41,642 --> 00:53:43,893
This kid was great.

789
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:46,187
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

790
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:50,400
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

791
00:53:50,568 --> 00:53:54,529
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

792
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,407
No more shines, Billy.

793
00:53:58,075 --> 00:53:59,534
- What?
- I said no more shines.

794
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:02,454
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

795
00:54:02,621 --> 00:54:04,748
I don't shine shoes anymore.

796
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:09,127
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

797
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:10,587
I'm only kidding with you.

798
00:54:10,755 --> 00:54:14,090
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

799
00:54:14,258 --> 00:54:16,384
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

800
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:20,305
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

801
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:22,390
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

802
00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:24,934
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

803
00:54:29,523 --> 00:54:31,649
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

804
00:54:31,817 --> 00:54:33,318
Motherfucking mutt!

805
00:54:33,486 --> 00:54:35,904
You fucking piece of shit!

806
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,364
Come on, come on !

807
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:42,243
He bought his fucking button !
That fake old tough guy!

808
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:44,704
You bought your fucking button !

809
00:54:44,872 --> 00:54:47,165
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

810
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:50,126
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

811
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,838
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

812
00:54:54,006 --> 00:54:57,133
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

813
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:59,761
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

814
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,389
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

815
00:55:03,557 --> 00:55:06,017
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's all right.

816
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:10,563
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

817
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:15,360
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

818
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:17,821
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

819
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:21,241
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

820
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,910
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

821
00:55:24,078 --> 00:55:26,162
No, have the drink with me.

822
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:29,332
The drinks are on the house.

823
00:55:31,043 --> 00:55:34,129
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

824
00:55:34,421 --> 00:55:36,464
Fucking break up my party.

825
00:55:43,597 --> 00:55:46,474
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

826
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,977
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

827
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:53,982
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

828
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,818
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

829
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,281
Get the door!

830
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,548
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth !

831
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:20,258
Let's shoot him.

832
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,153
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

833
00:56:40,321 --> 00:56:42,947
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

834
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:49,662
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

835
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:53,458
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

836
00:56:53,626 --> 00:56:56,252
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

837
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,799
Go open your trunk.

838
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,889
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

839
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:21,236
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

840
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:25,615
Look who's here.

841
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:28,785
What did you do? What happened?

842
00:57:28,953 --> 00:57:31,496
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

843
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,831
What happened to him?

844
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:38,753
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

845
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:40,797
You, too. How are you?

846
00:57:40,965 --> 00:57:42,173
Why are you up so late?

847
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:46,678
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

848
00:57:46,845 --> 00:57:50,682
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

849
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:53,601
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

850
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:56,062
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

851
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:57,480
You go inside.

852
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:58,940
This stuff is like lead.

853
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:02,193
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

854
00:58:02,361 --> 00:58:05,071
You haven't called. Where have you been?

855
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:08,157
- I been working nights.
- And?

856
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:10,118
And tonight we were out late.

857
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:13,705
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

858
00:58:13,872 --> 00:58:16,874
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

859
00:58:17,543 --> 00:58:20,712
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

860
00:58:20,879 --> 00:58:22,714
- Okay.
- Just for a while.

861
00:58:22,881 --> 00:58:24,299
The poor thing.

862
00:58:24,466 --> 00:58:28,219
We hit the deer and his paw. . . .
What do you call it?

863
00:58:28,387 --> 00:58:30,013
The paw.

864
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,598
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

865
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:34,600
I got to hack it off.

866
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:37,061
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

867
00:58:37,229 --> 00:58:39,063
I'll bring the knife back.

868
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:41,399
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

869
00:58:41,608 --> 00:58:43,818
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

870
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:45,820
I do, almost every night.

871
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:48,531
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

872
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:53,578
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

873
00:58:53,746 --> 00:58:55,163
Settle down.

874
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:58,541
How's your friend Henry?

875
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:01,085
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

876
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:03,004
Talk. What are you quiet for?

877
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,590
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

878
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:08,259
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

879
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:11,971
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit one another.

880
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:16,934
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

881
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:21,647
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

882
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:25,943
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two- times me?"

883
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:29,864
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

884
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:34,243
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

885
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:35,953
- Cornuto contento.
- That's it.

886
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:39,749
- What does that mean?
- It means he's content to be a jerk.

887
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,835
He doesn't care who knows it.

888
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,797
- Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
- No.

889
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,341
Look at this.

890
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:49,801
It's beautiful.

891
00:59:49,968 --> 00:59:53,054
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

892
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,640
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

893
00:59:55,808 --> 00:59:59,227
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got nice white hair.

894
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,562
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

895
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,731
Looks like somebody we know.

896
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:07,610
Without the beard. It's him.

897
01:00:10,155 --> 01:00:11,447
It's him.

898
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:22,291
What the fuck is that?

899
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:25,044
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

900
01:00:25,212 --> 01:00:27,922
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

901
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:31,342
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

902
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,971
Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

903
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:39,559
Hits became a habit. Guys would get
into arguments over nothing.

904
01:00:39,726 --> 01:00:41,936
Before you knew it, one was dead.

905
01:00:42,104 --> 01:00:44,313
They were shooting each other
aII the time.

906
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:48,025
Shooting people was a normal thing.
lt was no big deal.

907
01:00:49,695 --> 01:00:52,530
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

908
01:00:52,698 --> 01:00:56,826
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

909
01:00:56,994 --> 01:01:00,538
Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and was considered untouchabIe.

910
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,792
Before you touched a made guy,
you had to have a good reason.

911
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,712
You had to have a sit- down
and you'd better get an okay. . .

912
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,214
or you'd be the one who got whacked.

913
01:01:22,394 --> 01:01:24,228
Saturday night was for wives. . .

914
01:01:24,396 --> 01:01:27,565
but Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

915
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:31,652
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

916
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,739
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

917
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:38,409
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

918
01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:42,663
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

919
01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:44,081
What?

920
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:49,212
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

921
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:51,547
So you condone that stuff.

922
01:01:51,715 --> 01:01:53,049
Take it easy.

923
01:01:54,718 --> 01:01:57,595
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

924
01:01:57,763 --> 01:01:59,430
No, I'm not talking about me.

925
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:03,017
But, you know, he's got personality.

926
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:04,644
Personality?

927
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:09,106
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

928
01:02:09,274 --> 01:02:12,610
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

929
01:02:12,778 --> 01:02:15,196
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

930
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,865
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

931
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,076
He's talented. Leave it at that.

932
01:03:58,717 --> 01:04:00,926
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

933
01:04:17,569 --> 01:04:19,862
What did you hear about that thing?

934
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,574
- The Brooklyn thing?
- No, the guy from downtown.

935
01:04:24,242 --> 01:04:27,411
- The guy from where Christie lived?
- No.

936
01:04:28,538 --> 01:04:31,749
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

937
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,418
- Know the guy I mean?
- Yeah.

938
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:38,673
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

939
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,549
Nobody knows what happened to him.

940
01:04:40,717 --> 01:04:44,762
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

941
01:04:46,598 --> 01:04:50,768
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

942
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:53,270
- All right?
- Yeah.

943
01:04:55,774 --> 01:04:57,858
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

944
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,700
I want my money.

945
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:08,160
He owes it.

946
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:19,839
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

947
01:05:20,006 --> 01:05:23,342
- Paulie was talking about that.
- Got to get it out of there.

948
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,637
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

949
01:05:26,805 --> 01:05:30,474
- It's been six months.
- We got to get it out of there right away.

950
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:47,324
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

951
01:05:50,871 --> 01:05:53,122
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny, guys.

952
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,665
Here's a leg.

953
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:56,333
Here's a wing.

954
01:05:57,043 --> 01:06:01,380
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

955
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,508
Oh, that's so bad.

956
01:06:11,308 --> 01:06:13,184
What happened to the car?

957
01:06:13,643 --> 01:06:15,311
I hit a skunk, all right?

958
01:06:15,479 --> 01:06:17,188
Go with your mother.

959
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:20,065
It's disgusting, Henry.

960
01:06:24,196 --> 01:06:27,156
l set up Janice in an apartment
around the corner from The Suite.

961
01:06:27,324 --> 01:06:29,909
That way l was able to stay over
a couple of nights a week.

962
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:31,327
This is my new antique lamp.

963
01:06:31,495 --> 01:06:34,538
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

964
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:36,540
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

965
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:38,334
Looks like Roma.

966
01:06:38,502 --> 01:06:40,753
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

967
01:06:42,756 --> 01:06:44,548
Come see my bedroom.

968
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:49,094
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

969
01:06:53,058 --> 01:06:55,226
Love that crystal ball or what?

970
01:06:56,728 --> 01:06:59,688
This is where we spend most of our time.

971
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:03,776
I love the floral arrangements.

972
01:07:05,779 --> 01:07:06,821
French.

973
01:07:06,988 --> 01:07:10,908
Janice and l were having so much fun,
she started screwing up at work.

974
01:07:11,076 --> 01:07:13,536
l had to straighten out her boss a little bit.

975
01:07:13,703 --> 01:07:17,248
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

976
01:07:17,415 --> 01:07:21,794
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

977
01:07:27,384 --> 01:07:29,593
Come on, get off of her.

978
01:07:29,928 --> 01:07:31,637
You're an animal.

979
01:07:44,609 --> 01:07:48,362
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

980
01:07:50,782 --> 01:07:53,117
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

981
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:56,620
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

982
01:07:56,788 --> 01:07:58,789
Do I stutter? I play those.

983
01:08:02,794 --> 01:08:04,795
What am I? A mirage?

984
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:07,673
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

985
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:10,509
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

986
01:08:10,677 --> 01:08:13,596
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

987
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:16,307
Am I on a pay- no- mind list?

988
01:08:16,474 --> 01:08:20,686
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

989
01:08:20,854 --> 01:08:24,148
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

990
01:08:24,316 --> 01:08:26,400
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

991
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:28,235
You ain't all right.

992
01:08:28,403 --> 01:08:30,571
No, I thought you said you were all right.

993
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,657
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

994
01:08:35,785 --> 01:08:38,871
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

995
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,206
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

996
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:44,001
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

997
01:08:44,169 --> 01:08:46,754
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

998
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:48,505
For everybody else you run.

999
01:08:48,673 --> 01:08:52,676
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1000
01:08:52,844 --> 01:08:54,595
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1001
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:57,389
- Where he played a cowboy.
- The Oklahoma Kid.

1002
01:08:57,557 --> 01:09:01,602
- Shane?
- Oklahoma Kid, that's me!

1003
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,355
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1004
01:09:04,522 --> 01:09:06,523
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1005
01:09:07,025 --> 01:09:09,193
Round up those fucking wagons.

1006
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:16,909
Now he's moving.

1007
01:09:17,869 --> 01:09:20,496
- Henry, what happened?
- He shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1008
01:09:20,664 --> 01:09:24,875
He's fucking fine. So he got shot
in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1009
01:09:25,043 --> 01:09:27,586
- Get a towel.
- Nice fucking game.

1010
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:33,842
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1011
01:09:34,386 --> 01:09:37,054
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1012
01:09:37,472 --> 01:09:39,223
Bones are all shattered.

1013
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:41,183
Don't get me upset, now.

1014
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:44,895
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

1015
01:09:45,063 --> 01:09:47,731
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

1016
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:49,775
It was an accident.

1017
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:52,319
- Little fucking actor.
- I got a great hand here.

1018
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:53,904
- You in or out?
- Yeah, I'm in.

1019
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:55,948
- $800.
- $800?

1020
01:09:56,825 --> 01:10:00,452
You haven't been home in two weeks.
You're not going out tonight!

1021
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:04,081
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

1022
01:10:04,249 --> 01:10:06,125
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1023
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:08,293
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1024
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:10,671
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1025
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,757
- Stop with that. Enough ! Stop with that.
- No!

1026
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:17,636
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying !

1027
01:10:19,889 --> 01:10:22,099
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up.

1028
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:23,392
Get out of my life!

1029
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,520
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

1030
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:29,023
- You're a lousy bastard !
- You got a problem.

1031
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,985
Go ahead, go to your ready- made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1032
01:10:33,236 --> 01:10:36,697
Get out of my life! I can't stand you !

1033
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:49,293
Spider, what's your rush?

1034
01:10:51,838 --> 01:10:53,547
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Spider.

1035
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:57,968
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1036
01:11:00,263 --> 01:11:04,058
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1037
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:05,976
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1038
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:10,731
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

1039
01:11:10,982 --> 01:11:13,192
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

1040
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:15,652
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1041
01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:22,826
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

1042
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:25,496
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1043
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:29,291
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1044
01:11:29,459 --> 01:11:31,919
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

1045
01:11:32,337 --> 01:11:35,923
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1046
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:40,803
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

1047
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:43,555
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

1048
01:11:47,143 --> 01:11:50,187
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

1049
01:11:50,355 --> 01:11:53,607
- How's that, all right?
- What's the fucking matter with you?

1050
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:55,692
What are you, stupid or what?

1051
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,154
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1052
01:11:59,322 --> 01:12:02,282
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

1053
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,952
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

1054
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,328
He's dead.

1055
01:12:07,914 --> 01:12:10,457
Good shot. What do you want from me?
Good shot.

1056
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:11,875
You can't miss at this distance.

1057
01:12:12,043 --> 01:12:13,836
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

1058
01:12:14,003 --> 01:12:15,045
No.

1059
01:12:15,213 --> 01:12:18,924
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1060
01:12:19,092 --> 01:12:21,260
Stupid bastard ! I can't fucking believe you.

1061
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:25,305
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1062
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,643
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1063
01:12:29,936 --> 01:12:32,729
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

1064
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:35,315
- HeIIo.
- Hello?

1065
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:38,068
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1066
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,905
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1067
01:12:42,073 --> 01:12:43,907
l want to talk to you!

1068
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,035
You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1069
01:12:48,246 --> 01:12:50,747
Hello? Open the door!

1070
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,084
Answer me!

1071
01:12:54,627 --> 01:12:57,004
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building. . .

1072
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,882
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1073
01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:01,675
Is this the superintendent?

1074
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:04,219
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore. . .

1075
01:13:04,387 --> 01:13:05,929
living in 2R!

1076
01:13:06,097 --> 01:13:09,224
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1077
01:13:09,684 --> 01:13:11,185
He's my husband!

1078
01:13:11,352 --> 01:13:14,062
Get your own goddamn man!

1079
01:13:15,273 --> 01:13:16,815
Wake up, Henry.

1080
01:13:30,246 --> 01:13:31,955
What are you doing?

1081
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:37,502
- Karen, are you crazy?
- I am crazy.

1082
01:13:38,796 --> 01:13:41,423
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1083
01:13:44,302 --> 01:13:46,094
Karen, take it easy.

1084
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:51,558
- Okay?
- Do you love her?

1085
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:54,311
Do you?

1086
01:13:55,355 --> 01:13:57,439
- Do you?
- Karen. . .

1087
01:13:59,692 --> 01:14:02,152
I love you. You know I love you.

1088
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:05,030
You don't.

1089
01:14:06,574 --> 01:14:08,283
No, you don't.

1090
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:11,620
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1091
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:15,707
But stiII I couIdn't hurt him.
How couId I hurt him?

1092
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,585
l couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1093
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:20,170
The truth was. . .

1094
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:22,631
that no matter how bad I feIt. . .

1095
01:14:23,341 --> 01:14:25,842
l was still very attracted to him.

1096
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:29,346
Why should l give him to someone else?

1097
01:14:29,514 --> 01:14:31,348
Why should she win?

1098
01:14:35,061 --> 01:14:36,937
Just put it down.

1099
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,524
You know I love you, don't you?

1100
01:14:40,775 --> 01:14:42,859
You're all I want, Karen.

1101
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,488
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1102
01:14:47,365 --> 01:14:50,033
Baby, come on.

1103
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:06,341
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1104
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:10,512
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1105
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:14,349
I got to fucking come home for this?

1106
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:16,893
I should fucking kill you !

1107
01:15:18,187 --> 01:15:20,022
How does it feel?

1108
01:15:21,065 --> 01:15:23,025
How does it feel, Karen?

1109
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:41,585
I'm sorry!

1110
01:15:48,593 --> 01:15:50,552
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1111
01:15:51,429 --> 01:15:54,431
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1112
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:57,059
- Hi, Paulie!
- Hi, honey. How are you?

1113
01:15:57,226 --> 01:15:58,185
Good.

1114
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,063
- Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
- Sure.

1115
01:16:01,939 --> 01:16:04,399
- Any of you need anything?
- I'm all right.

1116
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:07,611
- Want anything to drink? A beer?
- No.

1117
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:10,364
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.

1118
01:16:17,121 --> 01:16:19,956
Karen came to the house.
She's very upset.

1119
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:23,418
You gotta straighten this thing out.

1120
01:16:23,586 --> 01:16:26,713
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

1121
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:29,132
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

1122
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:33,178
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1123
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:37,516
I'm not saying you gotta back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

1124
01:16:37,683 --> 01:16:40,143
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

1125
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:42,771
The two of them come over every day,
commiserating.

1126
01:16:42,939 --> 01:16:44,898
I can't have it.

1127
01:16:46,067 --> 01:16:48,402
I can't do it, Henry.

1128
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:51,655
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

1129
01:16:51,823 --> 01:16:54,449
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.

1130
01:16:54,617 --> 01:16:57,369
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

1131
01:16:57,537 --> 01:16:59,871
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

1132
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:02,666
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1133
01:17:02,959 --> 01:17:05,168
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1134
01:17:05,878 --> 01:17:07,421
- All right?
- All right.

1135
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:09,131
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1136
01:17:09,298 --> 01:17:12,843
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1137
01:17:13,344 --> 01:17:15,345
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her. . .

1138
01:17:15,513 --> 01:17:18,390
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married. . .

1139
01:17:18,558 --> 01:17:20,434
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1140
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:22,602
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

1141
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:25,230
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend. . .

1142
01:17:25,398 --> 01:17:26,523
to pick up something for me.

1143
01:17:26,691 --> 01:17:28,400
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1144
01:17:28,568 --> 01:17:29,818
You come with me, we'll go down.

1145
01:17:29,986 --> 01:17:32,529
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1146
01:17:32,697 --> 01:17:34,531
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1147
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:36,533
- We'll have a good time.
- Enjoy yourselves.

1148
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:39,244
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen.

1149
01:17:39,996 --> 01:17:41,705
Please, there's no other way.

1150
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:44,458
You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not animaIi.

1151
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:47,210
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1152
01:17:49,005 --> 01:17:51,882
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1153
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,888
You gonna pay us?

1154
01:18:04,228 --> 01:18:07,272
- You gonna pay?
- Give us the fucking money!

1155
01:18:07,815 --> 01:18:09,858
I can't, I swear.

1156
01:18:11,402 --> 01:18:12,694
Let's go.

1157
01:18:21,245 --> 01:18:23,914
- We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
- No!

1158
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:26,791
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1159
01:18:26,959 --> 01:18:29,294
- Let's throw him over the moat.
- All right.

1160
01:18:29,462 --> 01:18:30,837
I'll get the money!

1161
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:33,632
They must really feed each other
to the Iions down there. . .

1162
01:18:33,799 --> 01:18:35,550
because the guy gave the money right up.

1163
01:18:35,718 --> 01:18:37,344
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1164
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,638
We got to spend the rest of the weekend
at the track.

1165
01:18:40,264 --> 01:18:41,431
Yeah. They mean business.

1166
01:18:41,599 --> 01:18:44,184
Then, l couldn't believe what happened.

1167
01:18:44,602 --> 01:18:47,103
When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

1168
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:50,482
At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up.

1169
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,776
Then I found out
that the guy we roughed up. . .

1170
01:18:52,944 --> 01:18:56,321
turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBl.

1171
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:59,282
Who couId beIieve it?
Of all the fucking people.

1172
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:02,744
She gave up everybody:
Jimmy, me, even her brother.

1173
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:06,998
lt took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

1174
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:10,418
The judge gave Jimmy and me 1 0 years
like he was giving away candy.

1175
01:19:10,586 --> 01:19:13,255
. . .ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1176
01:19:13,464 --> 01:19:17,551
You will now be turned over to
the United States Attorney General's Office.

1177
01:19:21,806 --> 01:19:23,431
Toast, guys.

1178
01:19:23,599 --> 01:19:25,934
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1179
01:19:26,102 --> 01:19:27,978
Good trip, sweetheart.

1180
01:19:30,898 --> 01:19:32,983
We'll watch the home front.

1181
01:19:34,485 --> 01:19:36,945
Say hello to those blow- job hacks.

1182
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:41,157
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1183
01:19:46,998 --> 01:19:49,541
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1184
01:20:01,929 --> 01:20:03,221
Now take me to jail.

1185
01:20:07,893 --> 01:20:10,687
ln prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1186
01:20:11,022 --> 01:20:14,566
We had a pasta course,
and then we had a meat or a fish.

1187
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:18,028
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt. . .

1188
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:20,530
and had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic.

1189
01:20:20,698 --> 01:20:23,700
He used a razor,
and he used to sIice it so thin. . .

1190
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:26,661
that it used to liquefy in the pan
with just a little oil.

1191
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:28,788
lt was a very good system.

1192
01:20:28,956 --> 01:20:31,458
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1193
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,043
Get the smell?

1194
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,920
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1195
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:38,131
veal, beef, and pork.

1196
01:20:38,507 --> 01:20:40,592
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1197
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,302
That's the flavor.

1198
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,930
l felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

1199
01:20:46,098 --> 01:20:48,892
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

1200
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,645
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1201
01:20:51,937 --> 01:20:53,730
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1202
01:20:53,898 --> 01:20:56,441
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

1203
01:20:56,609 --> 01:20:59,361
- I put two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.

1204
01:20:59,528 --> 01:21:01,529
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1205
01:21:01,697 --> 01:21:04,282
We had no broiIer,
so Johnny did everything in pans.

1206
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:06,576
lt used to smell up the joint
something awful. . .

1207
01:21:06,744 --> 01:21:09,704
and the hacks used to die,
but he still cooked a great steak.

1208
01:21:09,872 --> 01:21:12,415
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.

1209
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,126
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1210
01:21:15,544 --> 01:21:19,297
You know, when you think of prison
you get pictures in your mind. . .

1211
01:21:19,465 --> 01:21:23,093
of aII those oId movies
with rows of guys behind bars.

1212
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,178
lt wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1213
01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:28,014
lt really wasn't that bad,
excepting that l missed Jimmy. . .

1214
01:21:28,182 --> 01:21:29,599
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1215
01:21:29,767 --> 01:21:32,268
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

1216
01:21:33,604 --> 01:21:38,066
Everyone else in the joint was doing
real time, mixed together, living like pigs.

1217
01:21:38,234 --> 01:21:41,236
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1218
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:44,781
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1219
01:21:44,949 --> 01:21:46,282
Good, they deserved it.

1220
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:49,953
Even the hacks we couIdn't bribe
would never rat on the guys we did.

1221
01:21:50,121 --> 01:21:51,913
. . . had respect. People loved one another.

1222
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:54,249
- They left their doors open.
- Sorry it took so long.

1223
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:56,918
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

1224
01:21:57,086 --> 01:22:00,296
- We're gonna have to do something.
- I took care of him.

1225
01:22:00,464 --> 01:22:02,173
What'd you bring?

1226
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:03,842
- Bread.
- Good.

1227
01:22:04,135 --> 01:22:06,428
- Fresh.
- Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1228
01:22:06,595 --> 01:22:08,888
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1229
01:22:09,056 --> 01:22:10,557
Come on, what else?

1230
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:12,225
- Scotch.
- Nice.

1231
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,061
- Some red wine.
- Okay.

1232
01:22:15,396 --> 01:22:17,272
- Now we can eat.
- I got some white, too.

1233
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,190
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1234
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:22,360
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1235
01:22:22,945 --> 01:22:24,028
Some more bread.

1236
01:22:24,196 --> 01:22:26,865
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1237
01:22:27,032 --> 01:22:29,117
- You must be kidding.
- Believe me.

1238
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:40,003
What are you doing?

1239
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:47,010
I'll take that.

1240
01:22:49,388 --> 01:22:51,848
- All right, I'll catch you guys later.
- Yeah.

1241
01:22:52,016 --> 01:22:54,350
You going for a walk in the park?

1242
01:22:55,853 --> 01:22:59,022
- Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
- Okay.

1243
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:04,402
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1244
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,570
- Thanks.
- You too, Henry.

1245
01:23:14,497 --> 01:23:15,622
Mrs. Hill, come here.

1246
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:16,956
Come on.

1247
01:23:20,336 --> 01:23:22,378
You girls stay right here.

1248
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:26,049
- I want you to hold hands.
- Okay, go right up to the front.

1249
01:23:26,383 --> 01:23:28,301
- Let's go.
- How you doing?

1250
01:23:28,469 --> 01:23:30,887
- Good, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

1251
01:23:42,942 --> 01:23:45,527
- What you talking about?
- I saw her name in the register.

1252
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:47,737
- Jesus Christ.
- You want her to visit you?

1253
01:23:47,905 --> 01:23:51,574
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

1254
01:23:51,742 --> 01:23:54,911
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1255
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:57,288
I can't stop people from coming to see me.

1256
01:23:57,456 --> 01:24:00,750
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

1257
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:05,547
- Let her fight these bastards every week!
- Look what you're doing ! Stop it!

1258
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:08,258
I'm sorry.

1259
01:24:08,759 --> 01:24:11,219
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1260
01:24:12,263 --> 01:24:14,097
Will you stop it, Karen?

1261
01:24:14,557 --> 01:24:17,100
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!

1262
01:24:25,276 --> 01:24:28,653
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1263
01:24:29,613 --> 01:24:31,614
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1264
01:24:32,032 --> 01:24:35,243
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

1265
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:36,786
You know what he told me?

1266
01:24:36,954 --> 01:24:40,540
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1267
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,667
It's gonna be okay.

1268
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:46,963
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1269
01:24:47,131 --> 01:24:49,924
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

1270
01:24:50,092 --> 01:24:54,095
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1271
01:24:55,097 --> 01:24:59,100
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1272
01:25:01,562 --> 01:25:03,813
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1273
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:06,566
All I need is for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1274
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,319
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

1275
01:25:09,486 --> 01:25:11,112
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1276
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,698
- We won't need anybody.
- I'm afraid.

1277
01:25:13,866 --> 01:25:15,825
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out. . . .

1278
01:25:15,993 --> 01:25:17,285
Don't worry about him.

1279
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:20,997
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

1280
01:25:22,166 --> 01:25:23,625
We've gotta help each other.

1281
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:27,462
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

1282
01:25:32,134 --> 01:25:34,344
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

1283
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:35,511
Never.

1284
01:26:00,913 --> 01:26:02,580
Daddy!

1285
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,459
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

1286
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:10,213
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1287
01:26:10,381 --> 01:26:11,798
I did the sun.

1288
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:15,885
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1289
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,554
Do you like the house?

1290
01:26:19,848 --> 01:26:21,891
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

1291
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:23,101
With what?

1292
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:26,396
Don't worry, with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

1293
01:26:26,563 --> 01:26:29,983
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $1 5,000.

1294
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:32,068
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1295
01:26:32,236 --> 01:26:34,904
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

1296
01:26:35,072 --> 01:26:37,991
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1297
01:26:38,701 --> 01:26:41,077
- Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
- Me!

1298
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,964
What do you want?

1299
01:26:53,215 --> 01:26:55,258
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1300
01:26:58,721 --> 01:27:01,597
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1301
01:27:03,726 --> 01:27:05,601
I don't want any more of that shit.

1302
01:27:05,769 --> 01:27:06,769
What shit?

1303
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:09,522
- Just stay away from the garbage.
- Look, Paulie- -

1304
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:12,900
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

1305
01:27:13,068 --> 01:27:15,611
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

1306
01:27:16,655 --> 01:27:19,407
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk out of me.

1307
01:27:19,575 --> 01:27:21,117
Just don't do it.

1308
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:27,832
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

1309
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,752
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

1310
01:27:30,919 --> 01:27:33,379
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

1311
01:27:33,547 --> 01:27:35,298
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1312
01:27:35,466 --> 01:27:37,216
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

1313
01:27:37,384 --> 01:27:39,010
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1314
01:27:39,178 --> 01:27:41,804
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

1315
01:27:41,972 --> 01:27:44,474
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

1316
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:48,978
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1317
01:27:49,313 --> 01:27:53,191
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1318
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:56,277
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck. . .

1319
01:27:56,445 --> 01:27:58,529
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

1320
01:27:58,697 --> 01:28:01,157
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

1321
01:28:01,325 --> 01:28:03,451
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

1322
01:28:03,619 --> 01:28:05,620
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

1323
01:28:05,788 --> 01:28:09,665
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1324
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:10,958
That means anybody.

1325
01:28:11,126 --> 01:28:12,126
- All right.
- Yeah?

1326
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:13,795
Yeah. Of course.

1327
01:28:21,386 --> 01:28:25,348
Took me about a week of sneaking around
before l could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1328
01:28:25,516 --> 01:28:27,975
But when I did, it was a reaI score.

1329
01:28:28,143 --> 01:28:30,686
l started using Sandy's place
to mix the stuff.

1330
01:28:30,854 --> 01:28:33,272
And even with Sandy snorting
more than she mixed. . .

1331
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,067
I couId see that
this was a really good business.

1332
01:28:36,235 --> 01:28:38,653
I made $1 2,000 in my second week.

1333
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:42,323
l had a down payment on my house
and things were really rolling.

1334
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:46,702
All l had to do was every once in a while
tell Sandy that l loved her.

1335
01:28:50,332 --> 01:28:52,375
But it was perfect, l'm telling you.

1336
01:28:52,543 --> 01:28:54,919
As long as l kept getting
the stuff from Pittsburgh. . .

1337
01:28:55,087 --> 01:28:56,796
I knew PauIie wouId never find out.

1338
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:00,883
Within a couple of weeks,
it got so big l needed some help.

1339
01:29:01,218 --> 01:29:04,011
So l got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1340
01:29:04,388 --> 01:29:05,930
It's fucking great.

1341
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:07,390
Mr. Conway.

1342
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:15,148
- Bring your pay slips?
- Yeah.

1343
01:29:18,235 --> 01:29:20,570
Four and a half months of dirt.

1344
01:29:21,738 --> 01:29:23,698
- It's so good.
- I did it.

1345
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:27,451
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

1346
01:29:27,911 --> 01:29:31,664
And this we just had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1347
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:34,375
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1348
01:29:34,585 --> 01:29:36,085
Okay, you ready?

1349
01:29:36,253 --> 01:29:38,421
Watch the wall with the rock.

1350
01:29:46,054 --> 01:29:48,848
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1351
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:51,767
Come on. All right.

1352
01:29:51,935 --> 01:29:55,563
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1353
01:29:55,731 --> 01:29:57,064
It's nice, huh?

1354
01:29:57,232 --> 01:29:59,275
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

1355
01:29:59,443 --> 01:30:01,903
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

1356
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:05,281
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

1357
01:30:05,449 --> 01:30:07,700
- Come on.
- He's gonna do it, right?

1358
01:30:07,868 --> 01:30:09,619
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1359
01:30:09,786 --> 01:30:12,455
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1360
01:30:12,623 --> 01:30:16,792
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been. . .

1361
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,588
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

1362
01:30:20,797 --> 01:30:23,841
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1363
01:30:24,009 --> 01:30:27,887
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1364
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:30,139
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1365
01:30:30,807 --> 01:30:33,559
These are the guys that Jimmy
put together for what turned out to be. . .

1366
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:37,605
the biggest heist in American history:
the Lufthansa heist.

1367
01:30:38,857 --> 01:30:41,567
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab
the outside guard. . .

1368
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:44,237
and make him get us in the front door.

1369
01:30:45,489 --> 01:30:48,783
Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

1370
01:30:49,326 --> 01:30:53,496
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
all tied up and away from the alarms.

1371
01:30:54,122 --> 01:30:56,332
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1372
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:00,002
He used to hang around the lounge
and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.

1373
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:02,630
What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck. . .

1374
01:31:02,798 --> 01:31:05,925
and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours out in Jersey.

1375
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:08,469
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1376
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:10,638
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1377
01:31:10,806 --> 01:31:13,849
Just because he set this up,
he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls. . .

1378
01:31:14,017 --> 01:31:16,560
for an advance on the money
we were going to steal.

1379
01:31:16,728 --> 01:31:20,356
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.

1380
01:31:27,197 --> 01:31:31,325
l had everybody working for me.
Even our old baby- sitter, Lois Byrd.

1381
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:35,705
Did you have a good flight?

1382
01:31:35,872 --> 01:31:38,374
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

1383
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:40,584
Come on, they're not that bad.

1384
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:43,587
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1385
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,340
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1386
01:31:46,508 --> 01:31:49,593
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1387
01:31:50,554 --> 01:31:51,721
Big yawn.

1388
01:31:51,888 --> 01:31:53,639
She looks just like you.

1389
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:56,642
That's what the stewardess said.

1390
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:11,240
Take it easy, Sandy.

1391
01:32:11,408 --> 01:32:14,118
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

1392
01:32:14,286 --> 01:32:17,621
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1393
01:32:18,081 --> 01:32:19,915
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?

1394
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:24,170
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1395
01:32:25,464 --> 01:32:26,839
Over there.

1396
01:32:27,007 --> 01:32:28,716
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1397
01:32:28,884 --> 01:32:30,926
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

1398
01:32:31,094 --> 01:32:32,887
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1399
01:32:33,055 --> 01:32:34,764
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

1400
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:38,100
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

1401
01:32:38,268 --> 01:32:40,478
- Loosen up.
- What are you doing?

1402
01:32:41,605 --> 01:32:44,940
- You know, I gotta. . . .
- You don't have to go anywhere.

1403
01:32:46,109 --> 01:32:47,610
Make them wait.

1404
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,664
Nobody knows for sure just how much
was taken in the daring pre- dawn raid. . .

1405
01:33:00,832 --> 01:33:03,459
at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.

1406
01:33:03,627 --> 01:33:07,338
The FBI says $2 miIIion,
Port Authority PoIice say $4 miIIion- -

1407
01:33:10,675 --> 01:33:12,760
Jimmy!

1408
01:33:12,928 --> 01:33:14,762
Those sons of bitches!

1409
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:17,264
. . .from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1410
01:33:17,432 --> 01:33:21,060
lt looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.

1411
01:33:22,979 --> 01:33:25,147
Come here, you ! Come here!

1412
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:28,901
Look at this genius. This genius!

1413
01:33:33,323 --> 01:33:34,990
Merry Christmas.

1414
01:33:39,746 --> 01:33:42,164
- Hello, who's this?
- That's my wife.

1415
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:46,419
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1416
01:33:49,131 --> 01:33:50,506
Isn't she gorgeous?

1417
01:33:50,674 --> 01:33:53,843
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

1418
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:59,515
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

1419
01:33:59,683 --> 01:34:01,016
Didn't I say what was going on?

1420
01:34:01,184 --> 01:34:03,269
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

1421
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:06,439
- The fucking car?
- It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1422
01:34:06,606 --> 01:34:08,732
It's under her name. I just got married.

1423
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,694
- I love that car.
- Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1424
01:34:11,862 --> 01:34:14,155
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

1425
01:34:14,322 --> 01:34:16,949
- What are you getting excited for?
- Are you stupid?

1426
01:34:17,117 --> 01:34:19,618
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

1427
01:34:19,786 --> 01:34:21,662
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1428
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,873
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1429
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,083
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1430
01:34:26,251 --> 01:34:28,210
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

1431
01:34:28,378 --> 01:34:32,089
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

1432
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:33,841
What are you getting excited for?

1433
01:34:34,009 --> 01:34:37,386
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1434
01:34:37,554 --> 01:34:40,264
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.

1435
01:34:41,725 --> 01:34:44,935
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

1436
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:48,564
I'm sorry.

1437
01:34:51,067 --> 01:34:54,570
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

1438
01:34:55,238 --> 01:34:57,907
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

1439
01:34:58,074 --> 01:35:00,993
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?

1440
01:35:01,411 --> 01:35:04,413
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1441
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:06,207
Don't buy anything !

1442
01:35:06,374 --> 01:35:07,958
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1443
01:35:11,213 --> 01:35:13,631
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1444
01:35:21,097 --> 01:35:23,432
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

1445
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,934
Excuse me.

1446
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:26,852
- What's the matter?
- Take it off.

1447
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,980
- Why? What's the matter?
- Take it off!

1448
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:35,694
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

1449
01:35:35,862 --> 01:35:38,948
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1450
01:35:39,115 --> 01:35:40,991
- Bring it fucking back.
- I'll bring it back.

1451
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:44,662
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

1452
01:35:44,829 --> 01:35:47,581
- Get it out of here!
- All right. Let's go, honey.

1453
01:35:51,795 --> 01:35:53,963
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

1454
01:35:56,967 --> 01:35:59,552
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1455
01:36:01,471 --> 01:36:05,641
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1456
01:36:05,809 --> 01:36:10,020
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1457
01:36:10,272 --> 01:36:11,730
That's great.

1458
01:36:11,898 --> 01:36:14,984
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

1459
01:36:18,029 --> 01:36:19,905
I've been looking all over for you.

1460
01:36:20,073 --> 01:36:21,657
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1461
01:36:21,825 --> 01:36:23,826
Listen, I need the money.

1462
01:36:24,244 --> 01:36:27,705
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- Jimmy, I need the money.

1463
01:36:27,872 --> 01:36:30,040
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1464
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:33,127
- I did what I had to do. I need the money.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1465
01:36:33,295 --> 01:36:37,381
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1466
01:36:37,549 --> 01:36:40,217
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1467
01:36:40,385 --> 01:36:43,679
- Just not tonight.
- They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1468
01:36:46,182 --> 01:36:48,726
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1469
01:36:48,893 --> 01:36:51,353
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

1470
01:36:51,521 --> 01:36:54,148
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

1471
01:36:54,316 --> 01:36:56,400
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.

1472
01:36:56,568 --> 01:36:59,486
- Morris, baby, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

1473
01:37:05,201 --> 01:37:08,579
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1474
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:13,125
We did it!

1475
01:37:16,129 --> 01:37:17,838
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

1476
01:37:18,465 --> 01:37:20,382
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's me.

1477
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:22,176
Pete? One second.

1478
01:37:22,969 --> 01:37:25,596
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1479
01:37:25,764 --> 01:37:27,389
- Do what's right, understand?
- Yeah.

1480
01:37:29,434 --> 01:37:31,393
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1481
01:37:31,895 --> 01:37:34,647
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1482
01:37:36,066 --> 01:37:39,735
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.

1483
01:37:39,903 --> 01:37:41,528
I love the gold outfit.

1484
01:37:41,696 --> 01:37:43,405
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

1485
01:37:43,573 --> 01:37:44,948
- What?
- Merry Christmas.

1486
01:37:45,116 --> 01:37:46,408
And?

1487
01:37:46,826 --> 01:37:48,369
Happy Hanukkah.

1488
01:37:49,245 --> 01:37:52,498
- Very funny.
- Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1489
01:38:00,799 --> 01:38:05,177
Lufthansa shouId have been
our uItimate score. The heist of a Iifetime.

1490
01:38:05,762 --> 01:38:09,014
$6 million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1491
01:38:19,025 --> 01:38:20,442
Yo, Stacks!

1492
01:38:20,819 --> 01:38:23,445
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1493
01:38:29,744 --> 01:38:33,622
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1494
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:37,042
- You didn't bring any coffee?
- What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1495
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:40,129
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1496
01:38:43,174 --> 01:38:45,300
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

1497
01:38:45,468 --> 01:38:47,845
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1498
01:38:48,847 --> 01:38:51,849
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

1499
01:38:52,016 --> 01:38:53,225
What time is it?

1500
01:38:53,393 --> 01:38:57,354
- It's 1 1 :30. We had to be there by 9:00.
- I'll be ready in a minute.

1501
01:38:57,522 --> 01:39:01,400
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1502
01:39:06,364 --> 01:39:10,325
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1503
01:39:13,455 --> 01:39:15,330
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1504
01:39:15,498 --> 01:39:18,375
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

1505
01:39:38,188 --> 01:39:40,147
Stacks was always crazy.

1506
01:39:40,482 --> 01:39:44,151
lnstead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned. . .

1507
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:48,864
went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1508
01:39:49,032 --> 01:39:51,116
It was aII over the teIevision.

1509
01:39:51,284 --> 01:39:54,286
They even said they came up
with prints off the wheel.

1510
01:39:54,996 --> 01:39:58,457
lt was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1511
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:12,012
I gotta talk to you.

1512
01:40:12,222 --> 01:40:14,848
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.

1513
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:19,144
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1514
01:40:20,438 --> 01:40:22,523
I still gotta talk to you.

1515
01:40:22,857 --> 01:40:23,857
What?

1516
01:40:24,025 --> 01:40:26,527
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

1517
01:40:26,694 --> 01:40:30,447
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they gonna go?

1518
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:33,534
- It's in the papers.
- He's worried.

1519
01:40:34,035 --> 01:40:35,244
What are you worried about?

1520
01:40:35,912 --> 01:40:39,373
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1521
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:42,751
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.

1522
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:45,712
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

1523
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,257
- Didn't you tell him?
- I didn't tell him yet.

1524
01:40:48,424 --> 01:40:49,883
- What?
- Guess what?

1525
01:40:51,427 --> 01:40:53,095
They're gonna make him.

1526
01:40:54,764 --> 01:40:56,723
Paulie's going to make you?

1527
01:40:57,517 --> 01:40:58,642
Tommy.

1528
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:01,311
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1529
01:41:01,521 --> 01:41:04,273
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

1530
01:41:05,191 --> 01:41:09,611
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1531
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:12,281
I can't believe it.

1532
01:41:12,448 --> 01:41:14,616
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

1533
01:41:14,784 --> 01:41:16,785
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1534
01:41:17,579 --> 01:41:21,832
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

1535
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:24,960
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

1536
01:41:25,128 --> 01:41:28,505
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him ! I want my money.

1537
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,966
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1538
01:41:31,134 --> 01:41:33,468
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1539
01:41:33,636 --> 01:41:36,430
- Fuck him ! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

1540
01:41:39,142 --> 01:41:41,977
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what?

1541
01:41:43,605 --> 01:41:45,480
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1542
01:41:45,648 --> 01:41:48,108
You just got to stop busting balls.

1543
01:41:48,484 --> 01:41:51,320
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

1544
01:41:51,529 --> 01:41:53,739
Everything's going to be fine.

1545
01:41:59,829 --> 01:42:00,871
Henry.

1546
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:10,005
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1547
01:42:52,382 --> 01:42:55,634
I couId see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1548
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:58,971
His mind was going in
eight different directions at once.

1549
01:43:01,265 --> 01:43:03,725
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1550
01:43:04,018 --> 01:43:05,394
Morrie? Him?

1551
01:43:05,979 --> 01:43:08,855
That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1552
01:43:09,023 --> 01:43:13,360
That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1553
01:43:14,028 --> 01:43:16,405
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1554
01:43:16,572 --> 01:43:20,075
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1555
01:43:20,243 --> 01:43:23,412
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1556
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:26,248
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1557
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:28,041
- Okay?
- All right.

1558
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:33,338
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1559
01:43:33,506 --> 01:43:35,465
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1560
01:43:35,633 --> 01:43:37,509
l was just stalling for time.

1561
01:43:38,261 --> 01:43:42,347
I knew I stiII had tiII 8:00 or 9:00
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1562
01:43:42,557 --> 01:43:46,601
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
l was going along with the program.

1563
01:43:46,769 --> 01:43:50,522
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head.
I bit him. He's out cold.

1564
01:43:52,608 --> 01:43:54,901
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1565
01:43:55,069 --> 01:43:57,988
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

1566
01:43:58,364 --> 01:44:01,199
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

1567
01:44:02,118 --> 01:44:03,910
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1568
01:44:04,078 --> 01:44:07,497
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says. . . .

1569
01:44:08,958 --> 01:44:10,792
I said, "Don't say it."

1570
01:44:15,715 --> 01:44:17,049
"Jerkoff!"

1571
01:44:19,802 --> 01:44:23,305
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

1572
01:44:23,473 --> 01:44:26,475
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1573
01:44:26,642 --> 01:44:28,351
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1574
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:31,521
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1575
01:44:31,689 --> 01:44:34,649
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1576
01:44:34,817 --> 01:44:37,402
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1577
01:44:38,237 --> 01:44:40,280
lt was a load off my mind.

1578
01:44:41,365 --> 01:44:42,574
Poor bastard.

1579
01:44:42,742 --> 01:44:44,993
He never knew how cIose he'd come
to getting killed.

1580
01:44:45,161 --> 01:44:48,080
Even if I toId him,
he wouId have never beIieved me.

1581
01:44:49,832 --> 01:44:53,835
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1582
01:44:54,462 --> 01:44:57,672
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

1583
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,842
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

1584
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:03,011
Who loves you more than I do?

1585
01:45:03,179 --> 01:45:06,515
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except to stop busting my balls.

1586
01:45:07,433 --> 01:45:09,851
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?

1587
01:45:10,019 --> 01:45:12,270
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1588
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:15,899
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1589
01:45:16,067 --> 01:45:18,193
- They got Danishes?
- They got everything.

1590
01:45:18,361 --> 01:45:20,654
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1591
01:45:21,197 --> 01:45:25,992
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio- -

1592
01:45:33,709 --> 01:45:35,210
I thought he'd never shut up.

1593
01:45:35,378 --> 01:45:37,087
What a pain in the ass.

1594
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:40,048
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1595
01:45:40,216 --> 01:45:42,175
Call me when you're through.

1596
01:45:42,343 --> 01:45:44,761
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.

1597
01:45:44,929 --> 01:45:47,472
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1598
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,682
You said chop him up.

1599
01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:52,185
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

1600
01:45:53,187 --> 01:45:55,814
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1601
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:58,066
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1602
01:45:58,234 --> 01:45:59,985
The car's cold.

1603
01:46:00,153 --> 01:46:03,738
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1604
01:46:04,574 --> 01:46:07,033
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

1605
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:08,910
It's Belle. Let me in.

1606
01:46:09,745 --> 01:46:13,582
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1607
01:46:13,749 --> 01:46:15,083
Calm down.

1608
01:46:15,376 --> 01:46:17,794
He's missing ! I know something happened.

1609
01:46:17,962 --> 01:46:20,172
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

1610
01:46:20,339 --> 01:46:24,009
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

1611
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:26,928
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

1612
01:46:27,096 --> 01:46:30,765
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

1613
01:46:31,142 --> 01:46:34,436
- I've been home! I've been on the phone- - 
- He's playing cards.

1614
01:46:37,607 --> 01:46:40,108
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?

1615
01:46:40,985 --> 01:46:44,446
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1616
01:46:44,614 --> 01:46:46,656
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.

1617
01:46:46,824 --> 01:46:48,783
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

1618
01:46:48,951 --> 01:46:51,786
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1619
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:56,625
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1620
01:46:57,919 --> 01:46:59,628
Keep them up all night.

1621
01:47:00,546 --> 01:47:02,130
I'll see you later.

1622
01:47:51,806 --> 01:47:54,975
Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery. . .

1623
01:47:55,142 --> 01:47:57,519
but it had nothing to do with me.

1624
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:11,366
l gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1625
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,495
From then on, l kept my mouth shut.

1626
01:48:15,663 --> 01:48:19,541
l knew Jimmy. He had the cash. lt was his.

1627
01:48:19,709 --> 01:48:23,044
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1628
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:27,590
lt made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1629
01:48:27,758 --> 01:48:30,593
He'd rather whack them.
Anyway, what did l care?

1630
01:48:30,761 --> 01:48:32,595
l wasn't asking for anything.

1631
01:48:32,763 --> 01:48:36,391
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1632
01:48:36,934 --> 01:48:41,021
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1633
01:49:03,044 --> 01:49:05,754
When they found Carbone
in the meat truck. . .

1634
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:07,589
he was frozen so stiff. . .

1635
01:49:07,757 --> 01:49:10,884
it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1636
01:49:15,723 --> 01:49:17,849
Still, l never saw Jimmy so happy.

1637
01:49:18,267 --> 01:49:21,853
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh people. . .

1638
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:25,565
and even after a whiIe,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1639
01:49:25,733 --> 01:49:27,901
What made Jimmy so happy
that morning. . .

1640
01:49:28,069 --> 01:49:30,945
was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.

1641
01:49:31,447 --> 01:49:34,449
Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1642
01:49:35,076 --> 01:49:37,702
He must have made four caIIs
to Tommy's house.

1643
01:49:37,912 --> 01:49:41,831
They had a signal set up, so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

1644
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:44,959
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

1645
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:48,129
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

1646
01:49:48,589 --> 01:49:51,132
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

1647
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,677
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1648
01:49:55,346 --> 01:49:58,681
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1649
01:49:58,849 --> 01:50:00,475
- God be with you.
- Bye, Ma.

1650
01:50:00,643 --> 01:50:02,977
We always called each other goodfellas.

1651
01:50:03,145 --> 01:50:04,771
You'd say to somebody:

1652
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:09,150
"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us."

1653
01:50:09,485 --> 01:50:10,860
You understand?

1654
01:50:11,529 --> 01:50:13,863
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1655
01:50:16,325 --> 01:50:19,702
But Jimmy and l could never be made
because we had Irish bIood.

1656
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:22,330
lt didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1657
01:50:22,581 --> 01:50:26,501
To become a member of a crew,
you've got to be 1 00% ltalian. . .

1658
01:50:26,669 --> 01:50:29,879
so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1659
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:39,347
lt's the highest honor they can give you.

1660
01:50:39,515 --> 01:50:42,016
lt means you belong
to a family and a crew.

1661
01:50:42,393 --> 01:50:44,936
lt means nobody can fuck around
with you.

1662
01:50:45,479 --> 01:50:47,856
lt also means you could
fuck around with anybody. . .

1663
01:50:48,023 --> 01:50:50,483
just as long as they aren't also a member.

1664
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:54,070
It's Iike a Iicense to steaI.
A license to do anything.

1665
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,241
How many years ago
since you were made?

1666
01:50:58,409 --> 01:51:01,161
- I'm an old- timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?

1667
01:51:01,328 --> 01:51:05,582
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1668
01:51:08,878 --> 01:51:11,838
As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made. . .

1669
01:51:12,006 --> 01:51:14,382
it was like we were all being made.

1670
01:51:15,259 --> 01:51:17,802
We wouId now have
one of our own as a member.

1671
01:51:33,777 --> 01:51:35,403
- Who's this?
- This is Vinnie.

1672
01:51:35,571 --> 01:51:38,406
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1673
01:51:38,574 --> 01:51:41,576
No, we had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.

1674
01:51:41,744 --> 01:51:42,744
What do you mean?

1675
01:51:42,912 --> 01:51:47,081
You know what l mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1676
01:51:48,959 --> 01:51:50,835
- That's it.
- What do you mean?

1677
01:51:51,003 --> 01:51:52,378
He's gone.

1678
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:55,381
That's it.

1679
01:52:00,262 --> 01:52:03,097
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1680
01:52:13,484 --> 01:52:15,610
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.

1681
01:52:15,778 --> 01:52:16,945
Fuck.

1682
01:52:32,795 --> 01:52:34,462
Are you all right?

1683
01:52:41,512 --> 01:52:44,013
lt was revenge for Billy Batts. . .

1684
01:52:44,181 --> 01:52:45,974
and a lot of other things.

1685
01:52:46,141 --> 01:52:47,141
And that's that.

1686
01:52:47,309 --> 01:52:49,811
There was nothing we could do about it.

1687
01:52:49,979 --> 01:52:52,605
Batts was a made man
and Tommy wasn't.

1688
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:55,149
We had to sit stiII and take it.

1689
01:52:55,317 --> 01:52:58,736
lt was among the ltalians.
lt was real greaseball shit.

1690
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:13,209
They even shot Tommy in the face. . .

1691
01:53:13,377 --> 01:53:16,838
so his mother couldn't give him
an open coffin at the funeral.

1692
01:54:04,345 --> 01:54:07,639
l was gonna be busy all day.
l had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's. . .

1693
01:54:07,806 --> 01:54:09,557
to match some siIencers he had.

1694
01:54:09,725 --> 01:54:12,727
l had to pick up my brother at the hospital
and drive him home.

1695
01:54:12,895 --> 01:54:15,396
l had to pick up
some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois. . .

1696
01:54:15,564 --> 01:54:18,733
to fly down to some customers
I had near AtIanta.

1697
01:54:30,037 --> 01:54:33,498
Right away, l knew he didn't want them,
and l'd be stuck for the money.

1698
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:37,377
l only bought them because
he wanted them, and now he didn't.

1699
01:54:38,087 --> 01:54:41,589
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

1700
01:54:41,757 --> 01:54:43,091
I'm not paying for it.

1701
01:54:43,258 --> 01:54:46,928
l didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.

1702
01:54:47,096 --> 01:54:49,263
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush !

1703
01:54:49,431 --> 01:54:50,848
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.

1704
01:55:04,488 --> 01:55:06,447
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.

1705
01:55:06,615 --> 01:55:10,201
Since l would see them in the afternoon
to pick up a delivery. . .

1706
01:55:10,369 --> 01:55:12,954
l was pretty sure l'd get my money back.

1707
01:55:31,974 --> 01:55:32,974
Oh, my God.

1708
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:38,855
When l finally got to the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1709
01:55:39,022 --> 01:55:41,149
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1710
01:55:42,192 --> 01:55:44,569
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1711
01:55:44,737 --> 01:55:47,655
And l told him l was partying all night.

1712
01:55:47,823 --> 01:55:49,615
- I'm fine.
- Come on. Get over here.

1713
01:55:49,783 --> 01:55:51,868
- Doc, I'm fine.
- Let me check you out.

1714
01:55:52,369 --> 01:55:53,536
Come on.

1715
01:55:56,582 --> 01:55:59,250
He took mercy on me,
gave me 1 0 milligrams of Valium. . .

1716
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:00,501
and sent me home.

1717
01:56:01,211 --> 01:56:04,964
My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1718
01:56:07,009 --> 01:56:10,219
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1719
01:56:10,387 --> 01:56:13,723
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1720
01:56:13,891 --> 01:56:16,726
- Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
- I'm telling you.

1721
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:18,102
I don't know what's going on.

1722
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:21,314
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1723
01:56:21,482 --> 01:56:23,858
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1724
01:56:24,026 --> 01:56:26,444
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1725
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:35,036
l was cooking dinner that night.

1726
01:56:36,163 --> 01:56:39,832
l had to start braising the beef
and veaI shanks for the tomato sauce.

1727
01:56:42,503 --> 01:56:45,713
It was MichaeI's favorite.
l was making ziti with meat gravy. . .

1728
01:56:45,881 --> 01:56:48,382
and l'm planning to roast some peppers
over the fIames. . .

1729
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:52,512
put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautifuI cutIets. . .

1730
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:53,721
that were cut just right. . .

1731
01:56:53,889 --> 01:56:56,891
that l was going to fry up as an appetizer.

1732
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,060
So, l was home for about an hour.

1733
01:56:59,269 --> 01:57:01,229
My plan was to start the dinner early. . .

1734
01:57:01,396 --> 01:57:03,940
so Karen and l could unload the guns
Jimmy didn't want. . .

1735
01:57:04,107 --> 01:57:05,525
then get the package for Lois. . .

1736
01:57:05,692 --> 01:57:08,236
to take to Atlanta for her trip
later that night.

1737
01:57:09,112 --> 01:57:12,907
l kept looking out the window,
and l saw that the helicopter was gone.

1738
01:57:13,534 --> 01:57:17,036
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1739
01:57:18,163 --> 01:57:21,916
So l asked my brother to watch the sauce,
and Karen and I started out.

1740
01:57:24,837 --> 01:57:26,921
Oh, God. I see it.

1741
01:57:27,172 --> 01:57:29,674
- I see it. Look, it's right there.
- Damn !

1742
01:57:30,884 --> 01:57:32,301
- That's it.
- There it is.

1743
01:57:32,469 --> 01:57:34,095
We got to get to your mother's.

1744
01:57:34,721 --> 01:57:35,972
See, I told you.

1745
01:57:36,181 --> 01:57:37,557
It's funny.

1746
01:57:37,933 --> 01:57:40,935
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.

1747
01:58:09,464 --> 01:58:13,175
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

1748
01:58:13,343 --> 01:58:16,095
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

1749
01:58:21,643 --> 01:58:23,311
Let's go shopping.

1750
01:58:25,564 --> 01:58:27,690
I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

1751
01:58:28,859 --> 01:58:29,984
I'm telling you.

1752
01:58:30,986 --> 01:58:34,238
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid !

1753
01:58:35,324 --> 01:58:38,701
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1754
01:58:40,704 --> 01:58:42,580
Come on, let's go inside.

1755
01:58:46,668 --> 01:58:48,628
- Yeah, it's gone.
- I don't hear anything.

1756
01:58:48,795 --> 01:58:50,087
Let's go back to your mother's.

1757
01:59:03,977 --> 01:59:06,520
- They all right?
- Beautiful. They're great.

1758
01:59:07,356 --> 01:59:10,024
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1759
01:59:10,192 --> 01:59:11,692
Yeah. I need a hit.

1760
01:59:12,277 --> 01:59:15,279
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1761
01:59:15,906 --> 01:59:18,366
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1762
01:59:19,409 --> 01:59:23,746
l had to get home and get the package
ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1763
01:59:23,914 --> 01:59:27,792
Also, l had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1764
01:59:28,126 --> 01:59:30,378
Plus, l knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1765
01:59:30,545 --> 01:59:34,256
l had the cooking to finish,
and l had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1766
01:59:34,424 --> 01:59:36,968
- It's Sandy. What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

1767
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,388
- When are you coming over?
- In an hour.

1768
01:59:40,555 --> 01:59:43,557
- You staying tonight, right?
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1769
01:59:43,892 --> 01:59:47,979
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1770
01:59:55,612 --> 01:59:57,613
- Hello?
- lt's me. You ready?

1771
01:59:58,615 --> 02:00:01,450
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

1772
02:00:02,035 --> 02:00:05,871
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

1773
02:00:06,039 --> 02:00:07,873
- Listen, you know what to do?
- Yeah, yeah.

1774
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:10,251
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

1775
02:00:10,419 --> 02:00:12,878
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1776
02:00:13,046 --> 02:00:16,215
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1777
02:00:16,383 --> 02:00:20,052
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1778
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:22,763
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1779
02:00:22,931 --> 02:00:23,973
You can be such a pain.

1780
02:00:24,141 --> 02:00:28,269
- Hey! Just do it!
- Okay.

1781
02:00:28,854 --> 02:00:33,399
Un- fucking- believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1782
02:00:34,735 --> 02:00:36,861
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

1783
02:00:37,029 --> 02:00:39,321
What does she do
after she hangs up with me?

1784
02:00:39,489 --> 02:00:42,992
After everything l told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?

1785
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,786
She picks up the phone
and caIIs from the house.

1786
02:00:45,954 --> 02:00:48,289
lf anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.

1787
02:00:48,457 --> 02:00:50,374
They'd know a package
was leaving my house. . .

1788
02:00:50,542 --> 02:00:53,794
and they'd even have the time and
flight number, thanks to her.

1789
02:00:54,963 --> 02:00:57,631
As soon as l got home, l started cooking.

1790
02:00:57,799 --> 02:00:59,884
l had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1791
02:01:00,052 --> 02:01:02,136
l told my brother to watch the stove.

1792
02:01:02,304 --> 02:01:05,431
All day long the guy's been watching
helicopters and tomato sauce.

1793
02:01:06,892 --> 02:01:11,520
l had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1794
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:25,534
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

1795
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:27,995
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?

1796
02:01:28,163 --> 02:01:30,664
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1797
02:01:30,999 --> 02:01:32,833
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.

1798
02:01:33,001 --> 02:01:34,001
You believe me?

1799
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:38,214
Do you believe me?

1800
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:42,051
- That the last one?
- Yeah.

1801
02:01:51,895 --> 02:01:53,854
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you !

1802
02:02:00,946 --> 02:02:04,740
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table. . .

1803
02:02:04,908 --> 02:02:07,201
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1804
02:02:07,369 --> 02:02:09,703
- I have to.
- You don't have to.

1805
02:02:14,668 --> 02:02:16,127
I got to go home.

1806
02:02:18,171 --> 02:02:20,089
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1807
02:02:20,257 --> 02:02:21,549
I've been carrying this all day.

1808
02:02:21,716 --> 02:02:24,343
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1809
02:02:24,511 --> 02:02:26,428
I got to go home and get my hat.

1810
02:02:27,347 --> 02:02:29,557
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

1811
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:32,893
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1812
02:02:33,061 --> 02:02:36,939
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1813
02:02:37,232 --> 02:02:41,235
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

1814
02:02:41,695 --> 02:02:44,738
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1815
02:02:49,661 --> 02:02:53,455
What couId I do if she insisted
l drive her home for her goddamn hat?

1816
02:02:53,623 --> 02:02:56,208
l hid the package in the kitchen
and went to take her home.

1817
02:02:56,376 --> 02:02:57,376
A hat?

1818
02:03:06,511 --> 02:03:07,887
What the fuck is this?

1819
02:03:08,305 --> 02:03:10,848
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker. . .

1820
02:03:11,016 --> 02:03:14,059
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

1821
02:03:18,064 --> 02:03:20,232
For a second, l thought l was dead.

1822
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,735
But when I heard aII the noise,
l knew they were cops.

1823
02:03:22,903 --> 02:03:24,445
Only cops talk that way.

1824
02:03:24,779 --> 02:03:25,946
Don't fucking move.

1825
02:03:26,114 --> 02:03:29,617
lf they had been wiseguys,
l wouldn't have heard a thing.

1826
02:03:30,493 --> 02:03:32,119
I wouId have been dead.

1827
02:03:33,121 --> 02:03:34,580
Michael, lock the door!

1828
02:03:59,105 --> 02:04:01,774
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

1829
02:04:02,192 --> 02:04:03,817
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1830
02:04:03,985 --> 02:04:07,655
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1831
02:04:07,822 --> 02:04:11,909
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1832
02:04:12,077 --> 02:04:14,119
All day l thought the guys
in the helicopter. . .

1833
02:04:14,287 --> 02:04:18,874
were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1834
02:04:19,042 --> 02:04:20,042
Just get the lawyer.

1835
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:23,796
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1836
02:04:23,964 --> 02:04:26,632
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1837
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,718
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1838
02:04:30,553 --> 02:04:34,431
Each one of these counts holds
25- to- life in New York State.

1839
02:04:34,599 --> 02:04:39,186
Twenty- five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1840
02:04:39,938 --> 02:04:42,189
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1841
02:04:43,608 --> 02:04:47,444
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1842
02:04:47,696 --> 02:04:49,863
You got anything good in there?

1843
02:04:51,574 --> 02:04:52,616
Is it good?

1844
02:04:57,706 --> 02:04:59,290
Bye- bye, dickhead.

1845
02:05:02,419 --> 02:05:03,877
See you in Attica, dick.

1846
02:05:04,462 --> 02:05:07,673
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1847
02:05:08,216 --> 02:05:11,468
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1848
02:05:11,636 --> 02:05:13,053
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1849
02:05:13,221 --> 02:05:16,432
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1850
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:18,976
Then you're better off staying in here.

1851
02:05:19,144 --> 02:05:22,730
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

1852
02:05:22,897 --> 02:05:24,523
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1853
02:05:24,691 --> 02:05:28,527
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1854
02:05:29,112 --> 02:05:33,741
Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and l was out.

1855
02:05:33,908 --> 02:05:37,995
l remember l had this feeling
l would be killed right outside the jail.

1856
02:05:38,413 --> 02:05:41,582
l knew Paulie was still pissed at me,
and he's such a hothead.

1857
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:43,500
And l was worried about Jimmy.

1858
02:05:43,668 --> 02:05:47,963
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was into drug deals with me. . .

1859
02:05:48,673 --> 02:05:51,717
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

1860
02:05:53,428 --> 02:05:55,054
This is the bad time.

1861
02:05:55,930 --> 02:05:58,182
l didn't feel safe until l got home.

1862
02:06:00,018 --> 02:06:03,771
Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope. . .

1863
02:06:03,938 --> 02:06:08,525
the cops never found, then disappear
until l can get things straightened out.

1864
02:06:10,195 --> 02:06:11,153
Fuck!

1865
02:06:11,321 --> 02:06:15,074
- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

1866
02:06:16,785 --> 02:06:17,826
You what?

1867
02:06:18,453 --> 02:06:20,954
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

1868
02:06:21,122 --> 02:06:25,209
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1869
02:06:25,377 --> 02:06:28,045
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

1870
02:06:28,213 --> 02:06:32,633
That's all the money we had ! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1871
02:06:33,176 --> 02:06:35,969
I had to. They were going to find it!

1872
02:06:36,137 --> 02:06:40,140
- They would have never found it!
- They would have, I swear to you !

1873
02:06:41,559 --> 02:06:43,227
They would've found it!

1874
02:06:44,646 --> 02:06:46,105
Why did you do that?

1875
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:49,817
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that, Karen?

1876
02:06:51,069 --> 02:06:52,986
Oh, my God !

1877
02:06:53,488 --> 02:06:56,407
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God.

1878
02:07:32,527 --> 02:07:34,486
Paulie, l'm really sorry.

1879
02:07:37,157 --> 02:07:39,908
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1880
02:07:40,076 --> 02:07:41,743
Yeah, you fucked up.

1881
02:07:45,415 --> 02:07:47,332
But I'm all right now.

1882
02:07:48,877 --> 02:07:53,255
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1883
02:07:53,423 --> 02:07:55,632
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1884
02:07:56,926 --> 02:07:59,052
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1885
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:01,180
Like I was never nothing to you.

1886
02:08:01,347 --> 02:08:04,224
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1887
02:08:05,351 --> 02:08:07,728
You know, I was ashamed.

1888
02:08:10,732 --> 02:08:12,733
I'm ashamed now.

1889
02:08:16,070 --> 02:08:18,238
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1890
02:08:21,451 --> 02:08:25,746
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

1891
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:33,045
Take this.

1892
02:08:48,102 --> 02:08:50,229
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1893
02:09:00,615 --> 02:09:02,282
$3,200.

1894
02:09:02,867 --> 02:09:06,870
That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1895
02:09:07,789 --> 02:09:09,998
lt wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1896
02:09:10,208 --> 02:09:12,251
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.

1897
02:09:12,418 --> 02:09:16,797
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1898
02:09:17,215 --> 02:09:19,716
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

1899
02:09:19,884 --> 02:09:22,052
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1900
02:09:22,804 --> 02:09:24,638
You got it? We're dead.

1901
02:09:25,306 --> 02:09:26,306
They're right.

1902
02:09:26,891 --> 02:09:29,851
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

1903
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:35,274
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1904
02:09:35,441 --> 02:09:36,441
He's okay.

1905
02:09:37,652 --> 02:09:38,902
They sobered him up.

1906
02:09:39,404 --> 02:09:41,280
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1907
02:09:45,493 --> 02:09:47,786
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

1908
02:09:47,954 --> 02:09:49,538
Jimmy, I don't know.

1909
02:09:50,623 --> 02:09:54,167
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money. . . .

1910
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:57,337
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1911
02:09:57,505 --> 02:09:59,506
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1912
02:10:00,383 --> 02:10:04,011
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1913
02:10:04,345 --> 02:10:07,973
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1914
02:10:08,141 --> 02:10:11,184
- Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

1915
02:10:11,436 --> 02:10:13,353
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1916
02:10:13,521 --> 02:10:16,857
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1917
02:10:17,108 --> 02:10:18,984
Pick out a few for yourself.

1918
02:10:19,777 --> 02:10:21,445
- For my mom.
- Yeah, whatever.

1919
02:10:21,863 --> 02:10:24,531
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

1920
02:10:24,699 --> 02:10:27,117
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1921
02:10:33,082 --> 02:10:34,583
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1922
02:10:35,043 --> 02:10:36,752
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Don't worry.

1923
02:10:36,961 --> 02:10:39,546
- I'll try.
- Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1924
02:10:42,175 --> 02:10:44,384
- Over here?
- Right down there.

1925
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:01,068
It's over there, on the corner.

1926
02:11:01,736 --> 02:11:03,028
Right there.

1927
02:11:37,230 --> 02:11:39,356
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1928
02:11:39,524 --> 02:11:41,608
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1929
02:11:41,943 --> 02:11:44,778
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1930
02:11:44,946 --> 02:11:46,446
I'll come back later!

1931
02:12:08,886 --> 02:12:10,512
Karen !

1932
02:12:15,017 --> 02:12:16,268
What happened?

1933
02:12:17,478 --> 02:12:18,478
Nothing.

1934
02:12:19,105 --> 02:12:20,981
- What happened?
- I just got scared.

1935
02:12:24,485 --> 02:12:25,652
Got the keys?

1936
02:12:27,405 --> 02:12:31,032
- What happened, Karen?
- I just got scared. It's okay.

1937
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:32,826
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1938
02:12:39,709 --> 02:12:44,296
lf you're part of a crew, nobody ever
tells you they're going to kill you.

1939
02:12:44,839 --> 02:12:46,590
lt doesn't happen that way.

1940
02:12:46,758 --> 02:12:50,177
There aren't any arguments
or curses Iike in the movies.

1941
02:12:50,344 --> 02:12:54,431
Your murderers come with smiIes.
They come as your friends.

1942
02:12:54,599 --> 02:12:56,641
People who cared for you all your life.

1943
02:12:56,809 --> 02:13:01,188
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1944
02:13:01,522 --> 02:13:04,775
So l met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

1945
02:13:05,151 --> 02:13:09,154
l got there 1 5 minutes early,
and Jimmy was already there.

1946
02:13:09,572 --> 02:13:13,992
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1947
02:13:14,327 --> 02:13:16,703
He wanted to make sure I wasn't taiIed.

1948
02:13:17,121 --> 02:13:19,998
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1949
02:13:21,042 --> 02:13:24,044
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

1950
02:13:24,212 --> 02:13:26,546
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

1951
02:13:26,714 --> 02:13:31,676
But l had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if l'd rat on him to save my neck.

1952
02:13:33,346 --> 02:13:37,057
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1953
02:13:37,266 --> 02:13:39,059
Now you understand?

1954
02:13:41,729 --> 02:13:45,065
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

1955
02:13:48,236 --> 02:13:52,489
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1956
02:13:54,909 --> 02:13:59,120
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1957
02:14:01,916 --> 02:14:03,834
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1958
02:14:05,753 --> 02:14:07,087
Know what I'm saying?

1959
02:14:12,093 --> 02:14:15,262
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1960
02:14:18,349 --> 02:14:19,599
No, not at all.

1961
02:14:21,227 --> 02:14:22,811
That way they got nothing.

1962
02:14:31,654 --> 02:14:34,406
Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

1963
02:14:34,866 --> 02:14:38,535
But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

1964
02:14:46,085 --> 02:14:49,421
That's when I knew I wouId never
have come back from FIorida aIive.

1965
02:15:03,811 --> 02:15:07,105
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again. . .

1966
02:15:07,273 --> 02:15:09,107
I don't want to go any place cold.

1967
02:15:10,109 --> 02:15:12,277
You don't have a choice in that matter.

1968
02:15:12,653 --> 02:15:15,196
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it. . .

1969
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:18,658
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to- -

1970
02:15:18,826 --> 02:15:20,535
He's bronchial, that's why.

1971
02:15:20,703 --> 02:15:23,288
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

1972
02:15:23,456 --> 02:15:25,665
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1973
02:15:25,833 --> 02:15:29,544
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1974
02:15:30,671 --> 02:15:31,671
What about them?

1975
02:15:31,839 --> 02:15:34,299
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1976
02:15:35,551 --> 02:15:37,969
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1977
02:15:38,638 --> 02:15:39,679
No.

1978
02:15:40,806 --> 02:15:44,142
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that. . .

1979
02:15:44,518 --> 02:15:48,521
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

1980
02:15:48,689 --> 02:15:51,691
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick. . .

1981
02:15:52,193 --> 02:15:54,361
if there's extraordinary circumstances- -

1982
02:15:54,528 --> 02:15:57,364
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1983
02:15:58,491 --> 02:16:00,241
I can't leave my parents.

1984
02:16:01,494 --> 02:16:03,703
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

1985
02:16:04,956 --> 02:16:07,958
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

1986
02:16:10,294 --> 02:16:11,962
I can't do it without you.

1987
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:16,466
So, you do whatever, but. . .that's it.

1988
02:16:18,010 --> 02:16:20,553
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

1989
02:16:20,888 --> 02:16:23,348
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

1990
02:16:23,683 --> 02:16:26,977
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

1991
02:16:27,144 --> 02:16:28,812
They want Henry, not me.

1992
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:32,065
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1993
02:16:32,984 --> 02:16:36,403
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

1994
02:16:36,570 --> 02:16:38,989
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger- -

1995
02:16:39,156 --> 02:16:41,574
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me. . .

1996
02:16:41,742 --> 02:16:43,118
the babe- in- the- woods routine.

1997
02:16:43,285 --> 02:16:47,872
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

1998
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:51,251
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

1999
02:16:56,507 --> 02:16:58,550
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail. . .

2000
02:16:58,718 --> 02:17:02,012
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2001
02:17:02,763 --> 02:17:04,472
He knows it and you know it.

2002
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:07,809
What about the kids and school?

2003
02:17:07,977 --> 02:17:10,270
Will they get left back?
l mean, what goes on?

2004
02:17:10,604 --> 02:17:13,023
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2005
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:15,650
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2006
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:18,903
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2007
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:23,158
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2008
02:17:27,413 --> 02:17:30,040
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2009
02:17:30,207 --> 02:17:32,042
lt was easy for us to disappear.

2010
02:17:32,585 --> 02:17:34,711
My house
was in my mother- in- law's name.

2011
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:36,838
My cars were registered to my wife.

2012
02:17:37,006 --> 02:17:40,467
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2013
02:17:40,634 --> 02:17:42,969
l never voted or paid taxes.

2014
02:17:43,554 --> 02:17:48,016
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know l was alive.

2015
02:17:48,184 --> 02:17:50,727
- Do you see him here in this courtroom?
- Yes.

2016
02:17:51,145 --> 02:17:53,480
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2017
02:17:56,150 --> 02:18:00,779
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2018
02:18:01,906 --> 02:18:04,991
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2019
02:18:05,326 --> 02:18:07,327
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

2020
02:18:07,912 --> 02:18:09,829
Can you point him out for the jury?

2021
02:18:11,791 --> 02:18:15,919
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2022
02:18:17,213 --> 02:18:18,922
Your Honor, I have a document. . . .

2023
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:21,508
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2024
02:18:22,259 --> 02:18:23,802
I stiII Iove the Iife.

2025
02:18:24,178 --> 02:18:26,096
We were treated Iike movie stars
with muscIe.

2026
02:18:26,263 --> 02:18:28,515
We had it all, just for the asking.

2027
02:18:28,682 --> 02:18:32,018
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2028
02:18:32,353 --> 02:18:35,522
l had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2029
02:18:35,689 --> 02:18:37,941
l had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.

2030
02:18:38,109 --> 02:18:41,903
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2031
02:18:42,071 --> 02:18:44,114
- Objection !
- Objection sustained.

2032
02:18:44,281 --> 02:18:47,367
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it.

2033
02:18:48,369 --> 02:18:50,078
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence. . . .

2034
02:18:50,246 --> 02:18:52,205
Anything l wanted was a phone call away.

2035
02:18:52,373 --> 02:18:55,792
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.

2036
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:58,461
l'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...

2037
02:18:58,629 --> 02:19:02,799
then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2038
02:19:02,967 --> 02:19:04,175
It didn't matter.

2039
02:19:04,718 --> 02:19:09,597
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2040
02:19:10,015 --> 02:19:11,391
We ran everything.

2041
02:19:11,934 --> 02:19:16,229
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2042
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:19,899
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2043
02:19:22,027 --> 02:19:23,528
And now it's all over.

2044
02:19:24,446 --> 02:19:25,905
That's the hardest part.

2045
02:19:26,907 --> 02:19:28,533
Today everything is different.

2046
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:32,871
There's no action.
l have to wait around like everyone else.

2047
02:19:33,247 --> 02:19:35,039
Can't even get decent food.

2048
02:19:35,791 --> 02:19:38,918
After l got here l ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce. . .

2049
02:19:39,086 --> 02:19:40,920
and l got egg noodles and ketchup.

2050
02:19:41,755 --> 02:19:43,256
l'm an average nobody.

2051
02:19:44,633 --> 02:19:47,427
l get to live the rest of my life
Iike a schnook.
