00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:06,575
sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle.

352
00:34:09,657 --> 00:34:13,423
I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine...

353
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:17,922
that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief...

354
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:20,763
of a loss so overwhelming.

355
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,603
But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you

356
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:27,106
the consolation
that may be found...

357
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:30,109
in the thanks
of the republic...

358
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,611
they died to save.

359
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:38,117
I pray that
Our Heavenly Father

360
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:40,950
may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

361
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:42,955
and leave you only
the cherished memory

362
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:45,355
of the loved and lost...

363
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,620
and the solemn pride
that must be yours

364
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:50,630
to have laid so costly
a sacrifice

365
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:52,632
upon the altar of freedom.

366
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,134
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully...

367
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:57,637
''Abraham Lincoln."

368
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:18,821
That boy is alive.

369
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:22,485
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

370
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:26,666
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

371
00:35:27,735 --> 00:35:29,726
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:43,515
We expected 32 tanks
on the beach.

373
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:44,676
27 didn't make it.

374
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:46,014
Miller, Charlie Company.

375
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:47,178
Go on in, Captain.

376
00:35:47,254 --> 00:35:48,687
I understand
your situation,

377
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:51,190
but if we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,

378
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:53,021
we're gonna have
an entire division

379
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:56,029
stuck at Carentan with
its pants around its ankles.

380
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,031
Well, you let me know.

381
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,032
Have Charlie Company
hold at Vierville

382
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,193
until we can get
some armor up there.

383
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:04,032
Yes, sir.
Runner!

384
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:07,005
<b><font color="#DF01D7">(TRUCK IGNITION GRINDING)</font></b>

385
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:11,538
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door

386
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:13,046
for the rest of us.

387
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:14,206
Instead they misdropped,

388
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:15,715
scattered all their
sticks into the wind.

389
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:16,876
What's your situation?

390
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:19,544
Uh, yes, sir.
Sector 4 is secure.

391
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,554
We, uh...

392
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:23,954
we took out towed 88s

393
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:26,049
here, here...

394
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:27,218
and here.

395
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:29,057
They'd already gotten
4 of our Shermans

396
00:36:29,129 --> 00:36:30,562
and a number of our
deuce-and-a-halves.

397
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:33,066
These 2 minefields
are actually one big one.

398
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:35,068
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

399
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:37,569
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field--

400
00:36:37,638 --> 00:36:39,071
little bit of everything.

401
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,731
Sprengmine 44s,
Schumine 42s,

402
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:43,072
pot mines, A-200s--
the little wooden bastards

403
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:46,078
that the mine detectors
don't pick up.

404
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:48,080
This road here...

405
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,082
they placed big mushrooms--
Teller mine 43s,

406
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,743
I guess for our tanks--

407
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,254
from here right up
to the edge of the village,

408
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:55,584
right here.

409
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:57,590
So we marked 'em,
called the engineers.

410
00:36:57,658 --> 00:36:58,920
Resistance?

411
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:01,085
We had higher support
expectations, sir.

412
00:37:01,161 --> 00:37:03,595
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

413
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:07,100
Wehrmacht 346 Infantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

414
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,930
We ended up
with 23 prisoners.

415
00:37:09,002 --> 00:37:11,267
We turned them over
to M.P.s from the 29th.

416
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:16,942
What about our casualties?

417
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,308
Well...

418
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:21,108
the figures...

419
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:23,615
were 35 dead...

420
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:24,946
times 2 wounded.

421
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:26,451
They just...

422
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,785
didn't wanna give up
those 88s.

423
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:33,126
It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

424
00:37:33,194 --> 00:37:34,627
Yes, sir.

425
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:37,125
John...

426
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,959
I've got another one
for you.

427
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:43,127
Yes, sir.

428
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:45,398
This one's straight
from the top.

429
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:51,511

a squad over to Neuville

431
00:37:53,748 --> 00:37:56,011
on a public relations mission.

432
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,017
<b><font color="#404040">HORVATH:</font></b>
You leading a squad?

433
00:37:58,085 --> 00:38:01,179
Some private in the 101st
lost 3 brothers,

434
00:38:01,255 --> 00:38:02,847
and he's got a ticket home.

435
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:04,356
How come Neuville?

436
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:06,016
They think he's up there
somewhere,

437
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:08,028
part of all
those airborne misdrops.

438
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:09,529
It's not gonna be easy

439
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,030
finding one
particular soldier

440
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,532
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

441
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,533
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

442
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:16,193
But what about
the company?

443
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,033
We take the pick
of the litter,

444
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:20,039
and the rest get folded
into Baker.

445
00:38:20,107 --> 00:38:21,540
Jesus Christ.

446
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,872
They took away
your company?

447
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:26,209
It wasn't my company,
it was the army's.

448
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,215
So they told me, anyway.

449
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:29,716
Give me REIBEN on B.A.R.,

450
00:38:29,784 --> 00:38:32,048
JACKSON, WADE, Beasley
and Caparzo.

451
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,711
Beasley's dead.

452
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:35,379
All right.
MELLISH then.

453
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:36,888
We got anybody speaks French?

454
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:38,549
Not that I know of.

455
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:40,888
What about Talbot?

456
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:41,893
This morning.

457
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:42,894
Oh.

458
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:44,055
All right.

459
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:46,066
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

460
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:48,568
Assemble at Battalion
Motor Pool on the beach.

461
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:49,568
Yes, sir.

462
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:51,070
What are we gonna do?

463
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:52,070
Listen up-- What?

464
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:53,231
What we gonna do?

465
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:54,740
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

466
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:56,400
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo.

467
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:58,410
I thought you liked it
in the ass.

468
00:38:58,478 --> 00:38:59,604
What?

469
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,648
Attention!

470
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,149
As you were.

471
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:04,980
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham...

I'm Upham, sir.

00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:08,816
I understand you speak
French and German.

475
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,822
Yes, sir.

476
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:10,982
How's your accent?

477
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,491
Just a slight one
in French,

478
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,992
but my German's clean.
A touch of Bavarian, sir.

479
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,494
Very good. You've
been reassigned to me.

480
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,654
Grab your gear.

481
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,924
We're going to a place
called Neuville.

482
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:18,930
Yes, sir.

483
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:20,057
When was this updated?

484
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:21,498
Updated as of 0830
this morning.

485
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,593
Uh, sir...

486
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,160
this is
the 12th S.S. Panzer.

487
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,001
These are the 2 axis
that advance south.

488
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,507
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

489
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,008
That's what I understand,
Corporal.

490
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,509
Um, sir,

491
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,511
there are a lot of Germans
in Neuville.

492
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,012
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

493
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,173
No, sir.

494
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,011
Just if you consider
I've never been in combat.

495
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,517
I make maps,
and I translate.

496
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,519
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

497
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,520
Yes, sir.

498
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,022
My 2 guys were killed.

499
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,524
It's just that
I haven't held a weapon

500
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,025
since basic training, sir.

501
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,028
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

502
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,187
Yes, sir.

503
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,025
Well, then get your gear.

504
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,030
Yes, sir.

505
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,431
Sir, may I br--

506
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,041
May I bring
my typewriter, sir?

507
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:08,044
Yes, sir.

508
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,052
Thank you very much, sir.

509
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,553
That a souvenir?

510
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,883
Uh, no, sir.

511
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,719
Take your time, Corporal.

512
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,392
You should look

513
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,056
on the bright side
of things, Corporal.

514
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,065
Yes, sir.

515
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:27,396
For one thing...

516
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,901
you don't need
to carry those.

517
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,403
You'll need that.

518
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,063

529

530
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:53,278

531
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:54,446
And another thing,

532
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:55,955
every time you salute
the captain,

533
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:57,957
you make him a target
for the Germans.

534
00:41:58,025 --> 00:41:59,458
Do us a favor.
Don't do it.

535

I'm standing next to him,

536

00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,461
Uh, capisci.

538

540
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:07,492
Sorry.

541
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,467
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

542
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:12,472
that develop between
soldiers during war.

543
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,472

the captain where he's from?

Yeah, ask the captain.

all right?

559
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:43,468
I mean, you got a mother,
Sarge has got a mother.

560
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:45,971
I mean, shit, I bet even
the captain's got a mother.

561
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:48,473
Well, maybe
not the captain,

562
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:49,874
but the rest of us
got mothers.

563
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:51,468

Well, from my way
of thinking, sir,

585
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:33,015
this entire mission is
a serious misallocation

586
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:35,021
of valuable
military resources.

587
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:37,023
Yeah. Go on.

that God gave me
a special gift,

590
00:43:40,594 --> 00:43:42,357
made me a fine
instrument of warfare.

591
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,692
REIBEN, pay attention.

592
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:46,356
Now, this is the way
to gripe.

593
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:47,526
Continue, JACKSON.

594
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:49,035
Well, what I mean
by that, sir,

595
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:51,537
is if you was to put me
and this sniper rifle

596
00:43:51,606 --> 00:43:53,540
anywhere up to
and including 1 mile

597
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:55,041

Hey, so, Captain,
what about you?

603
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,042
I mean,
you don't gripe at all?

604
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:07,883
I don't gripe to you,
REIBEN. I'm a captain.

605
00:44:07,955 --> 00:44:09,217
There's a chain of command.

606
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,053
Gripes go up, not down.
Always up.

and so on.

610
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:17,058
I don't gripe to you.

611
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:18,563

You should know that
as a ranger.

613
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:22,067
I'm sorry, sir,
but, uh...

614
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:23,568
let's say
you weren't a captain,

615
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:25,071
or maybe I was a major.

616
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:26,572

Well, in that case,

618
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:30,906

an excellent mission, sir,

objective, sir,

Hey, Captain.

01:13:53,306 --> 01:13:54,967
Soldier,
you want to fill me in?

1220
01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:57,010
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant Dewindt, sir.

1221
01:13:57,077 --> 01:13:58,339
99th Troop Carrier Squadron

1222
01:13:58,412 --> 01:14:00,937

327th Glider Infantry.

1223
01:14:01,014 --> 01:14:02,447
This one was mine, sir.

1224
01:14:02,516 --> 01:14:03,847
I was the pilot.

1225
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:04,906
22 men dead.

1226
01:14:04,985 --> 01:14:06,919
I ended up over there
without a scratch.

1227
01:14:06,987 --> 01:14:08,284
It took my copilot's head
right off.

1228
01:14:08,355 --> 01:14:10,220
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

1229
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,155
Well, the guys
we came in with, sir,

1230
01:14:12,225 --> 01:14:14,625
they headed off first night.
Haven't seen them since.

1231
01:14:14,694 --> 01:14:16,889
Meantime, other guys
keep showing up,

1233
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,768
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

1234

head off to make trouble, sir.

1235
01:14:24,337 --> 01:14:26,237
We're looking for
a Private James Ryan.

1236
01:14:26,306 --> 01:14:28,604
He was in Baker Company
5-0-6 of the 101st.

1237
01:14:28,675 --> 01:14:29,903
No, you got me, sir.

1238
01:14:29,976 --> 01:14:31,341
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

1239
01:14:31,411 --> 01:14:32,537
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1240
01:14:32,612 --> 01:14:35,547

See if Ryan's in it.

deputy commander, 101st.

1260
01:15:21,027 --> 01:15:23,552
Some fucking genius
had the great idea

1261
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:25,063
of welding a couple
of steel plates

1262
01:15:25,132 --> 01:15:27,100
onto our deck to keep
the general safe

1263
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:28,566
from ground fire.

1264
01:15:28,635 --> 01:15:30,330
Unfortunately, they forgot
to tell me about it

1265
01:15:30,403 --> 01:15:32,564

getting airborne.

1266
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:34,665
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train.

1267
01:15:34,742 --> 01:15:36,003
OK?

1268
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:37,338
Gross overload.

1269
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:40,174

And when--
And when we released,

1272
01:15:45,585 --> 01:15:47,746
you know, I cut
as hard as I could,

1273
01:15:47,821 --> 01:15:49,345
tried to gain
some altitude

1274
01:15:49,422 --> 01:15:51,356
and still keep her
from stalling.

1275
01:15:51,424 --> 01:15:53,416
We came down
like a fucking meteor.

1276

we ended up.

1277
01:15:56,396 --> 01:15:58,455

1278
01:15:58,532 --> 01:16:01,160
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

1279
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:03,964
We were just--
We were just too damn heavy,

1281
01:16:05,272 --> 01:16:07,536
The grass was wet.

1282
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:10,041
Downward slope and all.

1283
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:12,875
22 guys dead.

1284
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:16,881
All that for a general?

1285
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:19,111
One man.

1286
01:16:20,854 --> 01:16:22,481

Y'all got that right.

1292
01:16:30,664 --> 01:16:33,326
I looked up "FUBAR" in
the German dictionary.

1293
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,992
There's no "FUBAR"
in there.

- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1295
01:16:36,169 --> 01:16:37,659
There's more paratroops
out there.

1296

Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

We can't push on Paris until
we take a deep water port,

So he's gonna try
to get his armor

across the Merderet River
anywhere he can.

1438

our invasion forces in the flank

right turn to Cherbourg.

Sir, we have

1715

I have a sixth sense

Then why don't you
just do it, Sarge?

1721
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:35,642
Do it, man.
Put one in my leg--

I'm gonna shoot you

1727
01:39:47,026 --> 01:39:48,357

You are a coward

01:39:50,364 --> 01:39:51,854
I'm waiting,

01:39:51,932 --> 01:39:54,729
Mike, what's the pool

1731
01:39:54,801 --> 01:39:57,133
What-- What's it up to?

What is it, $300?
Is that it, 300?

1733
01:40:00,473 --> 01:40:02,498
I'm a schoolteacher.

1734
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,813
I teach English composition

1735
01:40:09,883 --> 01:40:12,180
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1736
01:40:12,251 --> 01:40:15,015
The last 11 years,

1737
01:40:15,088 --> 01:40:17,454
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1738
01:40:19,993 --> 01:40:21,927
I was the coach
of the baseball team

1739
01:40:21,995 --> 01:40:23,860
in the springtime.

1740
01:40:25,665 --> 01:40:28,100
I'll be doggone.

1741
01:40:28,168 --> 01:40:31,762
Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1742
01:40:31,838 --> 01:40:35,638
they'd think,
"Well, that figures."

1743
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:39,906
But over here,
it's a...

1744
01:40:39,979 --> 01:40:43,380
a big...

1745
01:40:43,449 --> 01:40:44,939
a big mystery.

1746
01:40:45,018 --> 01:40:50,217
So I guess
I've changed some.

1747
01:40:50,289 --> 01:40:54,726
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much,

1748
01:40:54,794 --> 01:40:56,421
my wife is even going
to recognize me

1749
01:40:56,496 --> 01:40:58,691
whenever it is
I get back to her.

1750
01:41:00,366 --> 01:41:05,532
And how I'll ever
be able to...

1751
01:41:05,606 --> 01:41:08,131
to tell her about
days like today.

1752
01:41:11,077 --> 01:41:14,444
Ah, Ryan...

1753
01:41:14,514 --> 01:41:16,038
I don't know anything
about Ryan.

1754
01:41:16,115 --> 01:41:18,015
I don't care.

1755
01:41:18,084 --> 01:41:20,678
The man means nothing to me.
He's just a name.

1756
01:41:20,753 --> 01:41:23,723

well then...
then that's my mission.

1761

All right,
I won't stop you.

01:41:48,748 --> 01:41:50,943
I'll even put in
the paperwork.

1766
01:41:53,286 --> 01:41:54,913
I just know that
every man I kill,

1767
01:41:54,987 --> 01:41:56,978

1869
01:50:11,951 --> 01:50:13,385
Why not any of
these guys?

1870
01:50:13,453 --> 01:50:14,784
They all fought
just as hard as me!

1871
01:50:19,459 --> 01:50:22,917
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1872
01:50:22,996 --> 01:50:26,158
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1873
01:50:33,139 --> 01:50:35,664
Tell her
that when you found me,

1874
01:50:35,742 --> 01:50:39,473
I was here with the only
brothers I have left.

1875
01:50:39,546 --> 01:50:43,846
And that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1876
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:46,476
I think
she'll understand that.

1877
01:50:46,552 --> 01:50:48,816

01:51:35,902 --> 01:51:39,963
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1881
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:43,099
The world has taken
a turn for the surreal.

1882
01:51:43,175 --> 01:51:46,042
Clearly, but the question
still stands.

1883
01:51:46,111 --> 01:51:48,546
I don't know.

1884
01:51:48,615 --> 01:51:50,139

No, Mike, I do.

01:51:57,891 --> 01:52:00,758
Well...

1888
01:52:00,826 --> 01:52:02,760
part of me thinks
the kid's right.

1889
01:52:02,828 --> 01:52:04,762
What's he done
to deserve this?

1890
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,765
If he wants
to stay here, fine.

1891
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:09,097

1892
01:52:09,169 --> 01:52:11,899
Yeah.

1893
01:52:11,971 --> 01:52:13,905
But another
part of me thinks...

1894
01:52:13,973 --> 01:52:17,374
what if by
some miracle we stay

1895
01:52:17,444 --> 01:52:20,207
and actually make it
out of here?

1896
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:22,770
Some day we might look
back on this and decide

1897
01:52:22,848 --> 01:52:27,377
that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1898
01:52:27,454 --> 01:52:28,921

shitty mess.

That's what
I was thinking, sir.

1901
01:52:38,531 --> 01:52:41,021

1902
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:44,036
if we do that...

1903
01:52:44,104 --> 01:52:47,562
we all earn
the right to go home.

1904
01:52:50,343 --> 01:52:51,867

11 Hawkins mines.

1909

You got the 2 bazookas, but
they only got 8 rounds left,

1910

and assorted small arms.

1911
01:53:10,397 --> 01:53:12,126
We had a 60 mortar,

1912
01:53:12,198 --> 01:53:13,825
but an arty round
took it out.

1913
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:16,801
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1914

what we got here are

Some TNT or
some composition "B"?

All right, you can

1968
01:55:04,377 --> 01:55:08,370
You take
a standard-issue G.I. sock,

01:55:08,448 --> 01:55:11,440
cram it with as much
comp "B" as it can hold,

rig up a simple fuse,

then you coat the whole
thing with axle grease.

1972

That way,
when you throw it,

1973
01:55:18,892 --> 01:55:20,359
it should stick.

a surprise for me.

2142

up into the loft, and...

2143
02:04:02,648 --> 02:04:05,083
there was
my oldest brother Dan...

and she screams
and she jumps up

2160
02:04:40,119 --> 02:04:41,644
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

2161
02:04:41,721 --> 02:04:43,052
but she's still got
this shirt over her head.

2162
02:04:43,123 --> 02:04:44,920
She goes running
right into the wall

2163

2164
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:49,958

Alice is over there
unconscious.

2168
02:04:54,266 --> 02:04:55,790
He's got to wake her up.

2169
02:04:55,868 --> 02:04:57,961
So he grabs her
by a leg,

2170
02:04:58,037 --> 02:04:59,163
and he's dragging her.

2171
02:04:59,238 --> 02:05:00,900
At the same time,
he picks up a shovel,

2172
02:05:00,974 --> 02:05:02,737
and he's going
after Sean.

2173
02:05:02,809 --> 02:05:04,970
And Sean said, "What are you
trying to hit me for?

2174
02:05:05,045 --> 02:05:07,774
I just did you a favor."

2175
02:05:07,847 --> 02:05:10,577
And so this makes Dan
more angry.

2176
02:05:10,649 --> 02:05:12,549
He tries to swing
this thing.

2177
02:05:12,618 --> 02:05:14,245
He loses the shovel.

2178
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,481
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

2179
02:05:16,555 --> 02:05:17,817
The thing explodes.

2180
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:18,982

at this very moment,

2453
02:36:44,442 --> 02:36:48,003

and steadfast dedication

2461

2466
02:37:24,249 --> 02:37:25,648

with you some words

"I pray
that our Heavenly Father

2487
