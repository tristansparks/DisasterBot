1
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

2
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:02,013
It's so hot in here...

3
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:04,917
and I can't figure this stupid thing out.

4
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,652
I signed the papers.

5
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,617
Wow.

6
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,053
How are you feeling?

7
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,329
Terrible.

8
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,534
Francis was there.
Obviously, he was there.

9
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,639
It was really hard to see him.

10
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,176
And he signed so fast.

11
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:32,902
I at least pretended to look
things over one last time.

12
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:35,139
He sounds terrified to me.

13
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,544
It's going to take a while.

14
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:40,577
I mean, nine years, Rafi.

15
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:43,784
You can't just walk away from that kind of time.

16
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:48,189
The crazy thing is...

17
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:52,664
I'm out of this marriage, what, five minutes...

18
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,500
and all of a sudden I just...

19
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:01,340
I find myself thinking about...

20
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,273
a baby.

21
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:08,180
Why now? And why didn't I think
about this when I was married?

22
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:10,009
Well, I mean, you know...

23
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:13,816
on a certain level, you knew
this was not the right man.

24
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,783
So you were protecting yourself in that way.

25
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,451
That was a good thing.

26
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,330
Oh, Rafi, you're coming alive again.

27
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,826
You know, you just want all the things...

28
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,767
that you had to forget that you could have.

29
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:31,067
That's a very good place to move into.

30
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:34,369
And the baby thing will happen...

31
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,639
when it's the right time.

32
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,478
But just focus on the now.

33
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,211
For now.

34
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,789
Hey, Dave, it's Morris...

35
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:55,054
Listen, I got a favor to ask you.

36
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,189
I went out with this girl the other night.

37
00:04:57,266 --> 00:05:00,793
And she told me never to call
her again. You know how that goes.

38
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:03,303
So I'm gonna need you to come with me this time.

39
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,169
Don't freak out, all right?

40
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,403
I don't know how to get
to Bay Ridge. I'm not sure.

41
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:09,735
Bye.

42
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:14,438
I don't understand why I
have to be a part of this.

43
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:16,313
You have an incurable sickness.

44
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,114
It's okay, though. I understand.

45
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:20,017
But why am I being involved?

46
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,283
How are you being involved?
Because I'm in the car.

47
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:25,190
I'm going to be a witness to
this. That makes me an accessory.

48
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,490
What, like a handbag? Morris.

49
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:29,325
So who's it this time?

50
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:31,798
You know what? Don't... I
don't wanna know. Don't tell me.

51
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,859
Her father's probably in
waste management or something.

52
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:37,906
What I would like to know is why
no girl will go out with you twice.

53
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,533
One date, it's over. What
do you do? What do you say?

54
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:42,770
You know, it's a mystery to me, too.

55
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:50,076
Are you a hermaphrodite?
Do you have hantavirus?

56
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,043
This is it. Come on.

57
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:54,415
All right, just make this quick.

58
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,252
I gotta meet Michelle at
the movies a little later.

59
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,816
Michelle? God. Just make it quick.

60
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,742
Hi. What the hell are you doing here?

61
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,445
I told you I never wanted to see you again.

62
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,612
I just want to talk. Just
come out here and let's talk.

63
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,349
I can't believe you came to my house.

64
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:30,448
You have no respect for
women. I don't, I'm sorry.

65
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,789
You hurt my feelings, you piece of shit.

66
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,227
Okay. Okay. I can't believe you're here.

67
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,988
Okay? Okay?

68
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:38,760
Mikey! Okay, I'm gonna go.

69
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,734
Joey, come out here!

70
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:43,498
Mikey! Joey! Come out here! Mikey? Joey?

71
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,766
Go! Get in the car! Get in the car!

72
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,674
Go, go, go!

73
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,145
Oh, shit!

74
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:01,720
It's not funny.

75
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,828
Meeting Michelle. Yeah.

76
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:18,436
What are you going to see, Beaches?

77
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:19,838
You're the wind beneath my wings, Mo.

78
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:22,274
Hey, did you ever know you were my hero?

79
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,439
Have fun. All right, man.

80
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,442
Dave.

81
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:33,877
Randall.

82
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,115
No, no, I remember your name.

83
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,350
How you doing? Hi.

84
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,325
What's going on? Nothing much.

85
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:44,287
This is my friend Katherine
and this is my friend Rafi.

86
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:47,430
Hi. Hi.

87
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,270
So what are you doing here?

88
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,932
Well, I thought I'd see a movie. Right.

89
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:55,169
Why? Are you embarrassed
to be seen with me?

90
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:56,904
What? It's okay. Just tell me.

91
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,208
My God, this kid is funny.
Where did you get him?

92
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:04,048
Well, he works at Travelart
and we had that client...

93
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,177
Hey.

94
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:06,345
Hey.

95
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,087
Randall. I'm sorry.

96
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,488
Hi. Michelle. Michelle.

97
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,584
You have your tickets yet?
No, we're gonna get tickets.

98
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:13,753
Are you seeing this? Yeah.

99
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:14,853
You are? Yeah.

100
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,056
That's great. We're...

101
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,259
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay, good. We'll be in...

102
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:21,931
Get in the bun.

103
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:24,499
Get in the bun.

104
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,255
It's locked.

105
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,748
What?

106
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,285
The door. It won't open.

107
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,423
So, does this happen to you a lot?

108
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,234
Actually, not often enough.

109
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,603
So what are we gonna do?

110
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:05,043
Wait till somebody comes out.

111
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:08,442
Right.

112
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:32,636
Thank you. Yeah.

113
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,139
So, how long have you guys been dating?

114
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:39,112
Couple of weeks. We're not dating.

115
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,547
Okay. Next question.

116
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:43,982
I mean, we only went out twice before this.

117
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:46,577
Do you consider that
dating? I guess I did.

118
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:47,849
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,423
I mean, to me, dating sounds more serious.

120
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:54,223
Like you've already been going
out for a couple of months, like...

121
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:55,661
Maybe you don't live together...

122
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,857
but you definitely stay over
a couple of nights a week.

123
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,924
You don't worry about who
paid for the last meal anymore.

124
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,401
You've seen each other pee, you know?

125
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,994
More serious kind of stuff.

126
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:05,869
Then what do you call this?

127
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:08,433
Well, that's it.

128
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,035
There are officially no cute boys left here.

129
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,875
All right. It's so nice to get out.

130
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:15,644
It was nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

131
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,817
Dave. Very nice to see you. Good night.

132
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,481
Bye. Nice to meet you.

133
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:39,663
One, two, three, four.

134
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,775
Just fucking call her.

135
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,990
Hello.

136
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,226
Hello?

137
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,648
Hello? Hi. It's Dave...

138
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:30,449
Bloomberg.

139
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,550
Did you just call me?

140
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:34,820
Yes.

141
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,120
We get disconnected?

142
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,357
No.

143
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,100
Did you hang up?

144
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,601
Uh-huh.

145
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,337
They say it's better to lie sometimes...

146
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,035
but I can't really do
that when I'm this nervous.

147
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,407
I think I need to be in a better place.

148
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,409
I like it better this way. I've
been around enough lying to say so.

149
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:55,881
You had a lot of liars in your life, huh?

150
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,281
What? Shit.

151
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:04,156
Would you like to go out
to dinner with me tomorrow?

152
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:08,056
David, I'm making
a sandwich. Do you want one?

153
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,720
No, I'm fine!

154
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,431
Who's that? That's my roommates.

155
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,434
So, do you want to have dinner?

156
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:18,866
Yes. Yeah?

157
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,667
I'll call you tomorrow.

158
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,602
Okay.

159
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:26,305
Okay.

160
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:29,547
Bye. Bye.

161
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,081
Okay, Grandma.

162
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:42,257
So, what kind of sandwich are we talking about?

163
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:58,778
Hi, I'm here to see Rafi
Gardet. My name's Dave.

164
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,421
Raphael. It's Damien.

165
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:11,086
Yeah. There's a...

166
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,452
It's Dave.

167
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,358
Dave here to see you.

168
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,125
Okay.

169
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,125
She'll be right down.

170
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:36,107
Bubbles here, I like that.

171
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,318
It's a good touch.

172
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:45,982
Is that wool? Looks itchy. Is it itchy?

173
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:16,189
I think it's the biggest
contradiction in the world.

174
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,316
Jews eat carp, okay?

175
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,725
Who eats carp? They don't
serve it in restaurants.

176
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,888
Have you ever seen carp on a menu in your life?

177
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,864
Please, answer me honestly.

178
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,727
No. No. You know why?

179
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,697
Because it's disgusting.

180
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,303
But for all this terrible food...

181
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,806
you've never seen a people so
obsessed with it in your life.

182
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,105
It's a remnant. I'll bet
every immigrant group...

183
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:39,271
that was displaced by World War
II puts a lot of emphasis on food.

184
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,712
I mean, it was scarce.

185
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:44,081
Carp is cheap, right? It was
probably a staple of their diet.

186
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:47,087
What is this, the History Channel?
You trying to kill this for me?

187
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:49,749
Come on. Sorry. Fine, go ahead.

188
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,289
Okay, so my friend Morris...

189
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,705
So I think you're gonna love
this place. It's beautiful.

190
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:11,142
No one's ever there.

191
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:13,510
Can I see some ID? Sure.

192
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,747
Love when that happens. Yeah.

193
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,648
I wish I still got carded.

194
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,821
Excuse me, Dave. Yes.

195
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:26,224
Quick question for you. How old are you?

196
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,657
Actually, I don't speak
Vietnamese. Why do you ask?

197
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:32,359
Are you being evasive? I am trying.

198
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,098
You know, I don't tell my age.

199
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,569
I think people get way too
caught up with the number.

200
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,368
I'm 37. Did you know that?

201
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:41,173
You know, I hadn't really thought about it.

202
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:42,334
Sure you hadn't.

203
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,105
Look, I know you're a lot younger than me.

204
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,646
I'd just like to know, you know, how much.

205
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:49,049
Okay, let me guess.

206
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,784
Twenty-nine. No.

207
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:55,389
Really? Older?

208
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:58,385
You don't look 30 to me. Thanks.

209
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,959
I'm 23.

210
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,460
No, you're not.

211
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,690
I don't believe you.
Let me see the license.

212
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,268
Oh, my God. You're a child.

213
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,337
Taxi! I have T-shirts older than you.

214
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:21,314
They let me drive, okay?
Yeah, with a parent in the car.

215
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:23,646
How come you seem so much older to me?

216
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,513
I don't know. I don't
know if I can do this.

217
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,318
Come on.

218
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,954
Can you hold this? Sure.

219
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:45,465
Are we gonna get in trouble? I hope so.

220
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,225
This place is amazing.

221
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:09,988
I can't believe I've walked
by this for 15 years...

222
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:11,964
and I didn't know it was here.

223
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:31,980
Let's have it.

224
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:33,980
What?

225
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,221
How did you know?

226
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,555
Okay. His name is David...

227
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:43,995
and he's really, really nice.

228
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,726
I mean, sweet.

229
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,928
And I met him a few days ago
and he asked me out on a date.

230
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:51,904
And we went out to dinner...

231
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,670
and we kissed.

232
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,275
I like beer.

233
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:00,546
Good. I mean, no, I...

234
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:04,376
I never used to. I had to learn,
'cause nobody in my family drinks.

235
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:06,977
You're lucky, 'cause
everyone in my family drinks.

236
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,523
No, I mean, my family,
they don't drink anything.

237
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,217
It's like Salt Lake City.

238
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:15,058
They'll have maybe a sip of wine
every Friday night, on the Sabbath.

239
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:17,893
That's it, though, and it's Manischewitz.

240
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,296
I've never had that.

241
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:20,664
You like High-C?

242
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:23,067
'Cause my mom, she likes to
keep the wine in the fridge...

243
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,605
and we'll still be drinking
it three months later.

244
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,574
A good chardonnay can
last... Yeah. It's red.

245
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,341
That's not good.

246
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:33,308
Hey, by the way. Things to avoid. Okay.

247
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:35,712
Beginning sentences with, "My mom."

248
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:38,278
Right.

249
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,552
I'm all over it.

250
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:50,021
However old you are, I have to say...

251
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:54,334
I haven't had this much
fun in a really long time.

252
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:58,200
I'm glad I met you.

253
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:00,798
I gotta tell you...

254
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,276
you're making me nervous in a
way I'm not really familiar with.

255
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:29,268
My God, Lisa, what am I doing?
I only got divorced last week.

256
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,668
Easy, easy. It's okay.

257
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,004
You didn't tattoo his name
on your toochis, did you?

258
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,736
Do you want to save some of that for later?

259
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,648
What? What is it?

260
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:48,817
He's...

261
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,559
He's only 27. And?

262
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:58,394
What do you mean, "and"? I
mean, that's 10 years different.

263
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,295
He could be my brother.

264
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:03,030
If he were one year younger,
he could be your brother.

265
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,833
Aren't you embarrassed for me? I mean...

266
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:08,603
this just smells of "pool
boy at Sandals Resort."

267
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,310
Oh, it's fine. It might
even do you some good...

268
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:16,907
if you know what I mean.

269
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,952
Lisa! What?

270
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:23,715
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
You're both at your sexual peak.

271
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,592
So you approve? Yes.

272
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:31,461
Unequivocally. Yes, this is good.

273
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:35,867
But it can't really go anywhere.
You know, I mean, he's...

274
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:37,799
He's so young.

275
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,272
Yeah, but it's a little early
to be worrying about that.

276
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:43,970
And besides, you're not looking
to get married next week, right?

277
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,410
Enjoy your life a little bit.

278
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:49,647
You deserve this.

279
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:55,078
Twenty-seven. Hell, I deserve this!

280
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,756
No, she's not Jewish.

281
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,321
Mom, I'm not trying to kill you.

282
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:08,593
Yes, I want you to be alive
to see your grandchildren.

283
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:10,994
Your Jewish grandchildren, Mom.

284
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,967
No, I didn't know that you
wanted to be buried in Israel.

285
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:18,737
Mom, I'm not gonna talk about this
over the phone right now, okay?

286
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,405
I'll see you tomorrow.

287
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:22,941
I love you, too. Bye.

288
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,402
Hey, Dave. Hi, D.

289
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,874
Where's Mom?

290
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,377
I told you to hang it up, Dinah!

291
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,082
Hey, guys.

292
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,981
You left the bathroom light on this morning.

293
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,714
Jeff Rosenberg's son got engaged yesterday.

294
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,752
To a speech therapist.

295
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,128
Hey, boychik. Hi, Dad.

296
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:19,429
We have to talk about our
last phone conversation.

297
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:22,101
Mom. It's good to see you, too.

298
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,303
I'm not kidding around. Okay, I can...

299
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:26,175
I can just tell that this is gonna be...

300
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:28,238
some sort of disciplinary action, not a talk.

301
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:30,876
All right. We'll be sure
to make it a talk, then.

302
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:33,318
Now can you help your
sister set the table, please?

303
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:34,479
Sure.

304
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,716
And take the wine out of the fridge.

305
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,220
Has he called yet? The next night.

306
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,855
Nice. I know. I'm not used to this.

307
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:46,361
Did you guys make a plan to go out again?

308
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:47,992
He wanted to have dinner with me tomorrow night.

309
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:49,661
But I have a flight early Sunday morning.

310
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:51,671
When I told him I had to go to Paris, he goes:

311
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:53,229
"That's a bit drastic for a bad date.

312
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:55,138
"Do you really need
to leave the country?"

313
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,700
This kid's funny. Please
don't use that word.

314
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,973
Right, sorry. He's humorous.

315
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,446
What are you doing? Drinking.

316
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:11,718
He's having Scotch.
Mom, I'm 23. It's fine.

317
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,453
What, what, what?

318
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:17,190
Tomorrow, gonna go to
shul, gonna pray that everybody...

319
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,458
is gonna have a happy...

320
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,591
Dinah, you know, since you
told me about computers...

321
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,466
Mom, let him finish. He's finished.

322
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:25,633
I've become so...

323
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,071
Then why do you have to do this?

324
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:30,304
There are so many other women
that you could go out with.

325
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,603
And I've encouraged you to branch out...

326
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,808
in any other way that you
like, but just not this.

327
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,350
Why do you have to do this?

328
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:38,783
What do you mean, "do this"?

329
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:41,515
Do what? Incur the wrath of God?

330
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,580
Why are you getting yourself into trouble?

331
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:47,559
I'm not getting married, Mom.
I'm just seeing what's out there.

332
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:50,658
You make it out like we
live in the Warsaw ghetto.

333
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:53,791
It's the Upper West Side.
We're strong in numbers here.

334
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:56,234
So you're still planning
on marrying someone Jewish?

335
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,328
Yes. Sure. Okay?

336
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:02,904
But then I don't understand why
you need to go down this road.

337
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:04,911
You may end up getting hurt for nothing.

338
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:06,970
Or worse, hurting her.

339
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,807
Don't you value your culture and your history?

340
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,853
Well, it's not one or the other, Mom.

341
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,581
But if you're smart enough to know...

342
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:17,351
that it makes sense to marry
someone from the same background...

343
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:19,256
and it does, any of the
studies will show you that...

344
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:20,793
as far as the divorce rates go.

345
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:22,658
Then you should be smart enough to know...

346
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,698
not to start something
where nothing can come of it.

347
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,790
You're only going to make a mess.

348
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,798
I can't even believe what you're saying.

349
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,461
Do you hear what you're saying?

350
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,233
What? You're a therapist.

351
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,102
You would never tell that to a patient.

352
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,608
Not true, not true.

353
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:37,837
I encourage my patients to have relationships...

354
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:41,245
within their respective
faiths. It's easier.

355
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:45,716
I encourage them to go to
mosque, or church, or whatever.

356
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:50,989
I think religion is...

357
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,961
paramount in a person's life.

358
00:24:57,198 --> 00:24:59,723
Okay, well, yes...

359
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:03,796
but encouraging them is
different from discouraging them.

360
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,270
And I know that you draw the line there.

361
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,570
Would you tell one of your
patients not to date someone...

362
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,166
that they don't think they're gonna marry...

363
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:12,371
Oh, quit asking me what I tell my patients.

364
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:14,141
They're not my children.

365
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,707
How old is she?

366
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,151
She's 27. What?

367
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:25,087
She's four years older
than you? Oh, David.

368
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:28,224
Drop it now. It's only
going to end badly.

369
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:30,123
Maybe if you met her, you might think...

370
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,994
I'm not going to meet her. Oh, my God.

371
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,192
Are you out of your mind?

372
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,666
Mom, do you...

373
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:36,834
You sound like an after school special.

374
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,201
Don't do this.

375
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,267
I'm doing it.

376
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,140
On your own then.

377
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,782
Hey, what's up, man?

378
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:02,621
Cool.

379
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,756
Do you need anything or... No?

380
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:10,593
Go on up. She's expecting
you. Thank you. Give me...

381
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,005
Five? Thumbs up?

382
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,203
Smile? No?

383
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:17,208
We'll get there.

384
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:26,109
Hi. Hi.

385
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:30,016
Come on in.

386
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:37,697
Thanks for the soup. Yeah.

387
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:39,699
It's chicken noodle. It's hot.

388
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:42,894
Wow.

389
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,302
This place is huge.

390
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,767
I'm not even going to ask what you pay.

391
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:50,241
I don't want to know. It's Rothko.

392
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,705
I've never seen this one
before. What year is this?

393
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:55,214
1954.

394
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,980
It's probably my single favorite piece of art.

395
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,350
Yeah, I love how he never
titled any of his work.

396
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,725
It's beautiful. Luminous.

397
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,262
What is this?

398
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,568
Sentimental Mood.

399
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:23,642
You never heard Coltrane before? No.

400
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:26,945
What, am I in trouble now? No.

401
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:28,946
No, it's just...

402
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,012
He's a pretty famous jazz musician.

403
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,256
Oh. So, is this that Negro music
that everybody's talking about?

404
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,916
'Cause I had no idea.

405
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,102
I have to wake up in five hours.

406
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:59,669
Do you want me to go?

407
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,608
Take off your sweater.

408
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:07,410
Wait. Does this involve dancing?

409
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,388
'Cause my corns, they've been killing me and...

410
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:11,515
Take it off. It's coming with me.

411
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:14,924
All right.

412
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,431
I really like her.

413
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:29,669
She's only been gone two
days, she comes back tomorrow.

414
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:32,143
I miss her already. I
never felt this before.

415
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,873
It's just 'cause you haven't slept with her yet.

416
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,744
No, that's definitely not it.

417
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:38,546
I really like her, man.
I don't know, I mean...

418
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,781
I think I could love her. What?

419
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:44,119
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

420
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:47,851
Wait, what was I saying?

421
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:50,897
I don't know, man. There is
something about this girl...

422
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:52,625
Like, you know that feeling that you get...

423
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,258
when you're in a room with someone...

424
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:55,893
and even though you may not know them...

425
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:57,163
or understand them completely...

426
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,729
you just know that you're
in the presence of greatness?

427
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:03,374
You know? Like when you
come to my apartment.

428
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:05,344
And she old, man, she a time-fighter.

429
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,902
She's so fine, bro.

430
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:08,638
I don't know.

431
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:10,547
I just feel like it's gonna end badly, I do.

432
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:12,482
You sound like my mother. Yeah.

433
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:15,420
Hey, Morris! All right!

434
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:19,417
What the hell am I listening to you for?

435
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,427
I'm in a bakery shopping for a pie...

436
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:22,985
so you can put it in some girl's face...

437
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,758
who wouldn't let you get down her pants.

438
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:26,299
When was the cream pie made? Today.

439
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,356
Today? Yeah.

440
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,527
Nice. I'll take that one. Awesome.

441
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:33,162
So what's with Dave?

442
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,966
Is he really serious about this girl, or what?

443
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:37,169
I don't know.

444
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:38,973
So what is she? Catholic? Episcopalian?

445
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:40,513
I didn't ask.

446
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,945
Would you prefer one
denomination over another...

447
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:45,109
as far as the love of Christ goes?

448
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:49,022
Your father's gonna flip. Yeah.

449
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:51,847
And it's too bad your mom isn't around for this.

450
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,985
It would have gone over real big with her, too.

451
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,389
So, what are we gonna do?

452
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:02,858
I don't know.

453
00:30:21,622 --> 00:30:24,182
Have you ever had ikura with quail egg?

454
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,089
No. What is that?

455
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,493
I swear it's like having sex.

456
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,754
That's a bold claim. You want to try it?

457
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,061
How am I gonna say no now?

458
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,999
That's amazing. I know.

459
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:46,505
What?

460
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:58,716
So, how was your trip?

461
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:01,085
Who cares? Okay.

462
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:39,629
Well, this sounds really good.

463
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:42,399
That's what I'm hearing.

464
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,428
It was amazing.

465
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:47,435
He's really very sweet.

466
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,401
I didn't have an orgasm, though.

467
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,145
Completely normal.

468
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:57,673
There are so many trust issues there.

469
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,514
You just have to give it time.

470
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,679
I'm willing to do the work.

471
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,188
God damn it.

472
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,617
Do you still worry about his age?

473
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:08,922
Definitely.

474
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:11,590
I mean, I was thinking last
night, there are some countries...

475
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:14,463
where I could get arrested
for this. I mean, 23?

476
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:17,433
I thought you said he was 27.

477
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:19,933
Did I?

478
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:22,668
I did.

479
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,442
I'm sorry.

480
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,643
I lied to you about that.

481
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:30,478
Why do you think you lied?

482
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:31,779
I was...

483
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:34,316
I mean, I am embarrassed by his age.

484
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:36,253
I mean, he's just so young.

485
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,657
What does he do?

486
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,390
He's an artist.

487
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:42,654
I'm not an artist.

488
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:44,162
I thought you said you were a painter.

489
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:46,495
No. I said I like to paint.

490
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:50,059
But it's a hobby. I mean,
you have to work, too.

491
00:32:50,404 --> 00:32:53,305
He doesn't call himself
that, but that's what he is.

492
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,301
He has some issue with it.

493
00:32:57,511 --> 00:33:00,344
His family doesn't support
him in his work at all.

494
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:02,707
Hmm.

495
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,118
Where does he live?

496
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,080
Grand Street. Lower East Side.

497
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:10,384
I haven't been there yet.

498
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:13,426
He has roommates, and so
I'm not exactly running over.

499
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,191
Okay.

500
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,633
Our time is up.

501
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:24,466
And I will see you on...

502
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,437
On Monday.

503
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:28,939
Of course.

504
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:31,772
Are you okay?

505
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:34,177
Yes. No.

506
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:37,910
Yes. I mean, I'm fine,
because I have to be somewhere.

507
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,117
Okay. Bye. Bye.

508
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:52,727
Shit, shit, shit...

509
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,895
shit, shit, shit, shit.

510
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,091
Oh, shit.

511
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,859
So what the hell am I supposed
to do now, end treatment?

512
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,600
Keep going?

513
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,098
Bring them in for a couples session?

514
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,168
Well, if this doesn't go anywhere...

515
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,677
And I really don't think it will.

516
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:41,675
Then you'll be relieved you stayed with her now.

517
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,815
If you end her treatment...

518
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:46,580
and they break up after two weeks...

519
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:49,312
you will not have served her best interests.

520
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,484
So what are you saying? That
I should keep treating her?

521
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,323
If you think it's just a fling, yes.

522
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:58,592
But that sounds crazy.
Is that even ethical?

523
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,894
Your job is to help her.

524
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:03,735
That's your ethical boundary.

525
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,834
Okay.

526
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:13,469
Forgetting all the professional
implications of the moment...

527
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,637
how are you feeling?

528
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:20,018
I'm a wreck.

529
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:23,516
I'm a wreck.

530
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:28,454
Rita, she's not even Jewish.

531
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:32,762
If she were Jewish...

532
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:37,626
would you feel better about him
dating a 37-year-old divorcee?

533
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:47,975
Where are we going?

534
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,741
I just gotta stop by work for a second.

535
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:53,012
What's up, Gil? Hey, what's up, Dave?

536
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,485
How you doing, man? All right.

537
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:56,215
Did you set it up? Oh, yeah.

538
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,347
This is Rafi. Hi.

539
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:58,550
Pleasure. Gil.

540
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:16,599
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

541
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:20,303
Come here. Something
else I want to show you.

542
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:29,618
You've gotta be kidding me.

543
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:26,769
Go, go, go!

544
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,476
Quit ignoring me!

545
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,540
Come on, Dave, I'm open.

546
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:35,552
Get it in there!

547
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,958
Foul, man! Foul! Stay
off me. Stay off me.

548
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:52,004
I've told you twice
now. You've been warned.

549
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:05,974
Hi.

550
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,100
It's incredible. It's amazing.

551
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,175
I'm sorry, your bra is showing.
Is it missing a button there?

552
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:32,544
No. No. That's the way it is.

553
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,280
You were so right about Jewish men.

554
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,174
I mean, so attentive.

555
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:41,384
But, I mean, of course you
know. You're married to one.

556
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:43,513
Yes, but he has ADD.

557
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,056
I just can't get over it. I mean...

558
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,460
I feel a little awkward telling you this.

559
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,189
But I can't tell anyone
else. This is so...

560
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:58,801
We have had sex on every
surface of my apartment.

561
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,003
I mean, I haven't had much sleep.

562
00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:04,942
But he's just so eager to please me...

563
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,309
and I feel the same way about him.

564
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,206
He makes me want to do things...

565
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:13,008
I understand...that I've never...

566
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,480
wanted to do before. I got it.

567
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,152
You're gonna laugh...

568
00:39:18,224 --> 00:39:21,193
but he didn't actually
know where the clitoris was.

569
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,386
Really?

570
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:28,229
Did you show him? Of course.

571
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,462
I mean, he's so uninhibited.

572
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,567
Just happy to learn.

573
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,773
He hasn't had much experience.
He's only been with two other women.

574
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:38,333
What? He's had sex with two other women?

575
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,606
Yes. Can you believe that's it?

576
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,843
Now I know why men go after younger women.

577
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:45,979
There's something to it.

578
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,120
His youth, his body...

579
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:51,316
his naivete...

580
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:54,451
his goddamn eagerness. I mean...

581
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,460
Isn't this great?

582
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,794
Yeah. It's amazing.

583
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:01,928
Listen.

584
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:07,065
I just have to say this because I'm
too embarrassed to tell anyone else.

585
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:09,973
His penis...

586
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,574
is so beautiful, I just...

587
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:16,273
want to knit it a hat.

588
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,918
Did you ever think...

589
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:24,956
that I would be this satisfied?

590
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:27,883
I mean, sexually.

591
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:30,056
Not like this.

592
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:33,662
Are you using protection?

593
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:36,900
Oh, of course. He brought
it up. He's very responsible.

594
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,665
Oh, that's very good.

595
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:40,729
Is he neat? What?

596
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:44,366
Does he pick up after himself?
Does he make the bed in the morning?

597
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,674
Does he ask before he uses the phone?

598
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:48,774
Yes. Why?

599
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:53,680
Well, you can tell a lot
about a man from those things.

600
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:56,414
Yeah, he's very neat.

601
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,582
I mean, he does have some
unusual habits, though.

602
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,184
Hey, I'm not trying to freak you out here...

603
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:03,489
but these Q-Tips are amazing.

604
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:07,965
Guess what? You're freaking me
out. What are you talking about?

605
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:10,096
We never had these growing up.

606
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,230
I saw them in my Mom's
bathroom, but we never used them.

607
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:18,008
How'd you clean your ears?

608
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:21,605
Didn't. Just towel-dried them, I guess.

609
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:25,007
Let me see the Q-Tip. No.

610
00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:28,216
You have to get out of here.

611
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:34,089
What kind of mother doesn't teach
their child how to clean their ears?

612
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:35,592
Pediatricians say...

613
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,994
that it is unhealthy for children to use them...

614
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:39,929
because it can damage the eardrum.

615
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:42,832
And it has been shown that
a small amount of wax...

616
00:41:42,902 --> 00:41:45,700
in the inner canal helps
protect against larger debris.

617
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,172
I didn't know that. Well...

618
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:53,405
Sorry.

619
00:41:58,485 --> 00:41:59,645
I'm sorry.

620
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:03,153
Tell me what...

621
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,785
what it is that you're trying to say.

622
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:10,723
I'm just worried about where this is going.

623
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:15,301
You know, I want to give all
of myself. Just let it go.

624
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:16,699
It's so tempting.

625
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,035
I mean, it's all he wants from me.

626
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:23,041
Who wouldn't want all of you,
Rafi? You are an amazing woman.

627
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,866
But then I think...

628
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:28,947
I mean, he's just too young to
handle the responsibility. I...

629
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,614
I'm scared to put myself out like that.

630
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,156
That's a very mature line of thought.

631
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:41,187
I'm sure his intentions are pure...

632
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:44,691
but he doesn't sound like...

633
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:48,356
he knows exactly what it is he's getting into.

634
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:53,666
Do you think I should just cut it off right now?

635
00:42:57,177 --> 00:43:01,341
I'm not going to answer that.

636
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:07,477
Look, I don't want you to get...

637
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,488
the wrong idea about my family.

638
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,024
Sensitive subject? No.

639
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:16,288
Maybe.

640
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,561
All right, look.

641
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:22,667
I've been having trouble
with my mom concerning you.

642
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:24,763
Concerning me? Yeah.

643
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:29,632
It's just... I wanted her
to meet you and she said no.

644
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:32,738
That's sweet, but don't you think...

645
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,872
it's a little early to be
introducing me to your mother?

646
00:43:42,722 --> 00:43:45,316
She said no? Why? I...

647
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:49,957
Look, she has a problem
with you not being Jewish.

648
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:52,962
She won't meet me? No.

649
00:43:53,032 --> 00:43:56,024
Why do you think I'm so upset?
We're not even speaking right now.

650
00:43:56,102 --> 00:43:58,866
Well, I don't understand. I thought
you said she was a therapist.

651
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:01,133
I know. How do you think I feel?

652
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:04,006
Didn't she meet the black girl you dated?

653
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,237
No way.

654
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:07,074
No, my mother doesn't even know about that.

655
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:09,080
That was my bubi. My dad's mom.

656
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:15,885
David, love. Hey, bubi.

657
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:18,947
I wanted you to meet my girlfriend, Radjina.

658
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:20,754
Radjina, this is my bubi.

659
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:22,558
Hi.

660
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:33,135
Is she black?

661
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,102
It's really not that funny, okay?

662
00:44:40,546 --> 00:44:42,480
My bubi died three weeks later.

663
00:44:42,782 --> 00:44:44,750
And I know she didn't tell
anybody about Radjina...

664
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:46,546
but her reaction and her subsequent death...

665
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,917
let me know it might be a good
idea to keep that one quiet.

666
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:51,081
I swear, I think she went
in the house after that...

667
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:53,318
and just hit herself over
the head with the frying pan.

668
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:55,884
I mean, that's the image I get
whenever I'm doing something wrong.

669
00:44:55,962 --> 00:44:58,863
Just her, like, whacking away with the skillet.

670
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:03,163
I can say this much.

671
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,136
Age aside...

672
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:09,132
he gives me more of what I really need...

673
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,506
than anyone else ever has.

674
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:14,978
Real things.

675
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:17,281
Things I never got.

676
00:45:18,651 --> 00:45:20,619
It makes it hard to harp on age...

677
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:22,985
or religion or anything, because...

678
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:28,317
I'm just happy.

679
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,291
Yeah.

680
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:49,304
What's wrong, David?

681
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,415
I lost my job. I'm sorry.

682
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:55,752
Did you hear Josh Friedman
got engaged to a chef?

683
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:59,053
Yes, I heard. Truffle
matzo balls. Amazing.

684
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,890
You better tell him about the Kushners, Sam.

685
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:05,328
We're trading apartments with
the Kushners, starting August 1st.

686
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:06,660
In Miami?

687
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:09,864
You have to find someplace
else to live while we're gone.

688
00:46:09,936 --> 00:46:12,905
Oh, come on. Not now. This
is the worst possible time.

689
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:15,332
And who goes to Miami in August?

690
00:46:15,408 --> 00:46:16,568
That's what I said.

691
00:46:16,642 --> 00:46:17,904
Come on. What are you talking about?

692
00:46:17,977 --> 00:46:19,376
It's beautiful this time of year.

693
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:23,347
Grandpa, it's a sauna down there
and it rains every single afternoon.

694
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,350
The Kushners are taking you for a ride.

695
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:27,477
I told you, Sam. Oh, what does he know?

696
00:46:27,553 --> 00:46:29,544
It's a condominium. We're going.

697
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:32,352
What? Condominium means no rain?

698
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:53,772
Do you know where Raphael Gardet is?

699
00:46:56,115 --> 00:46:58,413
My dad's got this great place in Wainscott.

700
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:01,783
There's a limo waiting, so you
won't have to take the Jitney.

701
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:05,116
Excuse me. Do you know
where Raphael Gardet is?

702
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:08,257
Who are you? I'm Dave.

703
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:10,126
Hi, Dave.

704
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:12,792
Are you one of the models?

705
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,590
No. Are you the hairdresser?

706
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:17,727
Excuse me? I think you heard me.

707
00:47:18,438 --> 00:47:19,837
Diana, eyes to me.

708
00:47:20,406 --> 00:47:21,634
That's great.

709
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:25,771
Are you the hairdresser?

710
00:47:28,147 --> 00:47:30,877
That was good. I really enjoyed that.

711
00:47:34,754 --> 00:47:37,222
I just asked him simply, "Do you know where...

712
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,020
"Raphael Gardet is?" And he gives
me all this attitude like I'm some...

713
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:42,424
Whatever. Jesus, Dave. It's so uncool.

714
00:47:42,495 --> 00:47:44,292
The guy's a schmuck. Schmuck?

715
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,126
It's who I work for.

716
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:49,168
Who are you? What are you thinking?

717
00:47:50,136 --> 00:47:51,967
I got cut to one day a week at work.

718
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:54,029
Then I find out I gotta be
out of my place on Monday.

719
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:56,006
I'm gonna be broke in a month.

720
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,675
But I'm sorry, okay?

721
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,774
I am sorry.

722
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:10,519
Okay, let's do something.
It's Friday night.

723
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,218
What do you want to do? Start
observing the Sabbath or something?

724
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:14,281
No.

725
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,720
I wanna know what a normal
Friday night was like for you...

726
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:20,197
before you met me.

727
00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:22,698
I mean, you didn't sit around
fireplaces in The Village...

728
00:48:22,768 --> 00:48:24,463
drinking merlot, did you?

729
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:26,864
Actually, we stood
around trash-can fires

730
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,864
in the Bowery drinking 40s.

731
00:48:33,145 --> 00:48:34,669
Come on. What?

732
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:38,210
I wanna know what you did. Show me.

733
00:48:38,985 --> 00:48:40,646
Are you sure? Yeah.

734
00:49:14,754 --> 00:49:17,314
Let's go to your place.
We never go to your place.

735
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,722
I got roommates, Rafi. Rafi...

736
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,023
I wanna see your paintings.

737
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:26,122
You're not missing much.

738
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:28,264
Convenient and weak.

739
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:32,294
I wanna go, I wanna go right now.

740
00:49:32,371 --> 00:49:35,340
I want to see where you sleep
when you're not in my bed.

741
00:50:00,032 --> 00:50:01,499
This is nice.

742
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:11,065
Kitchen.

743
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:12,872
Very grown-up. Yeah.

744
00:50:23,689 --> 00:50:25,247
David? Yeah.

745
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:26,991
Who are your roommates?

746
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:28,954
Is that you, David?

747
00:50:30,863 --> 00:50:33,093
Yes. Go to sleep, Grandma.

748
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:40,572
Come on. Give me a break. It's
embarrassing enough, all right?

749
00:50:41,941 --> 00:50:44,569
Where's the bathroom?
Bathroom's right there.

750
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:49,173
- Did you eat?
- Yes, I ate. Good night.

751
00:51:06,932 --> 00:51:08,263
What are you doing?

752
00:51:09,035 --> 00:51:10,593
Stashing all your pornos?

753
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,503
Yeah, and all my posters had to come down, too.

754
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:26,208
Why are they all facing
away? I don't know.

755
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,110
Who wants to look at my paintings all day?

756
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:33,115
We have to talk...

757
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,728
about this thing you have with your art.

758
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:38,161
I mean, it's weird.

759
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:41,656
It's like you think it's a sin or something.

760
00:51:44,036 --> 00:51:45,094
Bubi?

761
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:48,135
I've decided I'm gonna be an artist.

762
00:52:12,865 --> 00:52:13,991
Dave.

763
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:16,634
You're really good.

764
00:52:17,002 --> 00:52:20,233
This is what you should be doing.
You've got to keep painting.

765
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:23,233
Yeah?

766
00:52:24,777 --> 00:52:26,142
It's not a life.

767
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:28,840
Says who? You're crazy.

768
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:55,899
You're lucky. I'm just
paving the way for you.

769
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,678
This is the curse of the eldest child.

770
00:53:00,246 --> 00:53:02,942
When it's all over you'll
be able to bring home Jay-Z.

771
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:05,449
Are you and Mom talking? Not really.

772
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:08,445
She's just a different person these days.

773
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:12,682
What are you doing? I'm just
dropping off some clothes.

774
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,653
You're not going to stay here?

775
00:53:15,427 --> 00:53:16,894
I'm going to Morris' place.

776
00:53:17,129 --> 00:53:19,654
To tell you the truth, I didn't
even think you'd want me here.

777
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:21,097
Don't be melodramatic.

778
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:23,098
This is your home. We're your family.

779
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,903
Even if you did bring home Jay-D.

780
00:53:26,238 --> 00:53:27,466
It's Jay-Z, Mom.

781
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:32,407
Whatever.
Jay-B, Jay-D...

782
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:35,905
I have a patient coming, so
be careful when you leave.

783
00:53:58,404 --> 00:54:02,602
Oh, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

784
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:04,609
Did I knock? Am I late?

785
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,308
I feel like I'm late.

786
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:11,439
But no. No.

787
00:54:11,984 --> 00:54:13,508
Sit, sit, sit.

788
00:54:15,387 --> 00:54:17,378
What is that? A gun?

789
00:54:17,456 --> 00:54:19,117
No, it's a yoga mat.

790
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:27,462
He's moving in with me. What?

791
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:33,202
I thought you said...
Weren't you just saying...

792
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:36,173
that he couldn't provide you
with the things that you needed?

793
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:37,709
I'm still unsure.

794
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:39,767
But I think I should just give it a shot.

795
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:42,906
I mean, you always say, "Just get messy in life.

796
00:54:42,982 --> 00:54:45,075
"At least you know
you're living." Right?

797
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:48,215
Besides, if he can't give me what I need...

798
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:50,585
then I'll find out sooner
if he's living with me.

799
00:54:51,957 --> 00:54:54,357
And he has nowhere to go. He said that?

800
00:54:55,361 --> 00:54:56,953
His best friend has a studio.

801
00:54:57,029 --> 00:55:00,123
He's not getting along with
his mother, so he can't go home.

802
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:03,163
She hates me, by the
way. Did I tell you that?

803
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:05,563
No. You hadn't mentioned it.

804
00:55:05,638 --> 00:55:09,497
Yes, it's this whole other thing...that
I'm trying not to even think about.

805
00:55:10,342 --> 00:55:12,105
They say the children of psychoanalysts...

806
00:55:12,177 --> 00:55:13,542
are the most screwed up of all.

807
00:55:14,113 --> 00:55:15,603
Yes, I had heard that.

808
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:18,710
So he's moving in.

809
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:20,481
I think it'll be fun.

810
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:22,383
That's what you said to do with this, right?

811
00:55:22,454 --> 00:55:24,422
I mean, just have fun.

812
00:55:24,924 --> 00:55:26,983
That's right. That's right.

813
00:55:27,092 --> 00:55:28,491
What are you looking at?

814
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,028
I... I forgot, I have a book...

815
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:35,094
A book... A book I wanted to show you.

816
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,498
Thought it might be...

817
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:38,729
"Lesbians and the Kabbalah...

818
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:40,396
"A Match Made in Heaven."

819
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,670
Wrong book. Wrong book. Wrong...

820
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:46,006
Oh, my. Oh, well, never mind.

821
00:55:49,982 --> 00:55:52,212
Forget it. I'm sorry.

822
00:56:00,225 --> 00:56:03,160
I am so late.

823
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:05,156
I can't help it if you parade around...

824
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,721
fulfilling every working-girl
fantasy I've ever had.

825
00:56:08,467 --> 00:56:11,300
You should wear a garbage bag
till you get to the elevator.

826
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:15,902
Hey, are we still going to the Hamptons Friday?

827
00:56:15,975 --> 00:56:17,602
Yeah. See you.

828
00:57:02,187 --> 00:57:04,348
Great. Village People weekend.

829
00:57:04,957 --> 00:57:06,117
You'll be fine.

830
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:07,715
I've been grooming you for this moment.

831
00:57:07,793 --> 00:57:12,253
A Bette Davis marathon on the Turner
Classic Network hardly qualifies.

832
00:57:12,331 --> 00:57:14,799
Hey, you guys, they're here. Come on.

833
00:57:18,003 --> 00:57:21,029
Hi. How are you? Hey, Jason.

834
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:24,604
You look great. You do, too.

835
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,300
Dave, this is Jason. Hi.

836
00:57:26,378 --> 00:57:27,845
Hi. We've heard all about you.

837
00:57:27,913 --> 00:57:29,437
Hi. Raphael!

838
00:57:30,315 --> 00:57:32,374
Hello. Hello.

839
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:35,513
It's so good to see you again.

840
00:57:35,854 --> 00:57:36,946
How are you? I'm good.

841
00:57:37,022 --> 00:57:38,319
How was the drive? It was good.

842
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:39,379
Good. Brilliant.

843
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,449
Palmer, this is Dave. Hi.

844
00:57:41,527 --> 00:57:43,859
How are you? Great. How are you doing?

845
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:45,226
Great. Yeah?

846
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:46,286
Is he okay? Or...

847
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:49,823
Ignore him. He's just jealous he
didn't get into your pants first.

848
00:57:51,904 --> 00:57:54,065
Hey, what's up?

849
00:57:54,173 --> 00:57:56,801
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

850
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,002
Alsayste, you junkie!

851
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:00,670
It's so he won't bark. Are you okay?

852
00:58:00,746 --> 00:58:02,008
Yeah. I think I'm blind.

853
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,276
Oh, no. Gotta call the pediatrician.

854
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:05,680
All right, come on.

855
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,320
- That stings.
- That's terrible.

856
00:58:12,357 --> 00:58:14,257
This place is amazing.

857
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:18,654
I mean, everything.
Every room is perfect.

858
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:23,029
Look at this. Even the beds are awesome.

859
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:27,999
We're gonna have vacation sex tonight.

860
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:30,132
What's vacation sex, Dave?

861
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:32,737
I don't know, but you're gonna get it, girl.

862
00:58:35,147 --> 00:58:37,547
Look at this, even the
breeze coming through here.

863
00:58:37,616 --> 00:58:38,776
This is perfect.

864
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:41,418
Is it like this for all rich people?

865
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:43,478
No, just gay rich people.

866
00:58:44,256 --> 00:58:45,814
You're gonna get it. Oh, yeah?

867
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:47,624
I'm gonna give it to you.

868
00:58:51,763 --> 00:58:53,458
Vacation sex, Dave?

869
00:58:58,537 --> 00:59:00,095
Please. You are the only...

870
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:01,696
registered gay Republican in New York.

871
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:03,138
It's just a tax thing.

872
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,937
I'm to the left on every other issue.

873
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,241
I still say the Democrats need their
own show pushing their own agenda.

874
00:59:08,313 --> 00:59:10,372
No one would watch. I
mean, there's no blood.

875
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:11,939
I'd watch that show.

876
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:14,884
People would much rather
watch some liberal be humiliated...

877
00:59:14,953 --> 00:59:16,318
on The O'Reilly Factor.

878
00:59:17,723 --> 00:59:19,088
You should go on, Jason...

879
00:59:19,158 --> 00:59:20,386
and thoroughly humiliate the man.

880
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:22,086
Sure, he'd love me.

881
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:24,721
Alsayste? Where is he? I'll get him.

882
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:34,533
Fiddler on a hot tin roof. And
so young. Have you carded him?

883
00:59:34,606 --> 00:59:37,006
Yes, unfortunately, I have.

884
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:40,135
I think he's great. Smart and
sweet. Just needs a little seasoning.

885
00:59:40,212 --> 00:59:41,201
I think he's...

886
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,805
You don't get to say. You're
totally infatuated with him.

887
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:46,248
Maybe, but I'm still worried about you.

888
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,310
He is so young and you're
obviously falling for him.

889
00:59:49,388 --> 00:59:51,754
- So what? Fall.
- What is wrong with you?

890
00:59:51,823 --> 00:59:54,257
You look 10 years younger.
I've never seen you this happy.

891
00:59:54,326 --> 00:59:55,987
I'm just saying, you want a baby...

892
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:57,858
and he is in no position to give you that.

893
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,694
You're on the clock, Rafi.
Thanks, Randall. That's sweet.

894
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:03,360
Plus, he has this weird
relationship with his mother...

895
01:00:03,435 --> 01:00:06,563
who wants him to marry someone
named Rivkah or Devorah.

896
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:07,696
Randall, who asked you?

897
01:00:07,773 --> 01:00:09,001
Besides, I think it's interesting...

898
01:00:09,074 --> 01:00:10,541
that you call their relationship weird...

899
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:12,600
when all it is, is close.

900
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:14,372
We should all be so lucky.

901
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,874
Besides, your mother still thinks
you're straight, for Christ's sakes.

902
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:23,615
So, Dave, do you care if your kids are Jewish?

903
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:28,692
I care if they're happy.

904
01:00:29,561 --> 01:00:30,687
Good answer.

905
01:00:32,831 --> 01:00:34,492
So, what's up with your friends?

906
01:00:34,566 --> 01:00:36,659
This whole weekend felt like a long audition.

907
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,260
They're just worried
about me. Worried about what?

908
01:00:39,338 --> 01:00:40,862
How old you are, I mean...

909
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,633
my wanting to have a child at some point.

910
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:45,336
Your moving in.

911
01:00:45,811 --> 01:00:47,802
And I'm just a little nervous, that's all.

912
01:00:48,347 --> 01:00:51,544
You know how it is in New York.
Your apartment's all you have.

913
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:54,850
A few hundred square feet you can call your own.

914
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,898
The work's strong, I mean,
it's realistic portraits...

915
01:01:07,966 --> 01:01:10,059
and he's only 23, I was amazed.

916
01:01:10,135 --> 01:01:13,434
Sounds great. I'd really like
to take a look at his work.

917
01:01:14,006 --> 01:01:16,270
Is he here? Yes, he is.

918
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:17,638
Great. He'd love that.

919
01:01:17,709 --> 01:01:18,801
Let me go find him. Okay.

920
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:24,046
I want you to see this. Come here.

921
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:26,343
Raphael.

922
01:01:27,286 --> 01:01:28,719
How are you, honey? How you doing?

923
01:01:28,787 --> 01:01:29,981
Good to see you. Nice to see you.

924
01:01:30,055 --> 01:01:31,454
Have you met my friend Ann?

925
01:01:31,523 --> 01:01:32,581
Hi.

926
01:01:32,658 --> 01:01:34,023
Nice to meet you.
I've got my hands full.

927
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:37,823
You sure do. Gosh, she's
beautiful. Thank you.

928
01:01:38,397 --> 01:01:40,058
What's her name? Ella.

929
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,997
You're so sweet.

930
01:01:43,835 --> 01:01:45,666
How old is she? She's one.

931
01:01:45,737 --> 01:01:48,262
Oh, my goodness. Yeah, she's a big girl.

932
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,773
Do you have any children?

933
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:51,536
No, I don't have any children.

934
01:01:53,345 --> 01:01:56,610
She's just started walking.
She's holding onto the railing...

935
01:01:58,417 --> 01:02:00,214
Oh, she's so sweet.

936
01:02:12,898 --> 01:02:14,024
Hey, baby.

937
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,889
Hey.

938
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:20,000
Do you know you have
over 500 channels on this thing?

939
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:22,165
I watched the Malaysian Grand Prix today.

940
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,708
Really? That's amazing.

941
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:29,275
Have you left the apartment since this morning?

942
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,941
No. Why?

943
01:02:35,454 --> 01:02:37,581
He sits around all day in my apartment.

944
01:02:37,656 --> 01:02:39,783
I have zero privacy when I go home.

945
01:02:39,858 --> 01:02:42,224
This does not sound good. He
needs to get his own place.

946
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:44,353
Yeah, but he needs a job first.

947
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:45,589
It's about time.

948
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:47,825
I need to buy him a birthday present this week.

949
01:02:47,899 --> 01:02:49,127
Do you have any ideas?

950
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:52,068
There's this Nintendo thing he
keeps on talking about and...

951
01:02:52,637 --> 01:02:54,161
Rafi, let me ask you something.

952
01:02:55,273 --> 01:02:56,535
Do you like having sex?

953
01:03:01,513 --> 01:03:02,741
Don't get Nintendo.

954
01:03:08,954 --> 01:03:10,080
Are you coming to bed?

955
01:03:11,056 --> 01:03:12,523
Yeah, right after this game.

956
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,891
Just for a sec.

957
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:25,297
Okay. What can it hurt?

958
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:28,032
I've got to get back.
We'll just look, all right?

959
01:03:33,879 --> 01:03:36,814
How much is this? Much
too much. Don't look.

960
01:03:36,882 --> 01:03:38,315
Don't even look.

961
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:04,239
May I help you? What?

962
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,207
May l... No.

963
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:35,672
Jack. What?

964
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,002
We have to go. Why?

965
01:04:37,075 --> 01:04:38,565
I have an appointment I forgot about.

966
01:04:38,643 --> 01:04:41,339
I thought you said you didn't...
I just have to go, all right?

967
01:04:41,413 --> 01:04:42,710
Why? Shit!

968
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,408
Get down, get down. Why?

969
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,486
- It's a patient?
- No, it's my lover.

970
01:04:51,556 --> 01:04:53,581
Yes, it's a patient. Just be quiet.

971
01:05:04,736 --> 01:05:07,864
You're gonna have to explain
this. You know I can't.

972
01:05:10,108 --> 01:05:12,542
Okay. You're scaring
some of the customers.

973
01:05:21,753 --> 01:05:23,380
Just dropped a contact.

974
01:05:30,295 --> 01:05:32,354
I was married to a man who couldn't love me.

975
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:35,359
And now I'm with someone who can love me...

976
01:05:36,368 --> 01:05:39,531
but he's not really a man.
At least, not all the time.

977
01:05:40,405 --> 01:05:41,872
I can see that.

978
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,206
Maybe if I give myself to him completely...

979
01:05:46,845 --> 01:05:48,972
he'll step up in the ways I need him to.

980
01:05:49,314 --> 01:05:51,646
He said he knows I'm not giving all of myself...

981
01:05:51,716 --> 01:05:53,115
and it's unfair to us.

982
01:05:55,921 --> 01:05:58,981
I don't think I can do this anymore.

983
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:01,456
I'm sorry.

984
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:04,390
I just can't.

985
01:06:04,663 --> 01:06:05,891
Do what?

986
01:06:12,737 --> 01:06:14,671
We need to talk, Rafi.

987
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:18,434
Okay.

988
01:06:18,877 --> 01:06:20,310
He's my son.

989
01:06:21,546 --> 01:06:22,604
Who?

990
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,866
Why does it say Lisa Metzger on your door?

991
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:55,503
Metzger is my maiden name.

992
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:00,884
You betrayed me.

993
01:07:03,254 --> 01:07:04,346
Yes.

994
01:07:05,323 --> 01:07:07,086
I did betray your trust...

995
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:10,491
but I did it to preserve our relationship.

996
01:07:10,562 --> 01:07:12,621
That seemed more important to me.

997
01:07:13,965 --> 01:07:16,456
Is this what you call
preserving our relationship?

998
01:07:17,469 --> 01:07:21,166
It seemed at the time
like the right thing to do.

999
01:07:21,806 --> 01:07:24,604
What do you mean, at the
time? How long have you known?

1000
01:07:26,611 --> 01:07:28,340
Five weeks, four days.

1001
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:31,705
I wanted to make sure that
it wasn't just a fling.

1002
01:07:31,783 --> 01:07:35,514
If it was, then we would have
been able to continue, but...

1003
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:37,921
Now we're having a conversation...

1004
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:41,015
that will very likely end our work together.

1005
01:07:41,626 --> 01:07:42,854
Can you see...

1006
01:07:42,927 --> 01:07:46,124
that I wanted to avoid
having this conversation...

1007
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:49,493
for your benefit?

1008
01:07:49,634 --> 01:07:52,865
No. I think you did it to
control your son's life.

1009
01:07:52,937 --> 01:07:55,235
No. That's not true. That is not true.

1010
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,700
I stayed in it just for you, no other reason.

1011
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,272
I don't believe you.

1012
01:08:01,046 --> 01:08:03,640
That you could give me
advice to do as I please...

1013
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:07,309
and then not do the same for your son is wrong.

1014
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:10,484
I think you need to look at that.

1015
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:14,553
Thank you. I am working on that
with my therapist right now.

1016
01:08:16,995 --> 01:08:20,055
You let me talk to you about his penis.

1017
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,902
Trust me, that was harder
for me than it was for you.

1018
01:08:27,672 --> 01:08:30,903
Up until a few weeks ago, I didn't
even think my son had a penis.

1019
01:08:34,512 --> 01:08:39,074
Do you realize your mother now knows
intimate details about your penis?

1020
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:41,885
You told her about my penis?

1021
01:08:43,388 --> 01:08:44,582
Jesus, Rafi.

1022
01:08:44,656 --> 01:08:45,884
Excuse me...

1023
01:08:45,957 --> 01:08:48,517
I thought it was safe to assume
it wouldn't get back to her.

1024
01:08:49,027 --> 01:08:51,461
She better not use that to
get me home for Thanksgiving.

1025
01:08:52,564 --> 01:08:55,533
How can you make jokes?
What else am I gonna do?

1026
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,262
Get angry! Be outraged!

1027
01:08:58,336 --> 01:09:00,429
I am, okay? I am angry.

1028
01:09:00,505 --> 01:09:02,200
I can't believe she took it this far.

1029
01:09:02,273 --> 01:09:05,242
I'm just... I know that she
cares about the people she helps.

1030
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,244
And she cares a lot.
What is wrong with you?

1031
01:09:07,312 --> 01:09:09,576
I have to draw the line
there. You're delusional.

1032
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:11,672
She's just trying to
control you. She still is.

1033
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,308
Rafi, I'm not arguing with you.

1034
01:09:13,384 --> 01:09:16,353
I know she tries to
control me. I hate it. I do.

1035
01:09:17,188 --> 01:09:18,177
But...

1036
01:09:18,923 --> 01:09:21,357
All I'm saying is, she would
never use you to do that.

1037
01:09:21,426 --> 01:09:23,451
You are so naive.

1038
01:09:24,696 --> 01:09:27,722
How could you deceive her like
that? That was totally unethical!

1039
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:32,062
How dare you? I care far more
about her well-being than you do.

1040
01:09:32,137 --> 01:09:35,732
That's evident by your choice
in continuing to see her.

1041
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:36,865
Mom.

1042
01:09:37,408 --> 01:09:38,705
What are you going to do now?

1043
01:09:39,577 --> 01:09:40,635
Live a life.

1044
01:09:40,712 --> 01:09:42,509
I hope you're making the right decisions...

1045
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,707
because you've got somebody
else counting on you now.

1046
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:47,081
That's fine. I can
handle it. I love her.

1047
01:09:47,152 --> 01:09:50,019
Great. Just don't come to me,
help you clean up the mess.

1048
01:09:50,088 --> 01:09:51,214
I won't.

1049
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:54,122
I mean, there won't be a mess to clean up, Mom.

1050
01:09:54,459 --> 01:09:56,689
And I didn't buy you Q-Tips...

1051
01:09:56,928 --> 01:09:59,396
because I was trying to protect your ears.

1052
01:10:10,508 --> 01:10:12,476
So what? She's just gonna
let you live there rent-free?

1053
01:10:12,544 --> 01:10:14,671
No, it ain't free. I'm
paying in other ways.

1054
01:10:14,746 --> 01:10:16,213
Oh, my God, you're my hero.

1055
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:17,839
No, it's not like that.

1056
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:19,941
This whole thing with my
mother has just killed her.

1057
01:10:20,018 --> 01:10:22,452
She's, like, impossible to live with these days.

1058
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:25,287
This is it. You wanna wait outside or...

1059
01:10:25,356 --> 01:10:27,756
No, I thought I'd stand next
to you with some paper towels.

1060
01:10:27,826 --> 01:10:29,054
I'll meet you back at Rafi's.

1061
01:10:29,127 --> 01:10:30,219
I want you to check out her place.

1062
01:10:30,295 --> 01:10:32,422
She's not going to be
back for a couple of hours.

1063
01:10:32,497 --> 01:10:34,727
Can't believe you haven't made Page Six yet.

1064
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:39,927
You know what? This place
is sick. I know.

1065
01:10:40,004 --> 01:10:42,029
Now I understand why you're taking all her shit.

1066
01:10:42,106 --> 01:10:43,403
That's not why.

1067
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:47,173
I mean, I like living here, but
that's not the reason I'm with her.

1068
01:10:48,947 --> 01:10:52,815
Great apartment, friends with houses
in the Hamptons, art connections.

1069
01:10:52,884 --> 01:10:54,681
Those are good reasons.
You know what I mean?

1070
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:55,980
Shut up. What?

1071
01:10:56,054 --> 01:10:58,716
Come on, man, she's got you
tied up like it's Pelican Bay.

1072
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:02,084
Seriously, I barely even see you anymore.

1073
01:11:02,293 --> 01:11:05,091
You even said it. I'm only here
right now because she's not home.

1074
01:11:11,636 --> 01:11:12,830
Shit.

1075
01:11:12,904 --> 01:11:15,372
It's her. Come on. You've got to hide.

1076
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,271
Are you serious? I really can't be here?

1077
01:11:17,342 --> 01:11:19,037
Yeah. No. Get in the
closet. In the closet?

1078
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:21,578
Get in the closet. She doesn't
like people in her living space.

1079
01:11:21,646 --> 01:11:23,273
Living space? What the
hell's living space?

1080
01:11:23,348 --> 01:11:25,282
Is the kitchen part of
it? Just get in the closet.

1081
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,339
Jesus Christ.

1082
01:11:33,191 --> 01:11:34,180
What's up?

1083
01:11:36,761 --> 01:11:38,592
What are you doing home already?

1084
01:11:38,997 --> 01:11:41,192
Oh, I'm sorry. Would
you like me to leave?

1085
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,831
I thought you were hanging
out with Morris today.

1086
01:11:45,103 --> 01:11:48,004
Oh, yeah, drink that.
That's good stuff, huh?

1087
01:11:48,072 --> 01:11:49,801
I was. I mean, I am.

1088
01:11:50,308 --> 01:11:51,468
I mean, hanging out...

1089
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:53,169
What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

1090
01:11:53,244 --> 01:11:55,610
Me? No, I'm fine. You okay?

1091
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:01,717
Is there someone here? What? No.

1092
01:12:03,288 --> 01:12:05,313
Oh, my God, is there someone here with you?

1093
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:13,990
I'm allergic to...

1094
01:12:14,065 --> 01:12:15,965
What is going on here? Okay, okay...

1095
01:12:16,901 --> 01:12:18,459
All right, look.

1096
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:21,361
We were only here for a few
minutes. Then I heard you coming...

1097
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:23,669
and I panicked, and I told him to hide.

1098
01:12:23,942 --> 01:12:25,967
In the closet? I told
him it was a bad idea.

1099
01:12:26,044 --> 01:12:27,875
Rafi, we were only here just...

1100
01:12:27,946 --> 01:12:31,404
Long enough to have a beer with
your pie-throwing, sociopath friend?

1101
01:12:31,482 --> 01:12:34,849
Wait. Hey, hey. No. Wait. I told him...

1102
01:12:35,386 --> 01:12:37,183
I told you not to come up, but you forced me.

1103
01:12:37,255 --> 01:12:38,415
No, you did not. You lie...

1104
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:39,888
Wait, wait, wait.

1105
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,949
Is that better or worse than a psychopath?

1106
01:12:42,026 --> 01:12:43,789
What is wrong with you?

1107
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:46,019
I can't believe I have to come home to this.

1108
01:12:46,097 --> 01:12:48,565
People hiding in the closet, you're lying.

1109
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:50,601
You're a goddamn preschooler, Dave!

1110
01:12:50,668 --> 01:12:52,863
You've had me on lockdown since
the minute I moved in here.

1111
01:12:52,937 --> 01:12:53,926
What? Yeah.

1112
01:12:54,005 --> 01:12:56,838
You tell me you want me here and
then you treat me like an inmate.

1113
01:12:56,908 --> 01:13:00,071
An inmate? I mean, you barely
carry your weight around here, Dave.

1114
01:13:00,144 --> 01:13:03,011
I do everything and you
can't even clean up the place.

1115
01:13:03,348 --> 01:13:04,781
The one thing I ask of you...

1116
01:13:04,849 --> 01:13:07,283
is that you would tell me
when you bring someone here.

1117
01:13:07,352 --> 01:13:09,718
Rafi, this is not such a big deal, okay?

1118
01:13:09,787 --> 01:13:11,118
You need to get over it.

1119
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:13,555
I'm not Francis.

1120
01:13:13,624 --> 01:13:16,286
I'm not lying to you.
I'm not cheating on you.

1121
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:18,226
I'm definitely not avoiding you. Thanks.

1122
01:13:18,296 --> 01:13:21,231
That's reassuring and in
really, really good taste.

1123
01:13:24,302 --> 01:13:25,826
You know what? I...

1124
01:13:26,804 --> 01:13:28,066
I can't do this anymore.

1125
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:29,902
You should get a dog if you wanna give orders...

1126
01:13:29,974 --> 01:13:32,135
'cause I really don't give a shit anymore!

1127
01:13:33,478 --> 01:13:34,467
Let's go.

1128
01:13:52,964 --> 01:13:54,522
I missed you like crazy.

1129
01:14:00,605 --> 01:14:03,904
I think we need to take a break,
Dave, and start seeing other people.

1130
01:14:06,444 --> 01:14:07,536
What?

1131
01:14:10,715 --> 01:14:14,116
I can't do this. This
just isn't right for me...

1132
01:14:15,553 --> 01:14:17,453
and I can't trust you anymore.

1133
01:14:17,922 --> 01:14:20,186
I was only showing him your
place for a minute. I just...

1134
01:14:20,258 --> 01:14:21,589
It's not just that.

1135
01:14:26,097 --> 01:14:29,260
You're in no place to give me what I need.

1136
01:14:30,635 --> 01:14:31,863
I get that.

1137
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:34,127
And then this whole thing with your mother...

1138
01:14:34,205 --> 01:14:35,763
I don't even know what to say about that.

1139
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,034
It's crazy.

1140
01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:40,468
But just think the reason
she stopped seeing you...

1141
01:14:40,545 --> 01:14:42,809
is because she believes that we're in love.

1142
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:50,843
It's just...

1143
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:54,658
It's just not gonna work
out. At least, not now.

1144
01:14:57,061 --> 01:14:58,494
So that's it?

1145
01:15:04,602 --> 01:15:05,694
Rafi.

1146
01:15:19,984 --> 01:15:21,975
You don't look as relieved as you predicted.

1147
01:15:23,287 --> 01:15:25,915
Are you kidding? I'm devastated.

1148
01:15:27,225 --> 01:15:31,594
I hurt my patient so that she could
have a relationship with my son.

1149
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:33,527
And so what happens?

1150
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:35,588
My son hurts my patient.

1151
01:15:36,901 --> 01:15:38,266
And now...

1152
01:15:38,703 --> 01:15:41,501
my patient hurts my son.

1153
01:15:44,976 --> 01:15:47,706
I'm totally confused about my part in this.

1154
01:15:47,778 --> 01:15:50,406
I think you did the right thing, Lisa.

1155
01:15:50,948 --> 01:15:52,813
You know, even love won't guarantee...

1156
01:15:52,884 --> 01:15:55,079
that they're not going to hurt one another.

1157
01:15:55,153 --> 01:15:57,951
If anything, it just makes it a likelihood.

1158
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,603
Thanks for coming down.

1159
01:16:14,038 --> 01:16:16,063
Sorry the place is such a mess.

1160
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:19,667
Rafi thought I'd like your
work and I trust her judgment.

1161
01:16:20,044 --> 01:16:21,636
Yeah, well, we broke up.

1162
01:16:23,047 --> 01:16:25,038
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1163
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,450
She didn't say anything about it? No.

1164
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:40,658
These are great.

1165
01:16:40,932 --> 01:16:42,866
Do you have a gallery? No.

1166
01:16:43,834 --> 01:16:45,324
How much for the larger pieces?

1167
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,165
I don't know. I never sold one before.

1168
01:16:48,573 --> 01:16:50,734
I'll give you $1,000 each for these two.

1169
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,934
And I'll see what I can do
about getting you a show.

1170
01:16:56,214 --> 01:16:57,306
Done.

1171
01:16:59,483 --> 01:17:00,507
I don't believe it.

1172
01:17:00,585 --> 01:17:03,452
You're gonna be a huge painter
and I get to go along for the ride.

1173
01:17:05,856 --> 01:17:08,416
Maybe I can write this whole
pie thing off as performance art.

1174
01:17:08,492 --> 01:17:09,823
What do you think?

1175
01:17:10,628 --> 01:17:11,788
Who you calling? Rafi.

1176
01:17:11,862 --> 01:17:13,523
Why? I want to tell her how it went.

1177
01:17:13,598 --> 01:17:15,964
Plus I want to kick her a few
bucks for the time I spent there.

1178
01:17:16,033 --> 01:17:17,864
She'll appreciate it.
What am I, chopped liver?

1179
01:17:17,935 --> 01:17:20,267
I'm gonna pretend you didn't
say that. You're the reason...

1180
01:17:20,338 --> 01:17:22,238
- All right, all right.
- I'm not in right now.

1181
01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:24,035
Does this mean you're gonna
get your own place now?

1182
01:17:24,108 --> 01:17:25,370
Shut up. Thanks.

1183
01:17:26,544 --> 01:17:28,978
Hey, Raff, it's me again. Listen...

1184
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,614
I have some amazing news
for you. Please pick up.

1185
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:34,311
Rafi, Rafi.

1186
01:17:34,919 --> 01:17:36,079
Hello?

1187
01:18:13,424 --> 01:18:15,187
Why don't you call him, then?

1188
01:18:33,377 --> 01:18:36,938
I like it, man. It's very
The Early Years, you know?

1189
01:18:37,648 --> 01:18:39,843
A little roach problem, but you can fix that.

1190
01:18:40,718 --> 01:18:43,152
It's gonna look good when A&E
comes to shoot the documentary.

1191
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,380
He lived on rugalach and macaroons...

1192
01:18:44,455 --> 01:18:46,184
for the first four years
during his Blue Period...

1193
01:18:46,257 --> 01:18:47,315
Would you shut up?

1194
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:48,415
...and then moved on to the Louvre.

1195
01:18:48,492 --> 01:18:50,892
All right, Howard Hughes. Tell
me to shut up again. Get dressed.

1196
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:52,087
Let's go. Let's get it moving around.

1197
01:18:52,163 --> 01:18:53,687
I wanna go out. I want you to look nice.

1198
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:55,698
You've been shut in too
long. Let's go. Pick it up.

1199
01:19:05,543 --> 01:19:07,010
We're with her. No, you're not.

1200
01:19:07,078 --> 01:19:09,012
What? Come on, man, that's
my girlfriend right there.

1201
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,104
Back off the rope.

1202
01:19:14,218 --> 01:19:15,207
Hey.

1203
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,155
Hold the goddamn mayo.
You know that chick?

1204
01:19:21,225 --> 01:19:22,283
Yeah. Don't point. Sorry.

1205
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,452
What's wrong?

1206
01:19:24,362 --> 01:19:25,693
We can't get in.

1207
01:19:25,763 --> 01:19:28,664
Hey, it's okay. Come on. Let them in.

1208
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:35,363
I love you, okay? I really do.

1209
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:37,737
But if you don't take
advantage of this situation...

1210
01:19:37,808 --> 01:19:40,038
I'm gonna seriously question your manhood.

1211
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:42,543
I miss her.

1212
01:19:42,913 --> 01:19:44,471
Get over it, okay?

1213
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:45,981
It's been two weeks.

1214
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:48,177
You don't think she's out
here doing the same thing?

1215
01:19:49,887 --> 01:19:52,219
I'm thinking
the pan-seared trout.

1216
01:19:53,324 --> 01:19:55,485
What about the salmon? Looks good, too.

1217
01:19:56,794 --> 01:19:58,659
Do you think it's wild or farm-raised?

1218
01:20:00,164 --> 01:20:02,632
Do you like carp? No.

1219
01:20:09,173 --> 01:20:10,538
I wanna dance.

1220
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,206
Go get to work, sister.

1221
01:20:12,676 --> 01:20:14,701
Come on, shake it like
a salt shaker. Go ahead.

1222
01:20:23,387 --> 01:20:24,854
What is that?

1223
01:20:25,556 --> 01:20:26,580
What is that? No, no.

1224
01:20:26,657 --> 01:20:29,956
That's like some Irene Cara shit.
She ought to be wearing leg warmers.

1225
01:20:30,227 --> 01:20:31,626
All right, you gotta do damage control.

1226
01:20:31,695 --> 01:20:34,220
Yeah. This is not helping anybody. Go.

1227
01:20:39,703 --> 01:20:41,227
Have a drink, baby.

1228
01:20:48,078 --> 01:20:49,443
Feel better?

1229
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:51,373
Much.

1230
01:20:53,951 --> 01:20:54,940
Yes!

1231
01:21:06,163 --> 01:21:08,028
I'm going to use your toothbrush.

1232
01:21:08,098 --> 01:21:09,360
That's okay, right?

1233
01:21:10,835 --> 01:21:12,063
Oh, my God.

1234
01:21:12,636 --> 01:21:13,728
What?

1235
01:21:25,316 --> 01:21:26,442
Dave.

1236
01:21:27,184 --> 01:21:29,914
Yeah. Do you believe in Jesus Christ?

1237
01:22:50,067 --> 01:22:51,227
You're painting.

1238
01:22:52,169 --> 01:22:53,500
I'm working.

1239
01:23:00,177 --> 01:23:02,168
I'm not doing this to piss you off, Mom.

1240
01:23:02,246 --> 01:23:04,214
This is not an act of rebellion.

1241
01:23:04,281 --> 01:23:06,181
I love her. I'm trying to make it work.

1242
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,274
I could really use your help.

1243
01:23:07,351 --> 01:23:10,013
My help. Have you even
heard a word I've said?

1244
01:23:10,087 --> 01:23:11,384
I am out of this.

1245
01:23:12,823 --> 01:23:14,723
Just let me bring her over Friday night.

1246
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:16,692
Please. Mom, I'm begging you.

1247
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:18,519
She doesn't stop talking about you.

1248
01:23:18,596 --> 01:23:20,655
How much she misses you and all this stuff.

1249
01:23:20,731 --> 01:23:22,358
Are you insane?

1250
01:23:23,267 --> 01:23:24,564
There is no way.

1251
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:58,127
You okay?

1252
01:24:06,677 --> 01:24:08,508
Mom? We're here.

1253
01:24:12,182 --> 01:24:13,513
Rafi.

1254
01:24:20,557 --> 01:24:23,082
What? What is it, sweetie?

1255
01:24:23,727 --> 01:24:25,217
I missed you.

1256
01:24:25,963 --> 01:24:27,692
Now I just realized how much.

1257
01:24:31,635 --> 01:24:33,262
I missed you, too.

1258
01:24:33,771 --> 01:24:35,932
Did you? Yes.

1259
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:38,906
Hello, sweetheart. Hi, Mom. Thank you.

1260
01:24:40,544 --> 01:24:42,569
You look very nice. Okay.

1261
01:24:43,447 --> 01:24:44,607
Coats.

1262
01:24:46,116 --> 01:24:47,413
What? Oh, yeah.

1263
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:50,780
Jack. Ma, can Audrey come over?

1264
01:24:50,854 --> 01:24:53,414
No, no, no. Get off the phone.
Would you get off the phone?

1265
01:24:58,529 --> 01:25:00,827
All right, Dad, this is Rafi.

1266
01:25:01,065 --> 01:25:02,327
Hi! Hi!

1267
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:03,832
Nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you.

1268
01:25:03,901 --> 01:25:05,698
This is my sister, D.
Hi! Dinah.

1269
01:25:05,769 --> 01:25:07,396
Hi! I like your dress.

1270
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:10,331
I heard so much about you. Yeah?

1271
01:25:10,674 --> 01:25:12,904
Hi, I'm Blanche. She's my mother.

1272
01:25:12,976 --> 01:25:14,307
And you are? Rafi.

1273
01:25:14,378 --> 01:25:16,642
Rafi. What a nice name. Thank you.

1274
01:25:16,714 --> 01:25:18,272
It's for Raphael, actually.

1275
01:25:18,849 --> 01:25:20,214
Just like the painter.

1276
01:25:20,784 --> 01:25:23,116
Painter? My husband, Sam.

1277
01:25:23,187 --> 01:25:25,018
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you.

1278
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:26,181
Watch out for him.

1279
01:25:29,059 --> 01:25:30,185
That's the truth.

1280
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,057
Hope you're hungry. Yeah.

1281
01:25:33,063 --> 01:25:37,193
Oh, my... You shouldn't have. Thank you.

1282
01:25:37,267 --> 01:25:40,202
Thank you very much. What a cute bag.

1283
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,500
It's a nice bottle, too. Look at that.

1284
01:25:42,573 --> 01:25:45,474
If it gets cold enough, we
can drink it with dinner.

1285
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:46,975
Mom. Absolutely.

1286
01:25:47,044 --> 01:25:49,205
Put it in the freezer for 10 minutes.

1287
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,042
It'll be fine.

1288
01:25:54,818 --> 01:25:55,807
Thank you.

1289
01:25:55,886 --> 01:25:58,946
God bless my daughter. I honestly
don't know where I'd be without her.

1290
01:25:59,022 --> 01:26:01,183
In Brooklyn, Sam. You'd be in Brooklyn.

1291
01:26:02,726 --> 01:26:04,591
This is you next to me.

1292
01:26:05,462 --> 01:26:07,555
This is beautiful. You okay, Grandma?

1293
01:26:07,631 --> 01:26:10,464
Like I have a choice? You're
okay till you collapse.

1294
01:26:11,702 --> 01:26:13,602
I have to tell you a wonderful story.

1295
01:26:14,404 --> 01:26:18,307
First time I met my
Blanche. In the subway.

1296
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:21,435
There used to be an elevated line
that ran across De Kalb Avenue.

1297
01:26:21,512 --> 01:26:22,979
I was on one side of the car...

1298
01:26:23,046 --> 01:26:24,911
she was on the other side of the car.

1299
01:26:24,982 --> 01:26:28,008
And she is wearing the dopiest
hat you ever saw in your life.

1300
01:26:28,085 --> 01:26:29,347
She looked terrific.

1301
01:26:29,419 --> 01:26:31,353
I feel like I've heard this story once before.

1302
01:26:31,421 --> 01:26:33,048
Only once? You're lucky.

1303
01:26:36,493 --> 01:26:38,620
It's an adorable story.

1304
01:26:39,696 --> 01:26:40,720
I like this.

1305
01:26:40,798 --> 01:26:43,596
How great is it that David sold his paintings?

1306
01:26:43,667 --> 01:26:46,500
Yes, we're so happy for him.

1307
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:48,003
Yeah, right. What?

1308
01:26:48,071 --> 01:26:49,868
I never thought you had a chance in hell.

1309
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:50,998
There you go.

1310
01:26:51,942 --> 01:26:54,706
Oh, Dad, really. Anyway, you should...

1311
01:26:54,845 --> 01:26:58,106
You should all know that this is what I'm
gonna be doing...for the rest of my life.

1312
01:26:58,515 --> 01:26:59,743
Really?

1313
01:26:59,817 --> 01:27:02,012
No CPA. No law degree.

1314
01:27:02,753 --> 01:27:05,347
No, "Paging Dr.
Bloomberg," Dad. This is it.

1315
01:27:05,422 --> 01:27:07,549
I suppose you can make a living out of it.

1316
01:27:11,261 --> 01:27:14,697
So, I understand you're interested
in converting to Judaism.

1317
01:27:14,765 --> 01:27:16,960
Oh, my God.

1318
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:22,138
Good, thank you. Sure.

1319
01:27:24,775 --> 01:27:26,834
Does this go in here? Yes.

1320
01:27:29,513 --> 01:27:31,310
Okay, good. That's good.

1321
01:27:41,592 --> 01:27:45,153
This is very strange. Yes,
it is... I would say, yeah.

1322
01:27:45,662 --> 01:27:49,860
Certainly never experienced
anything even remotely like it.

1323
01:27:52,169 --> 01:27:56,606
So now you've seen that even
your therapist has a crazy family.

1324
01:27:58,108 --> 01:28:00,838
Are you kidding? This
is what I never had.

1325
01:28:00,911 --> 01:28:04,506
You know, no grandparents. No
laughter around the dinner table.

1326
01:28:05,115 --> 01:28:06,776
No dinner, actually.

1327
01:28:14,491 --> 01:28:16,425
Thank you for having me over.

1328
01:28:18,295 --> 01:28:20,456
I know this was very difficult for you.

1329
01:28:20,731 --> 01:28:22,665
No, it wasn't difficult at all.

1330
01:28:33,043 --> 01:28:34,635
I think you're great, Rafi.

1331
01:28:35,913 --> 01:28:37,505
I think you're great.

1332
01:28:38,248 --> 01:28:41,684
I know this is hard for you to
understand, but this isn't personal.

1333
01:28:42,252 --> 01:28:47,121
I just don't want my son
giving up on his faith so early.

1334
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,680
But he wouldn't have to.

1335
01:28:48,926 --> 01:28:51,326
I would want my kids to
have a religious upbringing.

1336
01:28:51,395 --> 01:28:54,228
You know I didn't have one. You
always said I suffered from it.

1337
01:28:55,332 --> 01:28:56,959
Slow down. You...

1338
01:28:57,634 --> 01:29:00,159
Kids? With my son?

1339
01:29:01,505 --> 01:29:03,735
Rafi, think about what you're saying.

1340
01:29:03,807 --> 01:29:05,138
I'm sorry.

1341
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:09,004
Sometimes I forget that you're his mother.

1342
01:29:10,547 --> 01:29:12,708
I still think of you as my therapist.

1343
01:29:23,527 --> 01:29:24,926
What a mess, huh?

1344
01:29:27,431 --> 01:29:30,594
You know what else? He had, like,
20 boxes of Q-Tips in his bathroom.

1345
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:33,465
Meanwhile, the rest of the
place is a complete dump.

1346
01:29:34,671 --> 01:29:37,003
Wait a minute. This is
Dave you're talking about?

1347
01:29:37,474 --> 01:29:38,463
Rafi's Dave?

1348
01:29:38,542 --> 01:29:40,237
Yeah? So what? They're broken up.

1349
01:29:40,377 --> 01:29:43,813
Listen to me, Sue. Rafi and
Dave are back together now.

1350
01:29:45,215 --> 01:29:47,649
Okay, so they're back
together. What's the big deal?

1351
01:29:47,718 --> 01:29:50,186
The big deal is, it would kill her.

1352
01:29:50,253 --> 01:29:52,687
Okay. Jesus, I won't say anything.

1353
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:55,385
You won't say anything about what?

1354
01:30:05,635 --> 01:30:06,624
Hey.

1355
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:15,501
Did you sleep with Sue?

1356
01:30:17,481 --> 01:30:18,573
What?

1357
01:30:55,752 --> 01:30:56,776
You know what?

1358
01:30:56,853 --> 01:30:59,287
Just call her already and go
back to your own place, please.

1359
01:30:59,589 --> 01:31:01,750
I need quiet time. Thank you.

1360
01:31:02,192 --> 01:31:04,683
No, I'm not going to
call her. This is crazy.

1361
01:31:04,761 --> 01:31:06,228
She tells me to see other people...

1362
01:31:06,296 --> 01:31:08,355
and then she punishes me for taking her advice?

1363
01:31:08,432 --> 01:31:09,763
Screw that.

1364
01:31:11,835 --> 01:31:16,295
You know what? Come on, even I can
see that it's not that you went out.

1365
01:31:16,673 --> 01:31:17,935
It's who you went out with.

1366
01:31:19,843 --> 01:31:22,471
It's, like, Learn Your
Fucking Lesson Day around here.

1367
01:31:24,381 --> 01:31:25,814
Jesus Christ.

1368
01:31:36,693 --> 01:31:38,217
Lock the door, please.

1369
01:31:39,262 --> 01:31:40,422
Thank you.

1370
01:31:42,966 --> 01:31:46,060
Magnolia. Traitors.

1371
01:31:48,772 --> 01:31:53,038
You have my total support
in whatever you want to do.

1372
01:31:53,443 --> 01:31:56,310
Then why do I feel
like you're still against this?

1373
01:31:57,114 --> 01:32:01,278
I'm not. I am worried. I'm your mother.

1374
01:32:01,351 --> 01:32:02,511
That's my job.

1375
01:32:02,752 --> 01:32:04,913
What if I decide to go through with this?

1376
01:32:04,988 --> 01:32:09,357
Sweetheart, you clearly have
something special, you two.

1377
01:32:09,926 --> 01:32:13,384
I look at this relationship and
I think what it's done for you.

1378
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,227
It's really... It's great.

1379
01:32:17,734 --> 01:32:19,861
You are... I mean,
you've come into your own.

1380
01:32:19,936 --> 01:32:21,665
You're a painter. I get that.

1381
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,264
Rafi made me see that.

1382
01:32:25,642 --> 01:32:27,473
That is going to be your life.

1383
01:32:27,544 --> 01:32:30,342
That's right. That's
right. That's great.

1384
01:32:31,448 --> 01:32:34,781
But, David, you have to try to hear this.

1385
01:32:35,485 --> 01:32:38,477
Love is not always enough.

1386
01:32:38,989 --> 01:32:41,651
Not when you're talking
about marriage and children...

1387
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:43,352
and joint checking accounts.

1388
01:32:43,426 --> 01:32:47,385
You're not supposed to learn
this lesson at 23, maybe...

1389
01:32:47,464 --> 01:32:50,956
but you did get yourself
into a complicated situation.

1390
01:32:51,034 --> 01:32:52,058
Mom.

1391
01:32:54,905 --> 01:32:56,998
Relationships are work.

1392
01:32:57,073 --> 01:32:58,472
Children...

1393
01:32:59,509 --> 01:33:00,999
are work.

1394
01:33:01,478 --> 01:33:04,811
And I'm not saying love
isn't important. It is, but...

1395
01:33:06,716 --> 01:33:09,879
So what are you saying?
I'm saying that...

1396
01:33:15,358 --> 01:33:18,589
Sometimes you love and you learn.

1397
01:33:19,396 --> 01:33:20,920
And you...

1398
01:33:22,632 --> 01:33:23,894
move on.

1399
01:33:26,303 --> 01:33:27,565
And that's okay.

1400
01:33:55,432 --> 01:33:56,763
Here we go.

1401
01:34:25,795 --> 01:34:26,784
Whoops.

1402
01:34:31,635 --> 01:34:33,000
I'm sorry.

1403
01:34:37,807 --> 01:34:38,865
And?

1404
01:34:39,109 --> 01:34:41,009
And it was a really...

1405
01:34:41,678 --> 01:34:44,374
really bad call and I wasn't thinking.

1406
01:34:44,848 --> 01:34:47,146
I'm so sorry, Rafi. I'm just...

1407
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:51,543
learning this stuff as I go along,
but you gotta work with me here...

1408
01:34:51,621 --> 01:34:53,020
because...

1409
01:34:54,324 --> 01:34:55,791
Can we get a minute here?

1410
01:34:55,859 --> 01:34:57,383
No way. I work here.

1411
01:34:58,395 --> 01:35:00,192
Fine. I'm going anyway. Look.

1412
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:04,095
Rafi, we might have some
things working against us...

1413
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:08,001
and I do screw up from time to
time, but so does everybody else.

1414
01:35:08,805 --> 01:35:10,966
The difference with me is I am actively...

1415
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:13,032
I'm trying so hard to get it right.

1416
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:16,272
And I wanna be the man that
you see in me every so often.

1417
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,077
Okay, on leap years, fine. But
I wanna be that guy for you.

1418
01:35:21,318 --> 01:35:22,945
Bottom line is...

1419
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:25,685
I love you so much.

1420
01:35:29,693 --> 01:35:31,684
I'll figure it out, okay?

1421
01:35:32,896 --> 01:35:35,888
I'll get it. You just
gotta give me a chance.

1422
01:35:56,853 --> 01:35:59,378
Are you sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure.

1423
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:00,684
Why now?

1424
01:36:02,192 --> 01:36:04,251
'Cause you want this more
than anything in the world.

1425
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:06,251
And I wanna give it to you.

1426
01:36:08,164 --> 01:36:09,654
I wanna make a baby with you.

1427
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:13,129
I can't.

1428
01:36:15,839 --> 01:36:16,897
Why?

1429
01:36:18,742 --> 01:36:21,575
Because I love you and I can't do this to you.

1430
01:36:21,911 --> 01:36:24,141
I don't understand.
What are you doing to me?

1431
01:36:25,181 --> 01:36:27,081
It actually feels really good.

1432
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,780
I just can't.

1433
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:35,981
I wanna give this to you.

1434
01:36:41,998 --> 01:36:43,488
I know you do.

1435
01:36:44,134 --> 01:36:46,898
And it's the sweetest gift
anyone's ever given me.

1436
01:36:48,872 --> 01:36:50,362
But it's not right for you.

1437
01:36:51,741 --> 01:36:53,174
You'll regret it.

1438
01:36:54,477 --> 01:36:55,774
You know this.

1439
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,307
The fact that you're still willing...

1440
01:36:59,382 --> 01:37:01,976
just shows how deep your love goes.

1441
01:37:05,889 --> 01:37:08,016
That's the gift I'm taking from you.

1442
01:38:04,581 --> 01:38:06,378
I think I only need to sell one more painting...

1443
01:38:06,449 --> 01:38:07,916
then I'll have enough to get out of here.

1444
01:38:07,984 --> 01:38:09,679
What? Where you gonna go?

1445
01:38:10,286 --> 01:38:13,722
I was thinking about somewhere in
Central America. Maybe El Salvador.

1446
01:38:13,957 --> 01:38:16,221
You're just gonna pick up and go to El Salvador?

1447
01:38:17,193 --> 01:38:18,592
Yeah. I don't understand.

1448
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:21,528
You get there, you get off the
plane. How do you know where to go?

1449
01:38:21,831 --> 01:38:23,560
I don't. I'm going to figure it out.

1450
01:38:23,633 --> 01:38:25,362
It's time for me to try something like this.

1451
01:38:25,435 --> 01:38:26,959
I've never even left the country before.

1452
01:38:27,036 --> 01:38:28,867
Excuse me. What about Class Trip '98?

1453
01:38:29,305 --> 01:38:30,897
What, Niagara Falls? Yeah.

1454
01:38:30,974 --> 01:38:32,805
Come on, Morris. What?

1455
01:38:33,643 --> 01:38:36,237
Well, man, what am I gonna
do? You should come with me.

1456
01:38:36,312 --> 01:38:38,177
No. El Salvador? Yeah.

1457
01:38:38,248 --> 01:38:40,478
That's Noriega country,
amigo. I'm gonna pass on that.

1458
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:42,609
No, that's Panama, and
you might learn something.

1459
01:38:42,952 --> 01:38:44,476
I'm learning right here.

1460
01:38:44,554 --> 01:38:46,681
I went on a second date with
this girl the other night.

1461
01:38:46,956 --> 01:38:47,945
You're kidding me.

1462
01:38:48,024 --> 01:38:50,584
Yes, I am. But I had you for
a second, didn't I? I had you.

1463
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,025
Oh, shit. What?

1464
01:38:52,862 --> 01:38:55,160
I forgot my hat at the
restaurant. Oh, you schmuck.

1465
01:38:55,498 --> 01:38:57,591
You want me to come with you?
No, that's cool, I'll get it.

1466
01:38:57,667 --> 01:38:58,725
All right, man. I love you, brother.

1467
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:00,200
I'll catch up with you. All right, man.

1468
01:39:18,988 --> 01:39:21,286
You forgot your hat. Yeah.

1469
01:39:25,828 --> 01:39:27,227
There you go. Thank you.
