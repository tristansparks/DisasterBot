516
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,781
You too skinny.
I'm not too skinny.

517
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:53,284
Remember how you used to eat
when you were little?

518
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:54,385
Chuga, chuga, chug, chug.

519
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:56,087
With your hands.
Yes, I remember.

520
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:59,257
Now, did you or did you not
write to each other?

521
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:00,291
To your father?

522
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:01,659
No, to Clark Gable.

523
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:04,262
Yes, to Dad.

524
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:08,432
I, uh...

525
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,636
What, Mom?

526
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:14,839
Before your father...

527
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:17,441
Yeah?

528
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:21,645
There was this boy.

529
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:25,083
Did you love him?

530
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,618
Yeah.

531
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:32,891
Well...

532
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:34,425
Why...? Why didn't you
marry him?

533
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,830
So that you could ask me
this question someday.

534

(♪)

535
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,977
Looks smaller.

536
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:57,181
Uh, when did he complete it?

537
00:33:58,217 --> 00:34:00,785
You weren't born yet,
and I was 8.

538
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:05,489
God.

539
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:07,658
Corbusier meets
Frank Lloyd Wright.

540
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:11,296
You know, Dad played cards
with both of 'em.

541
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:14,332
Sharing a joint.

542
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:15,333
Yeah, well...

543

ALEX:
Can't swim.

545
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:21,605
There should be a stairway
down to the water,

546
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:23,441
a porch, a deck.

547
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:26,644
Here, you're in a...
In a box.

548
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:30,114
A glass box with a view
to everything that's around you,

549
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:31,782
but you can't touch it.

550
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:36,321
No interconnection between
you and what you're looking at.

HENRY:
I don't know, you know.

552
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,657
He's got this big maple growing

553
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,059
right in the middle
of the house.

554
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,360
Containment.

555
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:49,467
Containment and control.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

557
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:55,873
This house is about ownership,
not connection.

558
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:59,877
I mean, it's beautiful.
Seductive, even.

559
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:02,847
But it's incomplete.

560
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:06,351
It was all about him.

561
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:08,652
(THUNDER CRASHING)

562
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:11,055
Dad knew how to build
a house, not a home.

563
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:13,424
But you know,

564
00:35:13,426 --> 00:35:16,594
I think he wants us to do
what he couldn't.

565
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:19,930
But admitting that...

566
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:24,335
would mean admitting that
he came up short in some way,

567
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,404
that he could do more.

568
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:28,672
And that tortures him.

569
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:32,310
Do you remember
being here with Mom?

570
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:41,219
I remember she tried
to make it work here...

571
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,389
with us...

572
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:46,590
with him.

573

Hey, what about
Visionary Vanguard?

574
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,529
What about it?

575
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,231
Come on.

576
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,099
You can't convince me
you're gonna be happy

577
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:57,268
building these saltboxes
for tourists.

578
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,204
Nobody's gonna admire you
for that.

579
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:01,205
Admire me for that?

580
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:03,307
Yeah, Visionary Vanguard.

I can't.
But you can keep the name.

584
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:10,614
No, come on.
It's gotta be you and me.

I can't. I...

What?

Nah... Mm, no.

591
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:27,698
What is that?
You hesitated.

592
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,067
No, I didn't hesitate.

593
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:33,271
Come on, man. I don't have...
I don't have any time for that.

594
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:36,074
What does time
have to do with it?

595

Good afternoon.

1067
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:37,430
I'm looking for my father.

1068
01:00:37,432 --> 01:00:38,798

Fortunately, relatively minor.

1077
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:56,949
His vitals are fine,
and he's stable,

1078
01:00:56,951 --> 01:00:59,352
but it will require
an intervention.

1079
01:00:59,354 --> 01:01:01,988

for tomorrow.

1097

1101

<i>and the house was a gift</i>
<i>for her.</i>

1102
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,501
<i>She was smart and funny.</i>

1103
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:22,735
<i>She could've done anything,</i>

1104
01:02:22,737 --> 01:02:25,305
<i>but chose to take care</i>
<i>of my brother and I</i>

1105
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:27,507
<i>and help him build his career.</i>

1106
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:29,209
<i>You see, the more successful</i>
<i>he became,</i>

1107
01:02:29,211 --> 01:02:31,578
<i>the more impossible he was</i>
<i>to live with.</i>

1108
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:35,548
<i>Finally, she just couldn't take</i>
<i>living with him anymore.</i>

1109
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:38,685
<i>She left him.</i>

1110
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:41,020
<i>Within a year, she got sick.</i>

1111
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:45,925
<i>Unfortunately, she never</i>
<i>learned how to stop loving him.</i>

1112
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:49,662
<i>He wasn't at the funeral.</i>

1113
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:51,497
<i>When I asked him why...</i>

1114
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:00,039
Go on, Alex.
What did he say?

1115
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:05,545
He said, "She was dead to me

1116
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:07,747
the moment she stepped
out of the house."

1117
01:03:11,184 --> 01:03:12,184
And then he gave me

1118
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:15,020
one of his

1119
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:31,988

01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:40,930
It should be, but it isn't.

1124
01:03:40,932 --> 01:03:44,868
Ah... Mm.

1125
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,603
That's not bad.
Thank you...

1126
01:03:47,605 --> 01:03:49,472

1127
01:03:49,474 --> 01:03:50,473
You're welcome.

1128
01:03:50,475 --> 01:03:52,642
Where's your brother?

1129
01:03:52,644 --> 01:03:55,078
I sent him away.
He wasn't feeling well.

1130
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,946
You know how he is.
He worries.

1131
01:03:56,948 --> 01:03:58,181
Yeah, I know.

1132
01:03:58,183 --> 01:04:00,383
He gets that from your mother,
I'm afraid.

1133
01:04:00,385 --> 01:04:02,719
She always worried too much.

1134
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:04,154
What are you looking at?

1135
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:05,155
Hm?

1136
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:07,157
Oh, yeah, here, take a gander.

1137
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:10,359
It's a proposal for a museum.

1138
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:11,895
Who is it?

1139
01:04:11,897 --> 01:04:14,831
Oh, someone new.

1140
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:18,334
Oh, I like the walkways,
where the light falls.

1141
01:04:18,336 --> 01:04:20,103
What are the materials?

1142
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:22,572
Granite. Aluminum.

1143
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:25,075
White panels
are straight out of Meier,

1144
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:27,543
but the interior color coming
through the front windows,

1145
01:04:27,545 --> 01:04:30,413
that's different.

1146
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:33,983
It's not new,
but it's clean, uncluttered.

1147
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:35,852
I like it.

1148
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:39,322
When was the last time
you were in Barcelona?

1149
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:43,760
Years ago, with you,
Mom and Henry.

1150
01:04:43,762 --> 01:04:46,495
Do you remember visiting
Casa de la Caritat?

1151
01:04:47,564 --> 01:04:49,398
The almshouse.
Mm-hm.

1152
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,068
That's right.
You mentioned Meier.

1153
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:54,904
His Barcelona museum
stands in the same area

1154
01:04:54,906 --> 01:04:57,173
as Casa de la Caritat.

1155
01:04:57,175 --> 01:04:59,375
It drinks the same light.

1156
01:04:59,377 --> 01:05:03,046
Meier designed
a series of louvered skylights

1157
01:05:03,048 --> 01:05:04,513
to capture that light

1158
01:05:04,515 --> 01:05:07,617
and cast it inward
to illuminate the art within,

1159
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,518
but indirectly.

1160
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,754
And that was important,

1161
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:14,323
because although light
enhances art,

1162
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:16,059
it can also degrade it.

1163
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:18,561
But you know all that already,
you son of a...

1170
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:29,538

1171
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,041
Now, come on.

1172
01:05:32,043 --> 01:05:34,744
You know as well as I do
that the light in Barcelona

1173
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:37,446
is quite different
from the light in Tokyo.

1174
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:40,750
And the light in Tokyo is
different from that in Prague.

1175
01:05:40,752 --> 01:05:42,986
A truly great structure,

1176
01:05:42,988 --> 01:05:46,956
one that is meant
to stand the tests of time,

1177
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:49,659
never disregards
its environment.

1178
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:51,661
A serious architect
takes that into account.

1179
01:05:51,663 --> 01:05:53,629
He knows
that if he wants presence,

1180
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:56,599
he must consult with nature.

1181
01:05:56,601 --> 01:05:58,968
He must be captivated

1182
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,137
