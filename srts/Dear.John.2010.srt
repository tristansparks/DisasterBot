1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,216
<i>There's something I wanna tell you.</i>

2
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,512
<i>After I got shot...</i>

3
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,683
<i>...you wanna know the very first thing</i>
<i>that entered my mind...</i>

4
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,977
<i>...before I blacked out?</i>

5
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,482
<i>Coins.</i>

6
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,905
<i>I'm 8 years old again</i>
<i>on a tour of the U.S. Mint.</i>

7
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,992
<i>I'm listening to a guide explain</i>
<i>how coins are made.</i>

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,620
<i>How they're punched</i>
<i>out of sheet metal.</i>

9
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,997
<i>How they're rimmed and beveled.</i>

10
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,833
<i>How they are stamped and cleaned.</i>

11
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,670
<i>And how each and every batch</i>
<i>of coins are personally examined.</i>

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,133
<i>Just in case any have slipped through</i>
<i>with the slightest imperfection.</i>

13
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,177
<i>That's what popped into my head.</i>

14
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,181
<i>I am a coin</i>
<i>in the United states Army.</i>

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,562
<i>I was minted in the year 1 980.</i>
<i>I've been punched from sheet metal.</i>

16
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,523
<i>I've been stamped and cleaned.</i>

17
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,484
<i>My ridges have been rimmed</i>
<i>and beveled.</i>

18
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,781
<i>But now l have</i>
<i>two small holes in me.</i>

19
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,867
<i>I'm no longer in perfect condition.</i>

20
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,412
<i>So there's something else</i>
<i>I wanna tell you.</i>

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,207
<i>Right before</i>
<i>everything went black...</i>

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,752
<i>...you wanna know the</i>
<i>very last thing that entered my mind?</i>

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,047
<i>You.</i>

24
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,285
Why not? Because there are
a lot of things you'd be doing.

25
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,412
Just like playing tennis.

26
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,916
Wimbledon? I don't know.

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,009
Just gonna go.
I'm gonna host the thing. Six-thirty.

28
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,677
And you and I could go at 10?

29
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,888
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, no!

30
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,140
- Oh, no, Randy, no!
- I'm sorry.

31
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,143
I'll get it, I'll get it,
I'm on it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,436
Okay? I'm on it.

33
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,937
My whole life is in that bag.

34
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,356
I got it. I got it.

35
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,088
You got it.

36
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,599
Dude. I was gonna get that.

37
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,392
I mean, thanks for jumping in.

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,602
Yeah, no problem.

39
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,104
But I mean, hey, I'll take it.

40
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,607
Thank you so much!

41
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,486
Who jumps off a 20-foot pier?

42
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,574
Gosh, I'm a mess.
You are a lifesaver. I'm Savannah.

43
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,618
- John.
- John.

44
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:09,998
Brave man. This is my life in here,
so I owe.. I owe you.

45
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,208
Don't worry about it.

46
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,418
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,045
You all have a good night.

48
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,423
Yeah, thanks.
I was in the water for that.

49
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,718
I was seriously getting it for you.

50
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,179
This guy's crazy.

51
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,809
Yeah, no, I swear I'm not. I'm not
stalking you. I just gotta get my board.

52
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,271
- Are you staying here?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm from around here.

53
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,024
Hey, John, do you want to--?
My house is right over there.

54
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,861
We were actually going back
right now. Do you want to join us?

55
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,113
We're having a barbecue.

56
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,408
It's okay. I don't want to intrude
on y'all. My dad's making dinner.

57
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,076
Okay.

58
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:50,455
Well, I could at least give you
a beer for the walk home.

59
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,710
- Where is it?
- Right over there.

60
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,697
- You in the military or something?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,907
Really?

62
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,201
What branch are you in?

63
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,662
Army, Special Forces.

64
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,917
Oh, Special Forces.
That's impressive. That's....

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,590
Is that like a Special Forces ring they
give you? ls that what it says on it?

66
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,675
It looks nice on you.

67
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,304
Aren't you supposed to be wearing
a hat too? Like a French hat, a beret.

68
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,222
- That's what it's called?
- Randy.

69
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm just joking with him.

70
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,561
You shouldn't make fun of a guy
who can kill you with his bare hands.

71
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,898
Big guy.

72
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,359
Rock them, sock them, let's go.

73
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,069
How about that?

74
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,364
You know, I'm gonna go get a beer.

75
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,283
Soldier. Pleasure.

76
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,249
I'm sorry about him.
He thinks he likes me.

77
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,460
Yeah, I think he likes you too.

78
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,798
No, I'm not his type.
He just doesn't know it yet.

79
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,137
What?

80
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,808
Come on, I just think
you're probably everybody's type.

81
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,019
See what I mean?

82
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:40,816
Is this who I think it is? Alan, Alan.

83
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,903
Hey, buddy, I want you to meet John.
John, this is Alan.

84
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,489
- Alan, nice to meet you.
- Say hi.

85
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,658
He's a little bit shy, isn't he?

86
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,326
Hey, where's your dad?

87
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,288
- Over there.
- Two steps behind, as usual.

88
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,834
Sorry, he's like a heat-seeking missile
every time he sees you.

89
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,627
- Oh, hey, I'm Tim.
- John.

90
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,920
Sorry.

91
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,296
Nice to meet you.

92
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,340
Oh, you Special Forces, huh?

93
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,883
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,220
You stationed out at Fort Bragg?

95
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,140
No, Germany, actually.

96
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,684
- Oh, you're on leave.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,310
I hope you're enjoying yourself.

98
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,771
Yeah, I think I am.

99
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,443
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
It's nice to meet you though.

100
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,030
- Nice to meet you too.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

101
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,285
Let's go.

102
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,829
Hello. Hello, John.

103
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,456
Hello, Alan.

104
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,714
- Wow, that was really amazing.
- Yeah?

105
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,550
He never talks to anybody.
Only his family.

106
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,885
He talked to you.

107
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,097
Yeah, but I'm practically his family.
I've known him since he was born.

108
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,724
Yeah?

109
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,984
When do you go back?

110
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,611
Two weeks.

111
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,906
It must be scary what you do.

112
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,785
Boring mostly.
You know, long stretches of boring.

113
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,538
Occasional flashes of scary.

114
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,582
Full moon tonight.

115
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,923
Do you ever notice how big
the moon is when it's rising?

116
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,511
And how little it gets
when it's up in the sky.

117
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,680
You know,
that's just your perspective.

118
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,892
It doesn't matter where it is
in the sky or where you are...

119
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,103
...if you hold your hand up
and close one of your eyes...

120
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,315
...it's never bigger than your thumb.

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,614
Where'd you learn that?

122
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,282
I don't know.

123
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,576
Somewhere.

124
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,254
You just made your own fire.

125
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,674
That's very impressive.

126
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,425
Very primal.

127
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,557
But you're still not gonna
be able to cook that hot-dog, I fear.

128
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,559
I fear that as well.

129
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,312
I should probably
be getting going anyways.

130
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,317
I'm sorry. I hope you don't get into
too much trouble.

131
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,820
I think it's probably too late for that.

132
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,905
Yeah.

133
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,825
Thank you.

134
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,995
Yeah. No, you're welcome.

135
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,002
Would you wanna maybe
do this again tomorrow night?

136
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,005
Tomorrow is chicken.
I don't think you're gonna wanna try it.

137
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,592
I was kind of hoping maybe we'd let
somebody else do the cooking.

138
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,385
Type of thing.

139
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,013
- Okay.
- Yeah?

140
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,768
So maybe I'll come by around
6 or something?

141
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,855
- Okay.
- All right.

142
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,194
So I'll see you soon, then?

143
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,779
I'll see you soon, then.

144
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,782
Yeah. Soon.

145
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,961
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

146
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,131
We're headed into town
for some ice cream. You want a ride?

147
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,385
No, no, no, it's fine.
I don't mind walking at all. It's fine.

148
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,679
Sure?

149
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,309
- All right. I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,186
Hey, Alan, move on over here.

151
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,646
Here, I'll undo your belt.

152
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,985
Five, six, seven, eight...

153
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,529
- So how long are you in town for?
- ...nine.

154
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,073
We live here year-round now.

155
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,076
Yeah, we were driving down
every weekend anyways...

156
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:05,538
...so I finally just convinced my wife
this just made the most sense.

157
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,416
- She didn't want ice cream?
- Who?

158
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,170
Oh, my wife. No.

159
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,798
No, actually
she's on vacation herself.

160
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,592
White sheep, white sheep,
white sheep.

161
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,096
- It's difficult to take trips together.
- White sheep.

162
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,808
It's fine. We make it work.

163
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,228
I'm up here on the left.

164
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,198
Hey, John.

165
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,827
For the record,
if you do anything to hurt Savannah...

166
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,121
...I'm gonna
have to break something.

167
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,750
Something in your leg.
Some.. One of the bones in there.

168
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,877
Okay.

169
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:58,299
It's just I know her father and he would
expect me to say something like that.

170
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,220
It'd just sound a lot more natural
coming out of his mouth.

171
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,266
It sounded fine.

172
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,309
- No, it..
- Yes, it did.

173
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,353
- No, it didn't.
- It did. It really did.

174
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,771
It didn't. But thank you.

175
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,857
- It really did.
- You think so?

176
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,316
Yeah, it did.

177
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,985
Okay.

178
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,198
Hey, don't honk the horn,
it's nighttime.

179
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,745
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Tim.

180
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,332
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah, no problem.

181
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,206
Hey, Dad, I'm not gonna be able
to stay for dinner.

182
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,625
Well, I made lasagna.

183
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,377
I know you made lasagna.
It's Sunday.

184
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,714
Can I borrow the car?

185
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,183
Thanks.

186
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,980
- Best seafood you'll ever have.
- Yeah, I know.

187
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,107
- I used to come here all the time.
- Really?

188
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,152
Are you sure you don't wanna go
somewhere, I don't know, nice?

189
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,988
Nice? No, I wanna go
somewhere good.

190
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,990
Okay.

191
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,037
What the hell you doing here?

192
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,417
Come on, Steve.
It's been three years already.

193
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,212
I don't want any trouble here.

194
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,840
You're not gonna get any. I promise.

195
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,342
All right.

196
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,927
Thank you.

197
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,308
What happened
with that guy out there?

198
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,519
- What guy?
- What's the story with him?

199
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,104
- No story.
- Really?

200
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,355
Yeah.

201
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,691
He's an old buddy of mine.

202
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,237
What?

203
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,746
Your dad get mad at you
for coming home late last night?

204
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,960
No. He's not really the type
that gets mad.

205
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,795
What kind of guy is he then?

206
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,132
Quiet one?

207
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,928
- Could be worse, I guess.
- I guess.

208
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,930
And your mom?

209
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,808
Nope, just me and my dad.

210
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,853
Did he raise you all by himself?

211
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,647
Yeah.

212
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,567
Why do you wanna know
about my dad?

213
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,319
Just curious.

214
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,988
Curious about
where you come from.

215
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,829
I wanna meet your dad.

216
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,998
Tonight.

217
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,590
Look, you're-- You're not
gonna get very much out of him.

218
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,927
So, I don't know,
just don't take it personally, okay?

219
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,598
Hey, Pop.

220
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,476
I got somebody I want you to meet.

221
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,270
Hey.

222
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,106
- This is Savannah.
- Hi.

223
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,734
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Tyree.

224
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,366
He.. This is my.. He collects coins.
He.. It's kind of like his big hobby.

225
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,534
This is amazing.

226
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,121
You have so many coins.
How did you get started in all this?

227
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,874
Through John, actually.

228
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,418
Not his thing anymore.

229
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,381
- Hey, we should probably maybe go.
- What is this coin?

230
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,134
That's a Sacagawean mule.

231
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,761
It's actually....

232
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:20,395
- Do you want to see some more?
- Absolutely, yes, if you don't mind.

233
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,606
- Put this glove on then.
- Thanks.

234
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,237
This is a humorous one.
This is a satirical coin.

235
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,446
This is massive.

236
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,366
Yeah, William Jennings Bryan,
when he ran for president...

237
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,703
...he was.. He believed in..
No, don't turn it over.

238
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,121
Leave it here.

239
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:42,375
Do you remember that he had
the free silver policy. You remember.

240
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:47,672
And McKinley was his opponent
and he's.. Wait, here.

241
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,260
Now see, that's a real silver dollar.
That's the size of a silver dollar.

242
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,264
And McKinley said that if
Bryan had his way...

243
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,934
...then the silver dollars
would be that big. Yeah.

244
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,103
- That's amazing.
- Can you imagine...

245
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,772
...walking around with that
in your pocket?

246
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,233
- That's really funny.
- That's humorous.

247
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,695
Now, these..

248
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,781
Pop, we can't do this right now.
We can't be here all night.

249
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,867
I have.. I have some to show you.

250
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,618
This is fascinating.

251
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,204
These are all matched in color.

252
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,962
I had fun tonight.

253
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,466
I like your dad.

254
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,968
You shouldn't be too hard on him.

255
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,428
He loves you.

256
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,139
I can tell even if you can't.

257
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,981
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Wait, Savannah. I mean....

258
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,983
So I guess I'll see you soon, then?

259
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,402
I'll see you soon, then.

260
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,193
Where you been all day?

261
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,863
- I've been busy.
- You're on spring break.

262
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,533
You're supposed to be
lounging on the beach all day.

263
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,410
You're not supposed to be busy
doing things.

264
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,497
I want to show you something.

265
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,670
The family that lived here, their home
was damaged by the hurricane.

266
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,799
- What, so now you're rebuilding it?
- Yup. Well, not just me.

267
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,176
You're starting to make me
a little nervous.

268
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,720
Why am I
starting to make you nervous?

269
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,559
Because I'm starting to think you
might be too good of a person for me.

270
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,811
No, I'm not that good of a person.

271
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,983
You're sneaking off every day to do
manual labor on a house for charity.

272
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,069
- On your spring break.
- Yeah, you're right.

273
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,865
It's selfish, really,
me being this generous.

274
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,536
- You don't drink, you don't smoke.
- Nope. Nope.

275
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,248
- You probably don't sleep around.
- Absolutely not.

276
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,918
Okay, look, you gotta have a fault.

277
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:35,006
- I do.
- Okay, care to enlighten me?

278
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,926
I curse.

279
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,429
- No.
- I do.

280
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,680
- No, you don't.
- I do.

281
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:47,101
- I haven't heard you.
- Well, that's because it's in my mind.

282
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,188
There's a never-ending stream
of curse words...

283
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,939
...that I'm thinking at all times.

284
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,275
Okay, fine, just say one then.

285
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,444
No, I can't tell you because it's filthy.

286
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,362
- Right.
- Yeah.

287
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,615
Okay, all right. Fair enough.

288
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,783
No, I have faults, John.

289
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,412
Trust me, I have plenty of them.
You'll see.

290
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,456
I hope so.

291
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,919
We have to be finished
with this in three weeks.

292
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,670
Hope that actually happens.

293
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,964
These are to be the bedrooms,
parents' room...

294
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,301
...the boys' rooms,
two boys, 7 and 9.

295
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,345
Living room and the bathroom.

296
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,722
And then this is the kitchen.

297
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,600
This is the best room because
the mom's a really good cook.

298
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:33,314
We're gonna make it really beautiful
with white tile floors and tiles...

299
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,360
...on the counter tops
and there's gonna be a roof.

300
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,863
- Here, John, come here.
- A roof would definitely be good.

301
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,660
It's gonna be like this,
but it's gonna be everywhere.

302
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,370
It's the only cover we have.

303
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,122
Nice, we're gonna be here
for a while.

304
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,501
Where'd you get your scar?

305
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,795
That one?

306
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,092
A knife fight.

307
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,846
It was five years ago, we were really
drunk and the guy went for my eye.

308
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,265
That's terrible.

309
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,976
Why? He missed.

310
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,357
The way people act around you, the
way they treated you at that restaurant.

311
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,319
- It's like they're scared of you.
- They're not scared of me.

312
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,447
They might be scared
of who I used to be.

313
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,366
And who is that?

314
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,869
Somebody different?

315
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,707
So when did you change?
When you went into the Army?

316
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,711
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, partly yeah.

317
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,170
And the other part?

318
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,257
I don't know,
I'm still working on that.

319
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,469
So you used to be tough.

320
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,849
And maybe you still are a little bit.

321
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,893
- You don't scare me, John.
- No?

322
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,897
Well, you scare me.

323
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,318
Don't worry about him.

324
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,747
John!

325
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,510
What, you think you're safe
in there? Okay.

326
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,892
No!

327
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,712
It's all right.
Everybody understands.

328
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,618
What are you doing over here?

329
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,120
You're missing the party.

330
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,290
The party's just managing fine
without me.

331
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,334
What's wrong?

332
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,088
Why are you all the way
over here by yourself?

333
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,799
I'm dying, John.

334
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,467
What?

335
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,803
That's not even funny.

336
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm gonna miss you.

337
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,186
It's almost over.

338
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,813
No, it's not almost over.

339
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,273
Yes, it is.

340
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,402
I leave tomorrow.
I have to go back to school.

341
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,653
- So?
- And you.

342
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,323
No, and me nothing.
My commitment's up in 12 months.

343
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,034
And then I'm back. For good.

344
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,996
A lot could happen
in 12 months, John.

345
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,331
You don't think I know that?

346
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,959
I know that.

347
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,920
And I'm not afraid at all.

348
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,427
I promise you...

349
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,346
...that it'll all be over
sooner than you think.

350
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,641
Then I'll be back for good.

351
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,228
You promise?

352
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,774
I promise.

353
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,341
I'm probably gonna be out of the Army
way before you're out of school.

354
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,345
Am I gonna be in the audience
when you graduate?

355
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,389
I think I might take
a little longer to graduate.

356
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,727
Been spending so much time
around your dad...

357
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,898
...and I think now
I want to teach special education.

358
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,651
- You don't say.
- I don't know why it's taken me...

359
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:38,906
...so long to realize. I mean,
I've lived next to Alan my whole life..

360
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,868
I'm sorry, back up. What does
that have to do with my dad?

361
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,707
Well, there's....

362
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,712
I mean, there's an explanation
for why he is the way he is.

363
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,591
Forget it. Never mind.

364
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,802
- No, no, no.
- No, let's go. Come here.

365
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,763
What?
So, just, what were you saying?

366
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,687
I grew up next to a kid with autism.

367
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,439
- I have a frame of reference.
- Whoa, autistic?

368
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,276
You saying my dad's like Alan?
You're saying my dad's retarded?

369
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,780
No, Alan's not retarded, John.
He's autistic.

370
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,783
There are milder forms of it
and these things go undiagnosed.

371
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,495
Is this what you've been doing?
You've just been studying my dad?

372
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,622
No. How could you even say that?

373
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,084
I've lived with my dad my entire life.
Put up with him my entire life.

374
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,545
You think I don't know
that he's not normal?

375
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,296
Yeah?

376
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,341
You think I need you to tell me
he's not normal?

377
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,554
Yeah.

378
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,687
Hey, soldier, leaving so soon, huh?

379
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,107
Here, have a beer. It's on me.

380
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,818
Come on, you should drink.
It'll make you feel better.

381
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,987
- Now's not a good time, all right?
- You sad?

382
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,449
No, come on. You just need to relax.
Come on. Just relax a little bit.

383
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,325
What's going on with Savannah?

384
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,494
- Just leave me alone.
- What's with Savannah?

385
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,997
- How about you get your hands off?
- Come on.

386
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,249
What is happening
with you and Savannah--?

387
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,834
Hey, man, what are you doing?

388
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,669
John!

389
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,921
Oh, my.. Oh, my God!

390
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,675
- John!
- Stop him. What is he doing?

391
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,182
- Help him!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

392
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,585
I don't think she's home now.

393
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,338
But she hasn't
gone back to school yet.

394
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:06,053
She normally comes by and says
goodbye before she heads back, but....

395
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,476
Oh, shit, Tim.

396
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,353
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

397
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,523
Hey, I like it.

398
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,566
I think it makes me look
pretty tough.

399
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,320
I just.. I had no idea
it was you back there.

400
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,531
Hey, it was my fault.

401
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,159
I don't know what I was thinking,
sneaking up behind a green beret.

402
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,328
Hey, if you see her...

403
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,706
...can you give her a message
for me?

404
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,333
Yeah.

405
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,462
Just tell her I came by...

406
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,923
...and that I....

407
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,424
You wanna write it down?

408
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,595
Yeah.

409
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,017
I'll make sure she gets it.

410
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,602
Thank you.

411
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,907
Hey, Pop.

412
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,244
I didn't know if anyone
else was coming so...

413
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,455
...I made double.

414
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,435
No, I'll do it.

415
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,021
- I got it, Dad. Lt's okay. I got it.
- No, I'll do it.

416
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,315
- They're clean.
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

417
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,693
Okay.

418
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,175
Looks like you're gonna have
leftovers for once.

419
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,346
Oh, I'll have it next Sunday.

420
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,323
Excuse me, Pop.

421
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,374
Got your note.

422
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,877
- Short, sweet, to the point.
- I'm sorry.

423
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,504
John, I'm sorry.

424
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,799
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

425
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,717
I didn't mean to make you feel that.

426
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,388
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
No business pretending I'm a doctor.

427
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,723
- I was watching him today.
- John.

428
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,601
Please, I'm serious. I don't know
what I'm talking about.

429
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,687
I really don't. It means nothing.

430
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,271
Okay?

431
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,733
I'm headed back to school.

432
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,736
And I just wanted
to make sure that, you know....

433
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,697
Make sure that what?

434
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,283
I made you a promise, didn't I?

435
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,411
Yeah.

436
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:24,376
You wrote your first note
so I wrote mine.

437
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,296
Don't read it now. Wait till I'm gone.

438
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,798
Okay.

439
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,761
- Hey, can you..? You hungry?
- Yes.

440
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,932
Yeah? My dad made
a little extra for you.

441
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,976
You know, it's Sunday.

442
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,394
Okay.

443
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,521
- I can only stay a little while.
- I know.

444
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,939
Come on.

445
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,279
<i>Dear John...</i>

446
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,574
<i>...two weeks together...</i>

447
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,784
<i>...that's all it took.</i>

448
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,707
<i>Two weeks for me</i>
<i>to fall in love with you.</i>

449
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,347
<i>Now we have one year apart.</i>

450
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,269
<i>But what's one year apart</i>
<i>after two weeks like that together?</i>

451
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,490
- All right, Pop.
- Okay.

452
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,658
I gotta go.

453
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,161
- You be good, okay?
- Okay.

454
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,829
So....

455
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,333
- We're good. All right. See you later.
- Okay.

456
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,261
<i>You made me a promise.</i>

457
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,472
<i>A promise I know you'll keep.</i>

458
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:05,519
<i>So I only want one more promise from</i>
<i>you during this time we spend apart.</i>

459
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,230
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

460
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,192
<i>Write it all down, John.</i>
<i>Scribble it in a notebook.</i>

461
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,820
<i>Type it out, e-mail it to me...</i>

462
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,406
<i>...I don't care,</i>
<i>but I wanna know everything.</i>

463
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:25,205
<i>Then we'll be with each other all the</i>
<i>time even if we're not with each other.</i>

464
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,544
<i>That way before we know it,</i>
<i>I'll see you soon, then.</i>

465
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,889
- What's up, girls?
- Johnny!

466
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,224
What up, man?

467
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,976
- Hey, there he is.
- Look who it is.

468
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,520
- Welcome back, John.
- Look at you.

469
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,564
Welcome back.
Take a look at your voucher.

470
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,315
All right.

471
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,318
How was Atlantic City, man?

472
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,408
No, laugh it up. That's great.
Yeah. That's the one thing I ask him.

473
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,493
I didn't say.
First time I've seen him.

474
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,163
- Wouldn't ask if you didn't know.
- How could he know?

475
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,373
Don't even bother unpacking, guys.

476
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:12,210
We move out bright and early.
Enjoy.

477
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,589
Well, I'm excited.

478
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,267
<i>Dear Savannah, L promise.</i>
<i>I promise I'll see you soon, then.</i>

479
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,437
<i>I promise I'll write all the time.</i>

480
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,939
<i>I promise I'll tell you everything.</i>

481
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:40,322
<i>Be patient with me, it may take a while</i>
<i>for these Letters to get back to you.</i>

482
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,242
<i>We've already been deployed</i>
<i>out on a mission.</i>

483
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,539
Come on, soldier, move it, move it.
Let's go!

484
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:57,047
<i>The problem is we can't exactly</i>
<i>use the local postal system here.</i>

485
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,716
<i>And there's no such thing</i>
<i>as Internet connection.</i>

486
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,469
<i>So I have to send everything</i>
<i>from here out by airmail.</i>

487
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,597
- Can you get this out for me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,308
- Don't lose it, all right?
- Yeah, I gotcha.

489
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,398
<i>Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to say</i>
<i>exactly where here is.</i>

490
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,318
<i>All I can tell you is</i>
<i>where we've been sent...</i>

491
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,654
<i>...makes me miss America</i>
<i>very much.</i>

492
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,784
<i>And the lack of anything resembling</i>
<i>an ocean makes me miss Charleston.</i>

493
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,358
<i>And everything around me</i>
<i>makes me miss you.</i>

494
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,698
<i>We move around a Lot. so letters</i>
<i>tend to come late and out of order.</i>

495
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,783
<i>We may want to number</i>
<i>our letters...</i>

496
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,452
<i>...just so we know which order</i>
<i>we wrote them in.</i>

497
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,872
<i>But when they do finally get here...</i>

498
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,541
<i>...it's a good day.</i>

499
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,546
<i>- Whenever they don't...</i>
- All right, let's see here.

500
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,300
Not for me. Not for me.

501
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,304
Not for me. And not for me.

502
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,555
Figures.

503
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,682
<i>- ...it's not.</i>
- Nothing for you either.

504
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:35,145
<i>But I know they'll still come.</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

505
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,404
That's right.

506
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,076
<i>Letter Number 8.</i>

507
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,372
<i>Dear John, I'm back at my</i>
<i>parents' farm for the weekend.</i>

508
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,083
<i>And they have some house guests</i>
<i>you may know.</i>

509
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:05,925
Savannah!

510
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,262
I think that horse suits you just fine.

511
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,309
<i>I took Alan out riding with me today.</i>
<i>It was his first time on a horse.</i>

512
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,145
You look good on that horse, Alan.

513
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,940
<i>You've heard of horse sense, horses</i>
<i>are somehow able to sense danger?</i>

514
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,234
<i>Sense out evil?</i>

515
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,863
<i>Well, I think autistic kids</i>
<i>have that too...</i>

516
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,115
<i>...so I had this idea.</i>

517
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,034
<i>This dream.</i>

518
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,954
<i>I wanna open up</i>
<i>a summer camp for autistic kids.</i>

519
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,082
I've never seen him
act like this before.

520
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,085
Are you hungry?

521
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,296
<i>Where they can ride horses</i>
<i>as much as they want.</i>

522
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,548
Are you hungry?

523
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,428
<i>For once in their life, a place where</i>
<i>they won't have to worry about a thing.</i>

524
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,140
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>Pipe dream, huh?</i>

525
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,226
<i>No, it's not a pipe dream.</i>

526
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,561
<i>It's a perfect dream.</i>

527
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,942
Erget. Merry Christmas.

528
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,237
John, to a Mr. John Tyree.

529
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,488
- Shut up, man.
- Seven?

530
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,157
- Stop moving around.
- Can I keep this one?

531
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,576
<i>Letter Number 33.</i>

532
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,997
<i>Dear Savannah, the good news is</i>
<i>we've been sent somewhere new.</i>

533
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,917
<i>Although I can't tell you</i>
<i>where that is either.</i>

534
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,547
<i>The bad news is, this place actually</i>
<i>makes me miss the old place.</i>

535
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,633
<i>But it's a full moon here tonight,</i>
<i>which makes me think of you.</i>

536
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:33,012
<i>Because I know that no matter what</i>
<i>I'm doing, no matter where I am...</i>

537
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,266
<i>...this moon will always be</i>
<i>the same size as yours.</i>

538
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,017
<i>Half a world away.</i>

539
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,645
<i>Dear John...</i>

540
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,940
<i>...most nights I fall asleep</i>
<i>worrying about you.</i>

541
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,401
<i>Wondering where</i>
<i>you may be out there.</i>

542
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,530
<i>Not tonight.</i>

543
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,740
<i>Tonight you're here with me.</i>

544
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,330
<i>I visited your dad yesterday.</i>

545
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,544
<i>Summer's almost over and I wanted to</i>
<i>see him before I went back to school.</i>

546
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,795
<i>I hope that's okay.</i>

547
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,172
Hey.

548
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,673
I made you a pie.

549
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,886
<i>He made me dinner.</i>
<i>It was Sunday so we had lasagna.</i>

550
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:17,640
<i>And I got him talking about his coins.</i>
<i>So we had plenty of conversation.</i>

551
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,936
This one is kind of a cull,
a coin that's in really bad shape.

552
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,315
- Worthless to most collectors.
- But not to you.

553
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,442
No, not to me.

554
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,402
What is your favorite coin?

555
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:34,866
Out of all the coins that you have,
what is your absolute favorite coin?

556
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,826
Do you have one?

557
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,297
'Seventy-eight Jefferson mule.

558
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,217
That'd be my favorite.

559
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,594
Definitely.

560
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,348
Why? Is it worth the most?

561
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,476
Well, it's worth a lot, not the most.

562
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,561
But, you know....

563
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,897
What's the story behind it?

564
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,112
Here's one....

565
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,075
<i>So I'll ask you instead, John,</i>
<i>wherever you may be.</i>

566
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:27,585
<i>Dear Savannah, only because</i>
<i>I promised to tell you everything.</i>

567
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,630
Thank you.

568
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:34,300
<i>When I was 7 years old,</i>
<i>I bought an ice cream cone.</i>

569
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:40,056
<i>On the way home, I noticed one of</i>
<i>the pennies wasn't actually a penny.</i>

570
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,862
I don't know.

571
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,326
I don't know.
Never seen anything like it.

572
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,329
Did you find this, son?

573
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,665
Yeah?

574
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,126
No, it's a mule.

575
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,880
- It's a what?
- A mule. An error coin.

576
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,882
Every now and then
they make mistakes...

577
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,760
...batch accidentally slips through,
this thing...

578
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:22,724
...head's a nickel, tail's a penny. Mule.
Really more of a novelty than anything.

579
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,393
<i>Remember the horse sense</i>
<i>you were talking about?</i>

580
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,604
..the kid found it
I will buy it anyway.

581
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,397
Twenty bucks.

582
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,611
- No, thank you.
<i>- Well, my dad has it too.</i>

583
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,946
Now, wait a minute. Hang on.

584
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,324
Let me take another look
at that real quick.

585
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,287
John, let's go.

586
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,039
I'll be damned.

587
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,375
- Do you know what this is?
- No.

588
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,719
Look at that.

589
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,220
That's your coin.

590
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,889
You want my advice?

591
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,724
Dad to Dad?

592
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,225
Keep it.

593
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,145
Hold on to it.
Pass it down to your son.

594
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,231
Let him pass it to his son
and on and on, I'll tell you what...

595
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:16,277
...30, 40, a hundred years
from now...

596
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:20,073
...you're gonna have something
worth a whole lot more than $4000.

597
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,991
I promise you.

598
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,078
Hey.

599
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,829
Do you want to keep it?

600
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,834
- Good for you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

601
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,922
<i>At first I Loved chasing after</i>
<i>those mules with my father.</i>

602
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,424
<i>We finally had something</i>
<i>to talk about.</i>

603
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,010
<i>You know, something</i>
<i>we could do together.</i>

604
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,223
<i>But he became obsessed with them.</i>
<i>You know how he is.</i>

605
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,268
<i>And then I became a teenager</i>
<i>and you know how I am.</i>

606
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,522
All the way up to Wooster
for another coin show. I'm just..

607
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,732
No, I'm not doing that.

608
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,360
You're going to one
every weekend now.

609
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:02,198
Oh, that's good.
I love warm milk. That's nice.

610
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,369
You spend all of our money on coins.
Get a fricking fridge that works.

611
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,880
<i>Eventually he stopped talking</i>
<i>about coins with me altogether.</i>

612
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,466
<i>And when that happened...</i>

613
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,053
<i>...we found there wasn't all that much</i>
<i>left to talk about.</i>

614
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,353
<i>So that's the story.</i>

615
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,773
<i>I miss you so much it hurts.</i>

616
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,944
Sorry, sorry.

617
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,614
Oh, my God.
My brother was in the towers.

618
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:47,326
- I love you too, babe.
- Please call me as soon as you can.

619
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,252
- Susan. Susan, is my dad there?
- Just calm down.

620
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,373
All right, fellas, here's the deal.

621
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,834
Requesting permission
to extend my tour, sir.

622
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,878
Requesting permission
to extend, sir.

623
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,297
Requesting permission
to extend as well, sir.

624
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,174
Requesting permission
to extend, sir.

625
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,635
Requesting permission
to extend as well, sir.

626
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,722
Okay, guys, listen. We're gonna get
our orders from Operations on Monday.

627
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,726
Before we do anything rash, let's take
the weekend to mull this over, all right?

628
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,728
I got a wife and kids to think about.

629
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,773
Nobody's asking you
to stay on too, captain.

630
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,025
Yeah, you are. This is my team.

631
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,652
Where you go, I go.

632
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,196
Where we go, we all go.

633
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,741
If everyone still wants to extend
on Monday, then we'll do it.

634
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,243
Together.

635
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,832
Don't get into trouble over there.

636
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,917
- Take care of yourself.
- Always.

637
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,670
Let's go, man.
The plane to Paris leaves in an hour.

638
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,421
You ready? Are you ready?

639
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,298
- It's gonna be amazing.
- I can't go.

640
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,842
What? Of course you're going.

641
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,260
I gotta go to Charleston.

642
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,220
- You're going to Charleston?
- Yup.

643
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,597
What are you, nuts?
We got two days off, man.

644
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,934
By the time you fly there and back,
you're gonna have like 18 hours.

645
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,353
It's 18 more than I had this morning.

646
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,398
I don't know when
I'll get that again...

647
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,149
...so I gotta go.

648
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,068
Nothing I can say
to change your mind?

649
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,278
Nope.

650
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,205
John!

651
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,793
John. John.

652
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,666
You sure he--? He actually said that?
He wants to come?

653
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,003
I think he will.

654
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,506
- He wasn't so sure about it, but....
- Yeah, I'll bet he wasn't.

655
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,217
<i>..has asked President Bush</i>
<i>to activate...</i>

656
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,387
<i>...thousands of military reservists.</i>

657
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,850
Hey, Pop!

658
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,396
Hey, what are you doing in here?

659
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,857
Look at you.

660
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,317
Spiffy.

661
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,027
Are you coming with us?

662
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:12,657
Please. My parents are so excited
to meet you, Mr. Tyree.

663
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,241
Yeah.

664
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,536
You hungry?

665
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,373
I made meatloaf.

666
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,501
I know you made meatloaf, Pop.
It's Saturday.

667
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,294
We can take it with us.

668
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,047
We can take it with us.
You mind if we take it with us?

669
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,216
Well, I don't....

670
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,511
Is that okay? I'll wrap it up.

671
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,276
I don't mean.. I'm sorry, but could..?

672
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,821
Could you stop the car,
because I need to go back.

673
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,074
- Should I turn around?
- Stop the car, please. Stop the car.

674
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,325
- Forget something?
- Okay.

675
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,661
No, I need to get out
of the car. Please.

676
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,330
- All right, just.. Just relax, okay?
- Yeah.

677
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,332
I don't think I can do this.

678
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,254
- Look, you're fine. You're fine.
- No, I just.. Please. I need to get out.

679
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,297
You're okay, Pop. It's fine.

680
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:13,175
- Look, stop the car, I can't..
- Okay, I'll turn around.

681
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,011
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

682
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,014
- I gotta get out. Stop the car.
- Okay, all right.

683
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,642
- Come on, Dad, stop!
- Okay.

684
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,353
Pop. Come on, don't do that.

685
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,447
Hey, Mr. Tyree.

686
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,407
Hey, you all right?

687
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,825
- You okay?
- I'm sorry.

688
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,618
It's okay.

689
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,288
But hey, let's....

690
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,625
We're gonna wait for you
in the car, all right?

691
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,803
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- No, don't, honestly,

692
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,097
We can stay. Let's just stay.

693
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,392
Okay? Let's stay,
because I can go next year.

694
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,730
Pop, I only got one night.

695
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,318
I mean, I gotta go back.
Do you understand that?

696
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,820
You should go. You both should go.

697
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,833
<i>New York Mayor RudoIph Giuliani said</i>
<i>Wall street will re-open on Monday.</i>

698
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,420
He tried. At least he tried.

699
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:45,267
Hello, welcome.

700
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,270
My girl.

701
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,690
Mom, this is John.

702
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:56,695
John, I feel like I already know you.
Where's your father, did he come too?

703
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,697
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, that's okay.

704
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,201
I'm just glad
that you made it home safe.

705
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,204
We thought about canceling
with everything that's going on...

706
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,873
...but we felt like
everybody should be together.

707
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,751
I've been briefing him in the car
and I think he's good.

708
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:15,464
It was good Intel. With solid tactical
training, I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

709
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,716
I love him already.

710
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,176
Mrs. Curtis, Savannah.

711
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,262
- Hey, dude, how's it going?
- John.

712
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,888
It's good to see you again.

713
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,894
All right, You know what?
You look like you could use a drink.

714
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,565
- I'll grab one for you.
- Yes, thank you.

715
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,400
- John.
- What's he doing here?

716
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:38,529
He's here because I invited him.
His family lives just up the street.

717
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,739
What are you, like,
hanging out now?

718
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,869
He's really not that bad once you get
to know him, I swear to you, John.

719
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,372
Here you go.

720
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,167
It's bourbon, it's not gonna kill you.

721
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,668
Be right back.

722
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,050
We got off on the wrong foot and I want
to apologize for the way I treated you.

723
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:04,346
If I had known that Savannah
was actually gonna stay with you...

724
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:09,351
...I wouldn't have treated you that way.
In all seriousness, I'm sorry.

725
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,188
Fair enough.

726
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,440
If you need anything and....

727
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,610
- Enjoy yourself.
- Right.

728
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,196
So this is him.

729
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,990
Yup. No tough-guy routine
from you, Dad.

730
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,076
Routine?
I bench press refrigerators, honey.

731
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,329
Your boyfriends
need to know these things.

732
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,207
He's absolutely right.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Curtis.

733
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,501
But l think Tim here might have
already beat you to the punch.

734
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,795
He said he'd rough me up
if ever I hurt her.

735
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,798
I was very convincing too.
I think I made quite an impact.

736
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,468
Well, cheers, son.
Glad you could join us.

737
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,802
Thank you, sir.

738
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,015
- Billy! You actually showed up!
- See, hard part's over.

739
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,770
- Good to see you again, John.
- How you doing, Tim?

740
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,481
Hi. Hey, Tim, how are you doing?

741
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,317
- Good.
- I haven't seen your wife. Is she here?

742
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,320
Yeah, she's on vacation actually.

743
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,031
- So I'll tell her you said hello.
- Please do.

744
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,699
I will.

745
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,329
Alan, remember
what we talked about?

746
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,832
Another vacation?

747
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,126
Yeah.

748
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,547
Alan ever ask about her?

749
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,344
Yeah, he does.
I just don't know what to say.

750
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,515
Hey, look, I'm not a father.

751
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,353
You know, I'm really in no position
to give you advice at all.

752
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,107
When I was a kid,
I waited around every day...

753
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,484
...hoping that today
would finally be the day...

754
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,486
...that my mom would come home.

755
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,782
I waited around 15 years.

756
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,661
So I know how painful
it might have been for my dad to...

757
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,038
...just tell me the truth.

758
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,126
It would have saved me
a lot of waiting around.

759
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,836
You know?

760
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,883
Well, I guess if the worst thing
you can say about your father...

761
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,262
...is he tried to protect you
too much then...

762
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,807
...that's a pretty good father, isn't it?

763
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,894
I'm sorry.
You're John, right? Savannah's John?

764
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,522
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna thank you for what you do.

765
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,317
Know our prayers are with you.
I hope whatever happens...

766
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,570
...it'll be over soon. So you boys
can come home safe and sound.

767
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,989
Oh, it won't be over anytime soon.

768
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,992
Afghanistan will just be the first stop
of many.

769
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,079
He's right, you know. Pretty soon they'll
ask y'all to reenlist for another tour.

770
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,082
Slowly but surely they'll
stop asking and start telling.

771
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,501
None of the soldiers I know
need to be asked, sir.

772
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,129
And we sure don't need to be told.

773
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,089
What do you mean by we?

774
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,143
It was great to see you guys.
See you next year.

775
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,728
Savannah....

776
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,945
So you're gonna reenlist,
just like that?

777
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,784
It's something we should talk about.

778
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,787
Two more years, John.

779
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,380
Have you already done it?
Have you already re-upped?

780
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,508
No.

781
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,302
But you decided
that you're going to?

782
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,766
Do I have a say?

783
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,601
Do I have a say in this?

784
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,814
- You don't understand.
- Don't ever tell me I don't understand.

785
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,629
Leave me alone, John.

786
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,844
Please.

787
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,639
What do you...?

788
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,809
What do you want from me?

789
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,186
Savannah, I mean....

790
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,775
Just tell me what you want from me.
I mean, you want me to quit?

791
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,527
Is that it?

792
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,990
Look, I don't know how we got here.
I don't know what happened.

793
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,326
Just woke up and...

794
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,912
...there's buildings falling and....

795
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,666
I mean, I had a plan..
I had a plan, but now I don't.

796
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,544
And I have no idea what to do.

797
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,548
I don't know what to do and l just--
All I know is I wanna stay here.

798
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,968
I just wanna stay right here with you
as long as I possibly can.

799
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,388
You're just all that matters, okay?
You're all that matters to me.

800
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,683
I'm trying to figure out what
the right thing is and I don't know.

801
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:03,979
I don't have any idea how to get there.
I just-- Because I need you to tell me.

802
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,815
I just need you to tell me, okay?

803
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,903
Can you just tell me, please--?
Just tell me what you want me to do.

804
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,706
I want you to come with me.

805
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,774
Hey, Pop.

806
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,949
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

807
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,576
Well....

808
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,585
So you think you're gonna be
okay by yourself this time?

809
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,754
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

810
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,305
I should probably be getting going.

811
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,767
Take care of yourself.

812
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,002
So are we...?
I mean, we're okay though.

813
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,255
Right? Nothing has changed?

814
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,059
Be careful not to step
in any fires, okay?

815
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,980
Okay. I will.

816
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,942
So I'll see you soon, then.

817
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,486
I'll see you soon, then.

818
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,189
<i>Welcome back, guys.</i>

819
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,108
Hope you had a good weekend.
Wish it could've been longer...

820
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,944
...but sometimes you got
to take what you can get.

821
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,615
So that's it then?

822
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,334
It's unanimous?

823
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,171
Okay.

824
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,590
I'll start the paperwork.

825
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,645
Thank you, sir.

826
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,897
O'Neill, here you go!

827
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,776
This smells pretty good, Russ.

828
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,945
And we got Daniels. Where's he at?

829
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:54,973
Move, move, move, up and shoot!

830
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,604
- Hey, yo.
- Yeah, nothing today, man. Sorry.

831
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,234
Go, go, go.

832
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,074
Yo, you guys seen John?
Is he back here?

833
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,661
Yo, John.

834
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,747
Got one for you, dude.

835
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,875
- Yeah?
- That's it, though.

836
01:06:55,803 --> 01:07:01,766
<i>Dear John, I know it's been</i>
<i>way too long since I last wrote you.</i>

837
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:06,604
<i>I've been staring at this blank page</i>
<i>for the last two hours.</i>

838
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:09,149
<i>Well, if I'm being honest...</i>

839
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,736
<i>...I've been staring at it</i>
<i>for the last two months.</i>

840
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:18,033
<i>Please forgive me</i>
<i>for what I'm about to say.</i>

841
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,330
<i>And know that this is</i>
<i>the hardest thing I've ever had to do.</i>

842
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,293
<i>My life without you has no meaning.</i>

843
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:32,422
<i>And I cannot Live.... I'm sorry.</i>

844
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:39,054
Yo, listen to this, hedge fund manager
on Wall Street, right?

845
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,973
How much do you think he made
at his regular job?

846
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:49,397
Twenty-seven million dollars, he ran
a hedge fund. Works on Wall Street.

847
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,274
That is amazing.

848
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,007
You making mud pies, buddy?

849
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,601
What's going on, man?

850
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,194
You wanna talk about it?

851
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,363
Nothing to talk about.

852
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,702
She found somebody else.

853
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,543
You got any idea who it is?

854
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,171
No, she didn't say.

855
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:58,341
I mean, I got a pretty good idea.

856
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,887
Look, man...

857
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:06,558
...you know, this happens, dude.
I mean, you'll get her back.

858
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:08,393
You get home, she comes running.

859
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,062
- It's the whole cycle, dude.
- They already got engaged.

860
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,859
Jesus.

861
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,070
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

862
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,574
Let me know if I can do anything,
all right?

863
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:42,093
..off the bottom rim. You wouldn't think
a squirrel could swim, but I swear...

864
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,971
...swam 20 yards to the shoreline.

865
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,265
- Swimming squirrel.
- That's crazy, dude.

866
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,018
Hey, notice that. Did y'all see that?

867
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,770
I mean, that's as sexy as it gets
around here.

868
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:56,274
They can't show their legs,
so they got fishnets on their faces.

869
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,320
I'm gonna bring that back to the States
and make my girl wear that.

870
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,614
How mysterious.

871
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,710
Back up, back up!

872
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,046
- What's he saying?
- Hey, he's speaking Turkish.

873
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,798
- What is he saying, though?
- I don't know. I don't know.

874
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,800
Come on, specialist, figure it out!

875
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:26,638
Look, man, I speak Pashtu,
I speak Farsi, I speak all kinds of shit.

876
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,514
What languages you speak?
Come here.

877
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,808
- Good work, man.
- Stay right there.

878
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:34,646
- Hey, where are you going?
- Somebody's gotta figure it out.

879
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:36,314
- Noodles, go with him.
- Yeah.

880
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,607
Back up, back up.

881
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,401
<i>Tyree!</i>

882
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,780
<i>Wait for further instructions.</i>

883
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,406
Let's move out.

884
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,668
- Good?
- Yeah, you?

885
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,261
We got a man down! Noodles, you
gonna be all right, man! Hold on, man!

886
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,930
Copy that, man down! Man down!

887
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,101
- Come here.
- You see it?

888
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,852
I got you. Get your hands up!

889
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,021
<i>Tyree, do you read?</i>
<i>Talk to me, Tyree.</i>

890
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,690
Lucky SOB. It hit your plate.

891
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:23,361
Jesus, l never loved a piece of clothing
more in my entire life, I swear to God.

892
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,702
John!

893
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,706
Man down! Medic!

894
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,874
Medic! John.

895
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,251
Come on, man.

896
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,877
Medic!

897
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,464
Look, come on, you're gonna
be fine, all right? It's nothing.

898
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,508
It's nothing. You got this.

899
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:50,596
Stay awake, okay? You just look
in my eyes, just look in my eyes!

900
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,809
Keep your eyes open, okay?

901
01:11:56,312 --> 01:12:00,064
Eyes, awake, awake,
right at me, okay?

902
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:04,736
Jakes!

903
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,172
Welcome back, Sergeant Tyree.

904
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,383
Rest easy, okay?
You're in the hospital in Germany.

905
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,469
And you're gonna be just fine.

906
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,325
Tyree.

907
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,328
- You look good, man.
- Thank you, sir.

908
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:41,582
I just wanted to come by
and let you know I'll be extending.

909
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,669
Extending.
Tyree, it's been three months.

910
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,796
I'm impressed, but I'm not stupid.

911
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,799
Go home, John. Get some R&R.

912
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,218
Keep your dad some company
for a while.

913
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,639
Have a seat.

914
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:03,479
Listen, I'm being transferred.

915
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,940
Now, this has nothing to do
with what happened.

916
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,025
My captain duties are done here.

917
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:13,197
Going back to Fort Bragg.
I actually miss my family.

918
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,408
That's good, sir.

919
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:19,537
Berry and Daniels are getting out, the
others, coming down on assignment.

920
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,832
- And you've got less than four months..
- I'm definitely extending.

921
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:28,045
Your war is over, John.
You served your country well.

922
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:31,591
You know what?
I might just make this a career.

923
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,303
No talking you out of this, huh?

924
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,917
Mark, on my mark!

925
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,087
Mark!

926
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,266
Where you thinking next?

927
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,354
Oh, man. I don't know,
wherever they send us.

928
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,775
Actually, we're sending you home
to the States, John.

929
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,695
I'm sorry, we just got the news.

930
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,968
He's conscious, but he's not lucid.

931
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,512
And he's hardly ever responsive.

932
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,765
It's hard for me to say
how severe the stroke really is...

933
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:06,269
...because we don't know how long
he was down before they found him.

934
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:11,315
If I'd have been there
to find him like that earlier...

935
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,610
...do you think it would've
made a difference?

936
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,905
I doubt it. I really doubt it.

937
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,813
- Hey, Jeff, here's that scan.
- No problem.

938
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,995
Hey, Pop.

939
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:52,166
What--? What the heck do you--?
Ma'am, why do you have him out here?

940
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,420
You okay? How you feeling?

941
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:04,053
I....

942
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:12,395
I mean, it's nothing, but I wrote you--
I wrote you a letter.

943
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:20,611
No, no, don't read it now.
You don't have to--

944
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,864
I didn't think you'd-- Why don't you
read it when I'm not around?

945
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:37,336
You know what? The hell with it.
I'll just read it to you.

946
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,137
"Dear Dad.

947
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,807
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

948
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,352
You remember a few years back...

949
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:56,188
...when I got shot.

950
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,401
Well, you wanna know
the very first thing...

951
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,112
...that entered my mind
at that moment?

952
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,281
Right before I blacked out?

953
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,745
Coins.

954
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,499
Suddenly I was 8 years old again.

955
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:17,835
I was on that tour of the U.S. Mint.

956
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:21,088
I was listening to the guide explain
how coins are made.

957
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:25,176
How they're punched out of sheet metal
and how they're rimmed and beveled.

958
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,636
How they're stamped and cleaned.

959
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:31,182
And how each and every batch
of coins are personally examined...

960
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:36,270
...in case any have slipped through
with the slightest imperfection.

961
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,148
Do you remember that, Dad?

962
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:42,359
I mean, do you remember that trip
to Philadelphia we took?

963
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,949
That's what popped into my head.

964
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:56,332
I'm a coin of the United States Army.

965
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,461
And I was minted in the year 1980.

966
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,256
I've been punched from sheet metal.

967
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:06,967
I've been stamped and cleaned.

968
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:11,847
And my edges have been
rimmed and beveled.

969
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,812
But now I have
two small holes in me.

970
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,398
So I'm no longer
in perfect condition."

971
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:28,739
How about it, Dad? You know,
we're just a couple of culls here, huh?

972
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,373
"But there's one--
There's one more thing...

973
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,292
...that l want to tell you too.

974
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:48,342
After l got shot, you know,
right before I blacked out.

975
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,727
You wanna know the very last thing
I thought of?"

976
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:02,815
I'm sorry.

977
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:14,618
The very last thing I thought of....

978
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:17,955
You wanna know the very last thing
I thought of?

979
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:00,599
I'm so sorry,
I don't want to rush you...

980
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,726
...but we have another service
coming in.

981
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:39,323
John.

982
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:54,671
What brings you home?

983
01:24:57,717 --> 01:24:58,926
It's my dad.

984
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,097
How's your dad?

985
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,517
He....

986
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:18,362
I'm sorry.

987
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,698
I wish I had known.

988
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,078
It's okay.

989
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,790
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

990
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,625
I'm so sorry.

991
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,711
He's-- He was a really good man.

992
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:47,683
You finally did it, huh?

993
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,229
Camp Horse Sense.

994
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,897
No.

995
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,984
I didn't. I tried.

996
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:02,364
It only lasted one summer after we
took over this place from my parents.

997
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:06,243
It was.... It was expensive.

998
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,552
Do you want to come inside?

999
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,221
It's just me.

1000
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,977
When do you have to go back?

1001
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,607
As soon as I get my dad's stuff
squared away.

1002
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,114
Have you settled down yet?

1003
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,657
No.

1004
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:49,536
But you must be dating a lot, huh?

1005
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:53,957
No. I don't think you can call it
dating exactly.

1006
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,712
It's so good to see you.

1007
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,881
Here. Alive.

1008
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,763
Hold on. I'm just gonna-- I'm sorry.

1009
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,476
Hello?

1010
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,311
Hey.

1011
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:16,730
No, I'm fine.

1012
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,280
I....

1013
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:29,201
Well, John-- John is here.

1014
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:33,830
Yeah, John Tyree.

1015
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:38,210
Yeah, I'm gonna leave soon.

1016
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:40,796
Okay, I'll see you.

1017
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,215
I'll be there in like
20 minutes, okay?

1018
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:46,343
I love you too. Bye.

1019
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:53,600
He wants to see you.

1020
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:55,852
Wait, what?

1021
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,358
It's Tim?

1022
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:11,702
Initially after he was diagnosed,
he was so optimistic.

1023
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,746
He wasn't concerned,
all he cared about was Alan...

1024
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:16,873
...which was inspiring.

1025
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:21,545
It wasn't until after the cancer spread to
stage four that I noticed a big change.

1026
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:25,007
What kind of cancer is it?

1027
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,634
Lymphoma.

1028
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,930
He's had it with being cooped up
in that room...

1029
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,558
...so he basically just spends
all his time out here.

1030
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,977
Sometimes with Alan.

1031
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:46,987
- Can I have a crumble cake?
- Alan, do you remember John?

1032
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,739
Hello, John.

1033
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:50,240
Hey, Alan.

1034
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:51,992
He's gotten big.

1035
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,579
- How are you?
- Good.

1036
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,208
I'm gonna get him a crumble cake.

1037
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:03,045
Oh, that's a good idea.
He's been talking about that.

1038
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:04,713
Come on, Alan.

1039
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:12,929
I guess you must want to
kick my ass, huh?

1040
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,308
There's not a lot I can
do about it here, is there?

1041
01:29:20,396 --> 01:29:22,272
It's all part of my master plan.

1042
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:25,609
Hell of a plan.

1043
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,697
I love her.

1044
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:38,288
Everything that happened
in my life before, it's gone now.

1045
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,582
It's been wiped clean.

1046
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:43,960
I wanted to tell you that.

1047
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:47,798
And I'm sorry.

1048
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:53,345
I'm sorry for how it happened
with you so far away.

1049
01:29:54,722 --> 01:30:00,310
But l know now that Alan will always
have someone to take care of him.

1050
01:30:02,146 --> 01:30:05,482
He will always be in good hands.

1051
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,252
She still loves you, you know.

1052
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:27,170
Why is it black?

1053
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:30,257
It's plain as day, you can see it
all over her face.

1054
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,429
I wish that weren't the case...

1055
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:39,850
...but she's never looked at me
the way she used to look at you.

1056
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,896
You should know that.

1057
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,993
Be careful, Alan.

1058
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:03,707
He still loves those horses, huh?

1059
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,293
Yeah, he'll be out there till bedtime.

1060
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,380
I gotta get him out of that hospital.

1061
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,217
He needs to come home.

1062
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:20,015
There's a company in Texas
with an experimental drug.

1063
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,726
That might help.

1064
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,898
But the insurance companies
don't pay for it, of course.

1065
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,944
My parents sold their beach house
a year ago.

1066
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:35,322
Which was a godsend.

1067
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,576
We've done a few fund raisers.

1068
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:45,916
But l never would have guessed
that we would run out so fast.

1069
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,675
Stay for dinner, okay?

1070
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,267
So you drink now.

1071
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:06,645
Just a glass or two at dinner.

1072
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:10,315
Tim got me started
a couple years ago.

1073
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,367
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1074
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,576
What do you mean?

1075
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,037
How am I looking at you?

1076
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:26,957
Differently.

1077
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:30,961
I don't know, how do you
want me to look at you?

1078
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,296
You're different.

1079
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,475
I don't know--

1080
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:52,148
I don't know why I came here.
I mean, what are we doing?

1081
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:58,613
We're sitting here
and we're eating and we're talking...

1082
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,949
...but no one's
actually saying anything.

1083
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:04,411
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to talk about?

1084
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,253
Why didn't you call?

1085
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,800
Why didn't you call me?

1086
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:26,349
I mean, did I not deserve any more
explanation than...

1087
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,977
...that letter?

1088
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,688
You couldn't have called me?

1089
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:35,400
You couldn't have given me some
sort of chance to change your mind?

1090
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:38,320
Don't you think you owed me that?

1091
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,200
I couldn't.

1092
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:45,452
You couldn't?

1093
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:49,372
You thought that little of me
that you couldn't have just called me.

1094
01:33:49,915 --> 01:33:51,833
Why?

1095
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:54,336
Because I couldn't.

1096
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,838
Give me an answer.
Why? Why not?

1097
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,715
- Because I couldn't.
- An answer.

1098
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:02,469
Because just hearing your voice,
I would have changed my mind.

1099
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:12,270
Is that what you wanna hear, John?
What you came all this way to hear?

1100
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:16,691
You think it was tough out there?
Think it was easy for me without you?

1101
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:19,069
You thought that
every single day it wasn't...

1102
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:23,114
...a goddamn marathon
of my life without you?

1103
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,116
Tim was sick.

1104
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:28,078
He was sick and he needed me.

1105
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:29,871
He needed me to help him.

1106
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:33,166
He needed me to help him
with Alan, with everything.

1107
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:36,753
I was alone and I had no idea
what I was doing.

1108
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:43,009
I didn't plan this. I didn't know
that it was gonna happen to me.

1109
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:45,303
But it did.

1110
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,597
You don't think I've tried--?

1111
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:50,892
I picked up the phone
a thousand times to try to call you.

1112
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:55,146
You think that I really wanna be
standing here in front of you like this?

1113
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,152
I had no choice.

1114
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:03,947
I know.

1115
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,334
I saved every single one of them.

1116
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,046
You've been so many places.

1117
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:27,387
I think the yellow envelopes
are from Africa or something.

1118
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,472
Really?

1119
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:33,351
I even have your first,
your very first letter to me.

1120
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,313
Tim's water bill.

1121
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:48,575
Sorry.

1122
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,119
It's okay.

1123
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:56,708
Hope you have more
where that came from.

1124
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:27,113
I'm gonna put a pot of coffee on.

1125
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:49,886
I should go.

1126
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,694
I'll see you soon, then?

1127
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,118
Say it back.

1128
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:18,289
When I say it, you say it.

1129
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:21,167
Remember?

1130
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:28,716
John?

1131
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,304
Just say it.

1132
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:46,609
Goodbye, Savannah.

1133
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:48,922
I don't think you remember me. But I
believe you knew my father, Bill Tyree.

1134
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:52,884
Oh, yeah, of course I did. I haven't
seen him in a while, though. How is he?

1135
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,511
He recently passed.

1136
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:58,681
I'm sorry.

1137
01:38:59,224 --> 01:39:03,186
I think you might've offered to buy his
coin collection one time. ls that right?

1138
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,480
Sure did. More than once.

1139
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:09,525
Just out of curiosity, how much do you
think a collection like his is worth?

1140
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:13,613
A collection that big?
I don't know, I'd have to see it.

1141
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,869
Look, I only got about one condition.

1142
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:23,873
All the mules,
they gotta stay together.

1143
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,918
You can sell them as a set
or keep them for yourself.

1144
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:28,419
They have to stay together.

1145
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:30,713
You're really going to sell me
all his coins?

1146
01:39:30,881 --> 01:39:32,548
Yes, sir.

1147
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,384
All but one.

1148
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:40,014
This comes up nickel, we're gonna
set up right here. We got shade.

1149
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:43,059
It comes up penny, we'll be up
on the ridge. We got visibility.

1150
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:49,023
- That'd be penny side.
- All right, let's go to the ridge.

1151
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:54,195
Sergeant.

1152
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:56,823
Thank you.

1153
01:40:01,912 --> 01:40:03,538
<i>Dear John...</i>

1154
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:08,001
<i>...it's been almost five years</i>
<i>since I wrote with an actual pen...</i>

1155
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:10,294
<i>...on an actual sheet of paper.</i>

1156
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,256
<i>I thought I could write and tell you...</i>

1157
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,259
<i>...all that's happened</i>
<i>since I saw you last.</i>

1158
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:19,095
<i>A few weeks</i>
<i>after you showed up here...</i>

1159
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,765
<i>...Tim received</i>
<i>an anonymous donation.</i>

1160
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:24,851
<i>A donation that was enough</i>
<i>to give him...</i>

1161
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,520
<i>...what the insurance companies</i>
<i>wouldn't:</i>

1162
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:30,231
<i>Time.</i>

1163
01:40:33,318 --> 01:40:35,945
<i>Time to finally come home.</i>

1164
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:39,907
<i>Time to spend with his son.</i>

1165
01:40:41,618 --> 01:40:43,661
<i>Time to say goodbye.</i>

1166
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:48,249
<i>The problem with time,</i>
<i>I've learned...</i>

1167
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:51,878
<i>...whether it's those first two weeks</i>
<i>I got to spend with you...</i>

1168
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:55,006
<i>...or those final two months</i>
<i>I got to spend with him...</i>

1169
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:58,301
<i>...eventually time always runs out.</i>

1170
01:41:01,513 --> 01:41:04,807
<i>I have no idea where you are</i>
<i>out there in the world, John.</i>

1171
01:41:05,517 --> 01:41:09,312
<i>But I understand that I Lost the right</i>
<i>to know these things long ago.</i>

1172
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:14,817
<i>No matter how many years go by...</i>

1173
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:19,655
<i>...I know one thing</i>
<i>to be as true as it ever was.</i>

1174
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:24,035
<i>I'll see you soon, then.</i>
