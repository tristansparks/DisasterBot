Sounds good.

176
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,945
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.

177
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,954
You should stay.

178
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,252
No, I really... I'm... I...

179
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,259
I have to get up so early.

180
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,261
I would like you
to call me.

181
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,093
Would you do that?
I would like it.

182
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,156
Yes.

183
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,435
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

184
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,372
That'd be nice.

What took you so long?

188
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,085
I just walked in.

189
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,747
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

190
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,053
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

191
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,059
Oh!
[Laughs]

192
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,062
You said "I do."
I guess that means were married.

193
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,064
[Laughs]
I guess so.

194
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,600
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

It's really solid
this time of year.

I think I should go back.
Come on. Come on!

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,174
What if it breaks?

210
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,177
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?

211
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,406
Come here. Please.

00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,339
Think I heard a crack.

220

[Laughing]
It's not gonna crack
or break or...

221
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,235
It's so thick.

222
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,509

Right there.
See?

00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,170
Sort of a swoop
and a cross.

Nope.

Can I help you with something?

I don't know where that is.

they'd light the number,
or at least put a number on...

Is that him?

I'm willing to be

I know, honey.
For being honest.

I should just go to her house.

You don't wanna go there, man.

make a clean break. Right?

No, no, no, no.

What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

You're gonna make this
about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,237
That's great.
That's good.
[Dog Barks]

347
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,250
Okay.

348
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,467
What is it?
[Rob] I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.

349
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,377
[Woman]
Good morning. Lacuna.

350
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,379
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired
after the new year.

351
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,287
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

352
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,661
How about on the fifth?

353
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,133
That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

354
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,736
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

355
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,401
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

356
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,411
May I help you?

357
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,414
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?

358
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:54,043
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...

359
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,053
Mierzwiak.

360
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,420
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

361
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,482
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.
Really?

362
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,654
- Thank you.
- [Mutters] Great.

363
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,663
I don't have a pen.

364
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,825
There's a pen right there.
[Phone Rings]

365
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,835
Good morning. Lacuna.
Oh.

366
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,771
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.

367
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,831
Mr. Barish?

368
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,145
How are we today?

369
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,147
Not too good, actually.

370
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,149
Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!

371
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,152
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!

372
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,519
[Mutters]
Sorry. Sorry.

373
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,582
[Whispers]
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

374
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,528
You should not
have seen this.

375
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,587
I apologize.

376
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,902
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

377
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,804
I assure you, no.
[Woman]
No.

378
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,976
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

379
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,680
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

380
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,221
so I can't show you evidence.

381
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:10,023
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

382
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,154
and she wanted to move on.

383
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,164
[Dr. Mierzwiak]
We provide that possibility.

384
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:18,293
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.
[Banging]

385
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,895
We provide
that possibility."

386
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,906
What the hell is that?

387
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,909
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

388
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,911
[Rob]
Oww! Fuck!

389
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,413
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

390
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,416
It's okay.
It's all right.

391
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,180
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

392
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,955
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

393
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,823
She's impulsive.

394
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,455
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

395
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,300
[Sighs]

396
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,302
A lark.

397
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,806
[Sobbing]
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

398
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,140
[Woman]
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

399
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,147
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

400
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,207
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

401
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,652
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

402
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,657
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

403
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,286
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.

404
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,027
Now, the, uh...

405
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,037
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

406
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,039
is to go home...

407
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:34,545
and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.

408
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,842
Anything.

409
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,548
And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.

410
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,214
Okay?

411
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,353
So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

412
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:55,388
books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,

413
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,095
journal entries.

414
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,932
We want to empty your home...

415
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:04,338
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

416
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,903
And after the mapping is done,
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

417
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,313
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

418
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:16,820
you'll find yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...

419
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,379
a new life awaiting you.

420
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,852
[Tires Screech]
[Driver]
Wake up, buddy!

421
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,832
[Mary]
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

422
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,067
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

423
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,737
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

424
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,474
Hello. I'm right here.

425
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,747
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.

426
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,256
Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a- and he...

427
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:56,589
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like
to come in this week?

428
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,097
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy
this afternoon.

429
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:04,124
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

430
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,071
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

431
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,300
[Chuckles]

432
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,309
[Knocks]

433
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,937
## [Dixieland Jazz]

434
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,277
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

435
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,942
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

436
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,952
## [Continues]

437
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,511
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

438
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,023
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

439
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,025
My name is Joel Barish,

440
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,655
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

441
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:38,759
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

442
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,362
Uh, I was...

443
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:45,239
living with this woman, Naomi,

444
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,870
uh, a couple years ago,

445
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:53,179
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.

446
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,482
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

447
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,717
and I, uh, met Clementine.

448
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,783
[Pencils Clattering On Floor]
I'm sorry.

449
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,796
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

450
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,459
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

451
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,468
There's an emotional core...

452
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,470
to each of our memories,

453
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,304
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

454
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,809
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

455
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,609
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

456
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,706
as in a dream upon waking.

457
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,082
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

458
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,145
Well, uh, technically speaking,

459
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,157
the procedure is brain damage,

460
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,058
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

461
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,062
Nothing you'll miss.

462
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,530
Comfortable?

463
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:47,230
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

464
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,637
[Mierzwiak]
Okay, let's get started.

465
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:53,438
If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

466
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,345
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

467
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,940
[Clementine Whooping, Laughing]

468
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,452
There's a good story
behind this one...

469
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,455
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better
emotional readout...

470
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:09,425
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

471
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,428
Just try to focus on the memories.

472
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,056
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

473
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:20,270
[Stan]
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. Very good.

474
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,603
- Here's another object.
- [Clementine's Voice]
That's so...

475
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,269
Next item. Okay.

476
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,779
Potato head.
[Chuckles]

477
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,112
- Next item. Okay.
- [Electronic Crackling]

478
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:38,053
[Stan, Voice Electronically Processed]
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.

479
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,455
[Stan] Hey, Patrick,
do me a favor, will ya?
[Patrick] Yeah.

480
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:45,394
[Stan]
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?

481
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,397
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?

482
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,458
Well, I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.
I'm... [Scoffs]

483
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:59,536
[Mierzwiak's Voice, Distant]
Well, uh, technically the procedure
is brain damage.

484
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,079
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.

485
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,512
Oh, there you are.
I...

486
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,952
Why am I...
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

487
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,827
Why am I
standing here and...

488
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,731
Oh, my God.
Deja vu.

489
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,894
Deja vu.
This is so...

490
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,905
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

491
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,908
[Simultaneously]
underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

492
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,501
[Whispering]
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

493
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,912
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

494
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,974
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.

495
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,488
Very good.

496
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,820
[Simultaneously]
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

497
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,225
That way you won't be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

498
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,559
[Stan]
Ah, there we go.

499
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,064
Patrick?
Yeah?

500
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,795
[Stan's Voice, Echoing]
Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?

501
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,327
I'm getting some sort of readout
of my own voice.
Patrick? Patrick?

502
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:05,308
- Why are there so many wires?
- [Stan] A lot of equipment.

503
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:09,176
- Does that help?
- [Stan] Are you sure
you set that thing up properly?

504
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,181
[Patrick] How's that?
[Mary] How are you today,
Mr. Barish?

505
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,342
There we are,
Mr. Barish.
[Stan's Voice] That's better.

506
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,751
- I don't know if I like this.

It's a quote book, Patrick.

Like if I can transform her,
[Sniffles]

840
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:03,105
I would magically change too.

841
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,785
You're pretty.

842
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,016
Joely, don't ever leave me.

843
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:17,116
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

844
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,130
[Joel's Voice]
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

845
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,132
Just this one.

846
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,135
[Clementine]
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

847
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,898
Whoo!
Whoa!

848
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,905
[Clementine Whoops]
Stop it!

849
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:31,964
[Clementine Laughing]

850
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,005
I could die right now, Clem.

851
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,238
I'm just...

852
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,212
happy.

853
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,783
I've never felt that before.

854
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,859
Mmm.

855
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,918
I'm just exactly...

856
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,156
where I wanna be.

857
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,226
Clem?

858
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,934
I wanna call it off.

859
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,003
I'll give you a sign.

860
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,343
I wanna call it off!

861
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,691
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

862
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,125
I wanna call it off!

863
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:29,029
[Stereo: Man]
# When you ain't got nothing to do #

864
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,090
# I think I'll marry you ##

865
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,933
[Screaming]
Is anybody there?

866
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:41,276
[Loud Groaning]

867
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,835
Clementine?
Joel?

868
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,143
Clement...
Joely?

869
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,309
Clem!
Joel?

870
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,183
Clem!

871
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,484
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

872
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,990
What? Where?
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

873
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,391
Stop what?

874
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,395
Joely.
Come on, Clem.

875
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,762
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!

876
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,393
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!

877
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,403
No.
Good.

878
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,837
Concentrate, Clem.

879
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,398
We gotta get back
to the office.

880
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,001
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.

881
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,104
Not the picture.

882
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,241
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!

883
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,980
[Clementine]
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.

884
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:27,751
[Mierzwiak]
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

885
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,758
so I can't show you evidence.

886
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:33,227
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski...

887
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:37,164
was not happy
and she wanted to move on.

888
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:41,761
Good. Now, tell me about Clementine.
[Joel]
Just tell me everything you remember.

889
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,705
That's what he said. Then...
What did we see that day?

890
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,708
No, wait.
Oh, look! Hey!

891
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,267
Shit!
We're going to see
my grandma.

892
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,042
Joel, why... No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.

893
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,879
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!

894
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,283
Mierzwiak!

895
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,323
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!

896
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,684
[Dog Barking]

897
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,633
Please.

898
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,068
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me...

899
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,231
everything you can remember.

900
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,798
[Joel]
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

901
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,902
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

902
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,971
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

903
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,212
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

904
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,220
You're erasing me from her...

905
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,692
I don't know.

906
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,423
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

907
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,431
I'm in my brain.

908
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,400
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.

909
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,096
How can I help you
from there?

910
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,663
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.

911
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,370
[Grunts]
Sorry.

912
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,504
Look. Who's that?

913
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,639
Oh, he-he works for us.

914
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:04,380
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

915
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,048
baby boy.

916
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,614
He's stealing my identity.

917
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,092
He stole my stuff.

918
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,859
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

919
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,129
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

920
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,136
He stole her underwear.

921
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,605
[Door Closes]
I could die right now, Clem.

922
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,142
I'm just happy.

923
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,806
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where
I want to be.

924
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,340
I want to go home.

925
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,387
Hey. What?

926
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,453
Clem!
[Grunting]

927
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,518
Wait. Clem!

928
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,792
Clem?

929
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:52,334
They're erasing you.
[Dog Barks]

930
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,336
I'm here!
[Screams]

931
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,066
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?
[Laughing]

932
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,074
I'm so stupid.

933
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,168
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

934
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,578
I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.

935
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:11,449
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

936
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,752
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

937
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,587
Wake yourself up!

938
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,423
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

939
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,397
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.

940
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,491
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

941
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,695
Yeah. Okay.

942
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,001
Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.

943
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,599
[Mary Laughs]
Don't! That tickles me!
[Stan] Oh, my goodness.

944
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,110
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...

945
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,113
[Mary]
It's a birthmark!

946
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,682
It did work, for a second,

947
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:47,279
but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?

948
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:52,021
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

949
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,427
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually...

950
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:57,660
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

951
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:01,067
Fine.

952
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,129
Then what? I'm listening.

953
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,903
I don't know.
You erased me.

954
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,638
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this
in the first place.

955
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,646
I'm sorry.
You... You!

956
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,148
You know me. I'm impulsive.

957
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,546
That's what I love
about you.

958
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,850
[Beeping]
[Clementine]
Joel?

959
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:27,897
[Joel] Mm-hmm?
I have another idea
for this problem.

960
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,228
This is a memory of me,

961
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,999
the way you wanted
to have sex on the couch after you
looked down at my crotch.

962
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,006
What?
Joel, the eraser guys
are coming here,

963
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,066
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

964
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,305
somewhere
where I don't belong,

965
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,939
and we hide there
till morning?

966
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,754
[Sighs]
Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

967
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:56,986
[Scoffs]
Tsk, that's very sweet,
but try, okay?

968
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,994
Okay.

969
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:04,364
# Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream #

970
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,664
# Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily #

971
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:10,365
# Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream #

972
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,375
# Row, row, row your boat #
[Both]
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily #

973
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:17,106
# Life is but a dream #
[Boy]
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily #

974
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,978
# Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily #

975
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:23,280
# Life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat #

976
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,412
It's working!
# Row, row, row your boat #

977
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:29,049
# Gently down the stream ##
[Clementine]
I'm a genius!

978
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:34,163
[Giggling]

979
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,479
Joel?

980
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,742
Joel?

981
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,646
Where'd you go?

982
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,517
I'm supposed to come too!

983
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:03,116
[Woman] Listen, I'm just gonna
go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

984
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,126
[Woman #2]
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.

985
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,162
Absolutely!
Clem?

986
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:11,394
It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!

987
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:15,631
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!

988
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:20,267
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

989
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,743
Who am I?

990
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,712
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

991
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,341
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

992
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,716
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

993
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,278
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

994
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:37,053
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

995
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,186
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.

996
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,788
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

997
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,857
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.

998
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,063
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.
[Laughing]

999
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:52,471
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

1000
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,534
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!

1001
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:58,136
Is every little peanut
under there okay?
Mm-hmm! He's fine.

1002
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,546
Do you have something to drink?

1003
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:03,278
Would you drink
a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

1004
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,843
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.

1005
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,652
Okay! I'm just
gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

1006
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,659
[Grunting]
Uh, Joely.

1007
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,356
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.

1008
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,799
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know,
you've had your dinner.

1009
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:20,893
[Angry Grunt]
Come on, Joel!

1010
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,904
Joel, grow up!

1011
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,338
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.
[Sobbing]

1012
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,842
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.

1013
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,209
[Crying]
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.

1014
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,580
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

1015
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:38,449
Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

1016
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,354
Hey, honey, look.

1017
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,415
Wait there.

1018
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:49,526
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

1019
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,533
Yuck.

1020
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,127
[Buzzing]

1021
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:57,695
[Buzzing]
It stopped.

1022
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,505
What?
It stopped erasing.

1023
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:04,011
Oh, shit.

1024
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,071
This is terrible.

1025
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,915
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

1026
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:13,547
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean? I don't know where!

1027
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:17,719
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

1028
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,354
Okay. Crap.

1029
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:23,193
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

1030
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,826
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

1031
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,132
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

1032
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,832
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?

1033
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:34,502
I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.

1034
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:38,411
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

1035
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,507
Quiet. You're freaking me out.
Shh. Shh.

1036
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,576
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.

1037
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,588
Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.

1038
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,590
Oh, shit.
Oh! Oh!

1039
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,126
What? Oh! What, what?
What?

1040
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:54,129
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

1041
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,358
This is my...
I can handle this.

1042
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,730
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.

1043
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,497
He's... There's no time
to fuck around.

1044
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,062
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

1045
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,007
Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.

1046
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,670
[Phone Rings]

1047
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,681
[Rings]

1048
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,117
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.

1049
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:22,021
Um, I'm working on this guy
down here, and we seem to have
lost him for a moment,

1050
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,855
and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.

1051
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:28,363
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

1052
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,832
Well, I wasn't sure, really,
'cause I was away from the monitor
for a minute...

1053
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,597
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh...

1054
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,604
I had to pee.

1055
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:40,369
Where's Patrick?
Patrick? Patrick had to
go home sick.

1056
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,377
Ah, geez.

1057
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:45,209
Okay, what's the address?
I know. I'm so sorry.

1058
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:48,978
That's okay. Come on.
[Stan]
I'm at 159 South Village.

1059
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,214
Yeah.
Apartment 1 E.
Rockville Center.

1060
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,950
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?

1061
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,958
I'm staying.
[Bottles Clinking]

1062
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:59,392
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

1063
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,953
I think you should go.
Hell, no.

1064
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:05,626
Mary... Shit.

1065
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:09,694
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.

1066
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:12,138
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.

1067
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,006
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

1068
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:19,241
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!

1069
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,512
Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!

1070
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,917
[Blubbering]

1071
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,415
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.

1072
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:34,020
It's weird how strong
that desire is.
Joel, look at me! Look.

1073
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,428
You'll remember me
in the morning,

1074
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,662
and you'll come to me,
and you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

1075
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,101
Pat? I just... Pat?

1076
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,332
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

1077
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,875
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.

1078
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,934
What Patrick guy?

1079
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,774
That guy!
What?

1080
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,711
He's here in my apartment.

1081
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,716
He's one of those eraser guys.

1082
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:59,118
He fell for you when they were doing you,
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

1083
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,520
and you guys are dating.

1084
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,821
Really? Is he cute?

1085
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,629
Clem,
there's nothing wrong with you.

1086
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:12,293
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

1087
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:15,303
You... You're kind,

1088
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:17,601
[Sobbing]
beautiful...

1089
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:19,903
and smart and funny...

1090
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,206
and... nice.

1091
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,508
What?

1092
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:28,182
Okay. All right.

1093
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,017
Okay. Oh!

1094
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,386
Move, move, move!
Come on. Let's go.
Careful, careful.

1095
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,254
Fine.

1096
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,726
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.
[Groans]

1097
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,195
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1098
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,596
[Chuckles]
[Doorbell Ringing]

1099
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,862
[Clears Throat]

1100
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:48,870
Be cool. Cool.

1101
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,740
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.

1102
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,745
She was just here to help out.

1103
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,976
I wanted to understand as much
as I could about the procedure
as possible.

1104
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,747
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings...

1105
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,015
of the work that we do.

1106
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,785
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

1107
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,556
by people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

1108
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,655
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

1109
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,292
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

1110
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,359
Uh, yeah. Um...

1111
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,574
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.

1112
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:30,408
Did you try going
through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.

1113
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,276
I mean... yes.

1114
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,578
Yeah.

1115
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,709
[Clears Throat]

1116
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,720
All right.

1117
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,190
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

1118
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,556
All right.

1119
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,255
I already... I ran
the utility programs,

1120
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,320
and I had nothing there,

1121
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,390
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1122
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,459
Here, Howard.
Okay.

1123
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,937
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.

1124
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,566
You're welcome.
Whew!

1125
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:03,237
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through
the entire memory,

1126
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,303
see if something comes up.

1127
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:08,748
# Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling #

1128
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,981
# Oh, my darling Clementine #

1129
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,545
# You were lost
and gone forever #
I love being bathed in the sink.

1130
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:17,114
# Dreadful sorry, Clementine ##
Such a feeling of security.

1131
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,424
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.
[Giggling] Hmm!

1132
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,430
There it is.

1133
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:26,832
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1134
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,961
What the heck
was he doing there?

1135
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,869
[Grunts]

1136
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,333

[Coughing]

1138
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,538
His eyes are open.

1139
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:46,013
- Has this happened before with him?
- [Stan] No.

1140
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,649
Oh, this is...
this is not good. No.

1141
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,955
I'm gonna have to...

1142
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,961
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1143
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,311
[Gasps, Panting]

1144
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,015
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1145
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,253
[Mierzwiak]
Okay, we're back in.

1146
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:28,558
[Mary]
Wow. That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.

1147
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:32,658
Like a surgeon
or a concert pianist
or something.

1148
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,669
Thank you, Mary.

1149
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:38,833
Um, Howard,
you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

1150
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:43,470
Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1151
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:45,537
Hmm. Lucky me.

1152
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:50,017
Lay one on me.
[Kissing Sounds]
[Kissing Sounds]

1153
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:53,280
Don't call me Antoine.

1154
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,755
My name is Wally.
Yes, I know,

1155
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,384
but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1156
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,860
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1157
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,626
Hey.
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1158
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,190
There is?
[Giggling]

1159
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,804
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1160
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,898
[Crying]
What, Joel... What are you doing?
We gotta go.

1161
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,637
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

1162
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,379
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1163
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,246
Clem, come on!

1164
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,219
There I am.
[Tires Screech]

1165
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,221

[Distorted Voice]
All right, let's begin
by you telling me...

1168
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:37,227
everything you remember...

1169
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:41,201
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1170
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,331
Oh, well, at least
we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

Come on, Clem.

1172
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,435
[Stan's Voice]
He seems to have developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.

1173
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,106
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.

1174
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,711
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1175
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:01,517
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

- No, wait. Howard.

I'm so sorry, Howard.

Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...

Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

like famous quotes?

01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,311
I find reading them inspirational,

1274

I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.

1276
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,527
There's one that goes,

1277
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:44,088
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

Yeah.

And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.
Oh, no.

01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:52,365
It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,433
Yeah. Oh, and there's
this other one I like.

1282
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,343
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes...

Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.

1284
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,883
Yeah, shit.

1285
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,785
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"
and sound like a dope,

1286
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,846
and then I go ahead and say it.

It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1288

- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

1321
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:43,108
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

with a stupid crush!
Yeah.

I swear I basically
forced him into it!

01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:52,045
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1325
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:57,453
Tell me what?

1326
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,517
Oh, you poor kid.

1327
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,622
You can have him.

1328
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,631
You did.

1329
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,132
What?

1330
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,938
Oh, uh,

01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:29,549
we have a history.

1332
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:32,184
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1333
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,421
You...

1334
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,987
You wanted it done...

1335
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:40,364
so you could get past, uh...

1336
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,061
You could... Yeah.

1337
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:50,500
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1338
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,570
It's almost morning.

1339
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,773
We'll talk later.

1340
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,719
Okay?

1341
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,632
[Stan]
Hey.

1342
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,561
Let me give you a lift home.

1343
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,708
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1344
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:33,379
Hi.
Hi.

1345
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:37,391
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

1346
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:40,690
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1347
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:42,730
You did run away,
after all.

1348
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:45,561
I just needed to see ya.

1349
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,932
Yeah?

1350
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:50,733
I'd like to, um,

1351
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:53,774
take you out or something.

1352
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,402
You're married.

1353
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,912
Not yet. Not married.

1354
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,914
No, I'm not married, no.

1355
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:04,008
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance,

1356
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:08,647
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1357
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,055
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1358
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:14,254
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1359
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,490
Okay.

1360
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:19,465
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1361
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,332
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1362
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:26,033
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1363
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:30,771
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech
really well.

1364
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:34,337
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole
human race pegged.

1365
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,407
Hmm. Probably.

1366
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,884
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1367
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,890
even after that.

1368
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,359
Mmm. I know.

1369
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,688
It would be different...

1370
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,233
if we could just give it
another go around.

1371
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:00,572
Remember me.

1372
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,633
Try your best.

1373
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,914
Maybe we can.

1374
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:41,114
[Mierzwiak]
Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

1375
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,776
and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.

1376
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,082
[Mary]
Okay.

1377
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:49,055
I liked you immediately.

1378
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,615
You didn't
come on to me at all.

1379
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,685
I liked that.

1380
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,732
I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.

1381
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,461
I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1382
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:04,001
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1383
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:07,564
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

1384
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:11,009
and having kids and... just...

1385
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:13,775
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1386
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:16,442
[Mierzwiak]
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1387
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,986
[Mary Crying]
Yeah, I know.

1388
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,988
Oh, God.

1389
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,415
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1390
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,425
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1391
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:27,984
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...

1392
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,657
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.

1393
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,666
No, no, no, no!

1394
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,895
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

1395
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:37,961
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1396
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,938
[Joel]
This is the day we met.

1397
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:46,208
You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.

1398
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,408
I remember being drawn to you
even then.

1399
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:52,613
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."

1400
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:57,552
You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...

1401
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,593
and even hate, eventually.

1402
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:03,654
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1403
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:06,461
Hi there.

1404
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:08,468
Hi.

1405
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,471
I saw you sitting over here...

1406
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,473
by yourself,

1407
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:16,442
and I thought, "Thank God.

1408
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:19,309
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either."

1409
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,507
Yeah.

1410
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,609
I don't ever know what to say.

1411
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:27,416
I'm Clementine.

1412
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:30,652
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1413
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:32,955
And then you just took it...

1414
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:35,552
without waiting for an answer.

1415
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,591
It was so intimate,

1416
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:44,797
like we were already lovers.

1417
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,671
I'm Joel.

1418
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,903
Hi, Joel.

1419
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:53,209
So, no jokes about my name.

1420
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:57,741
You mean like...
# Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine #

1421
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,310
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1422
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:02,413
Yeah. Like that.

1423
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,424
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1424
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:08,223
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1425
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,287
Oh.

1426
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:14,565
I think your name is magical.

1427
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,770
This is it, Joel.

1428
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,036
It's gonna be gone soon.

1429
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,511
I know.

1430
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:28,515
What do we do?

1431
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:33,410
Enjoy it.

1432
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:52,369
[Clementine]
You married?
No.

1433
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,068
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1434
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,043
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1435
01:26:57,111 --> 01:27:00,478
Male or female?
What?

1436
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,982
Female. Female.

1437
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:08,611
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1438
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:15,385
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.

1439
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,331
They might have a dog.

1440
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:22,062
[Giggling]
There's no dog.

1441
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,127
What are you doing?

1442
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,470
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.

1443
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,511
Hoo-hoo!

1444
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:34,412
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!

1445
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,749
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1446
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:46,953
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1447
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,631
It's dark.

1448
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:55,692
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1449
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:59,001
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

1450
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,473
We're...
[Laughing]
Whatever.

1451
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:05,638
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um,
candles, matches...

1452
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:08,181
and the liquor cabinet.

1453
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:11,514
Oh, God.

1454
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:16,018
[Tapping Phone Receiver Button]

1455
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,955
I think we should go.

1456
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:20,620
There's no phone line.
What?

1457
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,856
I think we should go.
Why?

1458
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:25,524
It's our house...
just for tonight.
[Sighs]

1459
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,569
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1460
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:32,138
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...

1461
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:35,698
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1462
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:40,544
What are you do...
[Chuckling]

1463
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:42,845
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.

1464
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:45,511
So, are you okay with wine?

1465
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,248
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.

1466
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:52,555
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

1467
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:58,727
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.

1468
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:03,596
[Wind Howling]
I've gotta catch my ride.

1469
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,931
So go.

1470
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,102
I did.

1471
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:13,045
[Joel's Voice]
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1472
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,912
but you were exciting.

1473
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,952
[Clementine]
I wish you'd stayed.

1474
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,716
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1475
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:24,849
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1476
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:27,258
Oh, God, I wish I had...

1477
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:34,360
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1478
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:38,997
Well, I came back downstairs,
and you were gone.
I walked out. I walked out the door.

1479
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:41,906
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.

1480
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:45,309
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.

1481
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,314
You were scared?

1482
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,316
Yeah.

1483
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:52,979
Thought you knew that
about me.

1484
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:57,047
[Joel's Voice]
I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1485
01:29:57,125 --> 01:30:00,754
[Clementine]
Was it something I said?
Yeah.

1486
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:05,931
You said, "So go"...

1487
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,468
with such disdain, you know?

1488
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,164
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1489
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,678
Joely?

1490
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,613
What if you stayed this time?

1491
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:26,913
I walked out the door.

1492
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:28,922
There's no memory left.

1493
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:32,118
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

1494
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:34,127
Let's pretend we had one.

1495
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:47,730
Bye, Joel.

1496
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,743
[Joel]
I love you.

1497
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:54,077
[Whispering]
Meet me in Montauk.

1498
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:01,950
[Rob] I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.

1499
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:06,119
[Carrie] You were operating the plane
with the remote control,
and then it crashed.

1500
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:08,526
[Rob]
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.

1501
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,564
[Carrie]
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1502
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,191
[Rob]
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.

1503
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:15,792
That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.

1504
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:19,499
It does.
That's a medical fact.

1505
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:22,008
It was proven
on the Science Network.

1506
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:24,510
[Carrie]
Honey, just watch the road.
[Rob] I can't see shit.

1507
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:30,073
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1508
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,984
She was nice.
Yeah, man. Who was that?

1509
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:38,388
She was, um, just a girl.

1510
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,831
[Beep]

1511
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,767
Okay.

1515
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:27,036
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.

1516
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:29,201
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1517
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:32,610
We'll talk.

Hey!

1522
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:55,628
Hey.

1523
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,828
You got a lot
of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1524
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:03,336
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.

1525
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:07,135
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.

1526
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:10,803
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not. God, no.

1527
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:13,073
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1528
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:17,379
[Sighs, Clears Throat]
Once, maybe.

1529
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:20,443
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

1530
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:23,115
I saw you two talking.

1531
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,921
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, you know.

1532
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,292
How'd I look?

1533
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:32,665
You looked happy.

1534
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:34,997
Happy with a secret.

1535
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:38,338
And after that?

1536
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:41,569
I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just...

1537
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:45,339
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased."

1563
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:26,930
I have since decided
that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1564
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:31,569

In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.

1565

[On Tape]
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1566
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:38,046
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1567
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,348
What is this?
I don't know.

1568
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:45,017
He's boring.
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?

1569
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:48,789
I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,

1570
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:50,797
and it's like he changed me.

1571

I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.

he does, you know?
- What are you doing?

1574
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:05,077
I'm not doing anything.

fucking off the rose at this point.

Hey, Clementine.
Hey.

01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:32,127
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1589
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:35,067
Yeah.

1590
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,126
[Joel On Tape]
Really very educated.

1591
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:40,640
I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.

1592
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:43,609
I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?

1593
01:39:43,677 --> 01:39:47,113
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1594
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:50,582
Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.

1595
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:53,313
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...

1596
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:55,378
Hi.
because she would pronounce...

1597
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:58,220
library "libary."
Hi.

1598
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:01,420
Libary. Libary.

Look what I found.

1600
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:07,831
[On Tape] I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,

1601
01:40:07,901 --> 01:40:11,564
it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.

1602
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,272
You made me look skinny.

1603
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:17,902
Amazing, burning meteorite...

1604
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:22,278
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting.

1605
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:25,375
But what you quickly learn
is that...

1606
01:40:25,452 --> 01:40:28,285
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1607
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:30,346
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1608
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:34,689
It's okay.
So flashy
in a kind of obvious way.

1609
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:38,957
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.

1610
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,263
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1611
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:45,795
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.

1612
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:49,109
Where's the real Clementine?

1613
01:40:49,176 --> 01:40:52,304
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.

1614
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:55,109
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1615
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:57,412
I really like your hair.
Thank you.

1616
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:59,418
I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.

1617
01:40:59,486 --> 01:41:03,115
Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?

1618
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:05,920
Do you have any whiskey?

1619
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:11,295
No, I don't think her sex
is... motivated.

1620
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:14,357
I saw it clearly
the last night we were together.

1621
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:17,836
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.

1622
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:20,965
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1623
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:24,704
The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...

1624
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:27,611
is to fuck 'em...

1625
01:41:27,681 --> 01:41:31,913
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of 'em.

1626
01:41:31,985 --> 01:41:34,920
And she's so desperate
and insecure...

1627
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:39,823
that she'll, sooner or later,
go around fucking everybody.

1628
01:41:39,893 --> 01:41:42,919
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that
about you.

1629
01:41:42,996 --> 01:41:45,897
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1630
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:49,197
Because it really hurts me
that you said that
because I don't do that.

1631
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:52,363
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.

1632
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:57,240
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1633
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:05,044
Um... bye.

1634
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,747
Bye.
[On Tape]
I thought I knew her so well.

1635
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:11,416
It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.

1636
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:16,093
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,

1637
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:20,065
only to find out
that she's a stranger.

1638
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:25,361
Wait.

1639
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,974
What?
I don't know.

1640
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:31,203
Just wait. Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?

1641
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:35,806
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.

[Quiet Sob]

1643
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:52,059
Okay.
Really?

1644
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:56,262
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking
for my own peace of mind.

1645
01:42:56,336 --> 01:43:00,272
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1646
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,036
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.

1647
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:06,739
You know, you will think of things,
and I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped...

1648
01:43:06,813 --> 01:43:08,872
because that's what happens
with me.

1649
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:12,284
Okay.

1650
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:17,980
Okay.

1651
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:22,026
[Crying]

1652
01:43:22,095 --> 01:43:25,258

Okay.
