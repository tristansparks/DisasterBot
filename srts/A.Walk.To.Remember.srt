Enjoy the Movie.

2
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,061
- Is he here yet?
- No.

3
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,332
- You scared him.
- I gotta take a massive piss.

4
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:13,102
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

5
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:30,367
Anyone got any beer?

6
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:35,598
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

7
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:39,678
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

8
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:44,320
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,180
- Thanks a lot, Eric.
- Anytime, anywhere.

10
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,331
- This is gonna be sweet.
- I'm glad I thought of it.

11
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:54,092
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

12
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:58,132
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

13
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:02,534
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

14
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:07,275
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

15
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:11,645
Belinda, why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

16
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:15,047
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

17
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:17,157
You know I don't dance.

18
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:21,028
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

19
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:25,529
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

20
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,099
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

21
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:30,710
Like yourself.

22
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,171
He's here!

23
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:34,971
All right, here he comes.

24
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:39,142
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

25
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:42,723
I can't wait to see you fly!

26
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,254
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

27
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,565
You're late.

28
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:00,436
I thought I said be here at 10,
but you know...

29
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:05,548
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

30
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:10,488
If there is a next time!

31
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,160
Dean! Is he always like that?

32
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,320
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

33
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,062
Wait up, baby!

34
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:30,383
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

35
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,909
Okay, here's the deal.

36
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,709
You're gonna jump
from up there into here.

37
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,511
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

38
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,951
- You ready?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,921
All right. All right.

40
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:09,691
Let's do this, okay?

41
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,173
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

42
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:23,335
- How deep is this?
- I don't really know.

43
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,106
Let's go find out.

44
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:30,018
Let's do it.

45
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,624
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

46
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:05,255
Come on, let's go!

47
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:06,924
Jump!

48
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:12,466
- You done this?
- We've all done it.

49
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:17,806
- I hope you had your Wheaties!
- You guys gonna do this tonight?

50
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,918
On three.

51
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,138
One.

52
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:24,049
Two.

53
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,519
Three!

54
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,473
Oh, shit.

55
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:47,043
Landon, he's hurt!

56
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:49,545
- Is he okay?
- Landon, get down here!

57
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,015
- What the hell?
- Dean, what the hell?

58
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,585
- You guys, he's hurt!
- Come on, man!

59
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:59,257
- I told you it was a bad idea!
- Get him out of the water!

60
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:04,597
- Hurry up!
- Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

61
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,228
Help me!

62
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,640
- Get him over here!
- There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,920
Get him out of the water!

64
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,851
Watch his head! Watch his head!

65
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:23,422
Hey, who's down there?

66
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,892
Tracie, come on!

67
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:30,803
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

68
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,994
Come on, Landon.

69
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:35,775
Come on!

70
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,006
You guys, just take him!

71
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:40,205
Give me his arms!

72
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,286
I got him.

73
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,088
We gotta get out of here.

74
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:53,028
- Go! Get out of here!
- Landon, come on!

75
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,900
I told you not to do this!

76
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,630
Calm down.

77
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,911
Belinda, let's go!

78
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:10,513
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

79
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:34,048
Damn it!

80
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,374
Shit!

81
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,910
Put your hands on the wheel.

82
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:01,547
You know, Mama,
my leg really hurts today.

83
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:04,448
I don't think I can go any place.

84
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:09,689
- Maybe I should call your father.
- No.

85
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm not talking to him.

86
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,071
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

87
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:24,672
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

88
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:29,223
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved...

89
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:33,255
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

90
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,807
- So how's the leg, man?
- It's good.

91
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:18,218
I can't believe you were in jail.

92
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:21,979
- What'd you tell them?
- It was a nice night for a drive.

93
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:25,599
Ended up at the cement factory,
found Gephardt.

94
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,930
Tried to help him, got spooked.

95
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,591
Figured I'd leave before
they thought I was involved.

96
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:36,141
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

97
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,642
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

98
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:42,144
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

99
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:44,914
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

100
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:48,114
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

101
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:51,856
A little maintenance,
she might not look bad.

102
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,826
Nice sweater.

103
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,896
Thank you.

104
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,038
Thank you.

105
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:21,962
A student claims you were drinking
on school property.

106
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:24,832
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

107
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:29,995
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

108
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:33,074
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

109
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,275
What, are you gonna expel me?

110
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:37,215
Not yet.

111
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:43,717
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

112
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:47,387
- For pay?
- For the inner satisfaction it brings.

113
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:52,029
Saturdays, you'll tutor students
at our sister school.

114
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,500
You'll take part
in the drama club's final event.

115
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,009
The spring play?

116
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,081
It's time you experienced
other things.

117
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,182
Started spending time
with other kinds of people.

118
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,512
Don't blow it, Landon.

119
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:19,725
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

120
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:23,736
- Does anyone know what it is?
- It's a star frame.

121
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:28,778
This is a star frame.

122
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:32,277
It will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

123
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:38,390
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

124
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,120
Bet you can see angels up there,
flying around.

125
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,160
There are things that
could be called miraculous.

126
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,032
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

127
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:53,533
Well, if there is a higher power...

128
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,342
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

129
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:59,214
He's too busy looking for your brain.

130
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:03,555
Laugh, it's a joke.

131
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,484
- Let's get out of here.
- I gotta stay.

132
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:09,926
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

133
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,227
Come on. Come on.

134
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:16,067
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

135
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:19,328
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

136
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,881
Look at the chart,
you'll see Halley's comet.

137
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,251
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

138
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:36,693
My parents aren't home,
if you want to come inside.

139
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,234
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

140
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:44,493
I know. I just thought...

141
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,264
It's over.

142
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:50,375
Yeah. Whatever.

143
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:02,588
Okay.

144
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,699
Good morning, Landon.

145
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,470
Landon, wake up!

146
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,511
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

147
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,241
Up!

148
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,352
It's Saturday, no school.

149
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,422
Tutoring.

150
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,137
Let's try this again.

151
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:48,648
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

152
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,849
What do you think?

153
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,919
Man, I think this is bullshit!

154
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,431
Makes two of us.

155
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,487
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

156
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:29,727
I'm trying to raise money
to buy Jefferson new computers.

157
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,697
No.

158
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,440
So I saw you in there with Luis.

159
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,239
And I know it can be difficult...

160
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,041
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

161
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:51,792
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

162
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,264
That would be a no.

163
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:02,035
They moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place.

164
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:05,145
Is this your idea of small talk?

165
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:09,116
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

166
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:12,117
- It's called peer pressure.
- How do you know?

167
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:14,587
You read it in your precious book?

168
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:22,659
Please don't pretend
like you know me, okay?

169
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,801
But I do. I do.

170
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,300
We have all the same classes
since kindergarten.

171
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,342
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

172
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:38,312
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

173
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:43,114
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

174
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:45,855
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

175
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,755
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

176
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,525
How's that sound?

177
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:56,507
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

178
00:17:56,707 --> 00:18:00,938
- You don't care what people think?
- No.

179
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:33,686
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

180
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:37,515
This is bullshit. Thanks.

181
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:41,927
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

182
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:45,898
- Be back in an hour.
- Tell them to do West Side Story.

183
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:52,239
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

184
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:57,580
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

185
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,082
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

186
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:08,883
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

187
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,533
Eddie, perhaps-

188
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,294
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

189
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:16,264
Sure.

190
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:20,636
Now then, let's see...

191
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:26,576
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

192
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:30,818
- Sally will be playing Caroline.
- Congratulations.

193
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:34,189
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

194
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:40,160
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

195
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,861
When did you know, Tommy?

196
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:45,501
IKnow what?

197
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:48,071
That we were in love.

198
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,583
Love?

199
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:57,814
Baby, you don't want to fall
in love with a guy like me.

200
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:00,684
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

201
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:05,495
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

202
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:12,967
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

203
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,337
...pour me another glass.

204
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,308
Are you trying to be bad at this?

205
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,680
No, just comes naturally.

206
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:26,920
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

207
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:34,201
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

208
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:38,302
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. See you.

209
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,104
Bye.

210
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:55,157
- So would it kill you to try?
- Yep, and I'm too young to die.

211
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:58,527
You don't care about classes,
but you like school...

212
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:02,458
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

213
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:08,009
- That's thoroughly predictable.
- Your act only works on an audience.

214
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:41,717
Feeling Christian?

215
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,607
Seat belt?

216
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:08,113
- I forfeit.
- Thank you.

217
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:10,583
Forty-two.

218
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,914
What do you mean, forty-two?

219
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,284
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

220
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:21,525
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

221
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:23,756
Like getting a new personality?

222
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:26,938
Join the Peace Corps,
make a medical discovery.

223
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,128
Ambitious.

224
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:32,038
Be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

225
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,808
What's number one?

226
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,581
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

227
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:57,604
I've come...

228
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,174
...to see if you're ready.

229
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:03,315
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

230
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,347
Ready to look into your heart,
Tom Thornton.

231
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:10,687
Your words have been heard,
and not just by me.

232
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:13,687
When you walked into...

233
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:20,629
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

234
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,929
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

235
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:26,771
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

236
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,351
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

237
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,211
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

238
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:37,393
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

239
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:42,083
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

240
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:43,893
I didn't write it, okay?

241
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:48,695
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

242
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:53,306
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

243
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,537
I'm just busting on you.

244
00:23:57,747 --> 00:24:02,878
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

245
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:05,420
With tomatoes.

246
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,619
Thanks, man.

247
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:11,560
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

248
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,731
- Yeah.
- No problem.

249
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:24,113
Jamie.

250
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,174
What do you want?

251
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:32,114
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

252
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,826
I need help with my lines.

253
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:41,526
- Landon Carter's asking me for help?
- Yeah.

254
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:44,538
Okay, I'll pray for you.

255
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:46,738
Jamie, look-

256
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:51,279
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

257
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:56,420
A request like yours requires
flattery and groveling.

258
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,111
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

259
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:05,132
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

260
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:10,063
- Please?
- Okay. One condition, though.

261
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:11,934
What's that?

262
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:15,545
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

263
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:24,247
- That's not a problem.
- Okay. I'll see you today after school.

264
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,557
Landon Carter is coming here?

265
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,999
He's dangerous, careless,
the worst kind of bully.

266
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,140
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

267
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,860
I thought we had discussed
that I would decide...

268
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,101
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

269
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,542
It's him I don't trust, not you.

270
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:02,796
You gonna keep me out here
all afternoon?

271
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:04,966
Come on in.

272
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:14,378
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

273
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:16,578
Oh, yeah.

274
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,978
It's not likely.

275
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,843
That is one scary-looking-

276
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:42,844
- Jesus!
- No, Jamie's father.

277
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:47,855
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

278
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:49,786
Congratulations.

279
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:52,966
Thanks for letting me
come over and run lines.

280
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,257
I didn't let you.

281
00:26:56,067 --> 00:27:01,239
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

282
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:07,139
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

283
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,340
But I see you.

284
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:16,291
I'll be in my office, just here.

285
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:17,451
Ready?

286
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:21,393
Yeah, let's go.

287
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:30,435
- Landon! Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

288
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:33,446
- Hey, come here.
- What's up?

289
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:36,977
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, sure.

290
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,041
What the hell?

291
00:28:12,864 --> 00:28:16,425
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

292
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:20,326
Do you normally walk alone
in a cemetery at night?

293
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:21,967
Maybe.

294
00:28:22,677 --> 00:28:24,696
Where you going?

295
00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:27,747
Come and see.

296
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:36,679
Okay. What is that?

297
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:41,621
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 12.

298
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,721
Take a look.

299
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:52,473
Saturn. Very cool.

300
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:57,944
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

301
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:02,015
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

302
00:29:02,225 --> 00:29:05,986
Nature's miracles. I get it.

303
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:10,028
- Get what?
- That you're into all this stuff.

304
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:12,757
This stuff?

305
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:17,338
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

306
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:21,100
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

307
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,770
Without suffering,
there's no compassion.

308
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,640
Tell that to those who suffer.

309
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:33,663
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

310
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:37,362
- She's trashy.
- Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

311
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,394
Here comes your leading lady.

312
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:44,635
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

313
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:47,675
In your dreams.

314
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,688
Hi. Where's your sweater?

315
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,800
Let's get out of here.

316
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,871
What's up, dude?

317
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:45,577
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

318
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:49,509
What do you want?

319
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:53,490
- You're not in a good mood.
- You don't miss a thing.

320
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,691
Listen, I was hoping
we could run lines together.

321
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:01,062
Okay, but just not
so anybody knows, right?

322
00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:05,904
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

323
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:07,904
We could be secret friends.

324
00:31:08,114 --> 00:31:11,874
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

325
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:15,516
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

326
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:22,916
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

327
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:28,328
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

328
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:31,039
But I was very wrong.

329
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,240
Damn it!

330
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,692
Sorry. Sorry.

331
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,531
You know the answer?

332
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:29,372
Come on, man, I know you know.

333
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:40,344
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

334
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:43,114
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

335
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:45,915
Take a step towards the basket.

336
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,056
Am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

337
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:54,068
- Yeah.
- Are you?

338
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:57,898
- Yeah.
- So, what did we just make?

339
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:05,440
- A similar triangle?
- Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

340
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,720
You got it, two sides the same.

341
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,652
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

342
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,021
I came to say I'm sorry.

343
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:33,553
Well, you did. Feel better?

344
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,963
No. I feel like shit.

345
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:41,134
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

346
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:48,346
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

347
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:53,187
I made that jump once.

348
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:56,247
I thought I was a badass.

349
00:35:57,528 --> 00:36:02,659
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly flop.

350
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:06,830
Did it hurt?

351
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:11,442
Like hell.

352
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:14,211
Good.

353
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:25,224
So I guess I'll see
you at school then.

354
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,076
- Pour me a drink, Joey.
- You promised me, Tommy.

355
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:36,437
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

356
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:39,047
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

357
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:43,018
I won't sit on my keister
and watch the fat cats get rich.

358
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:46,159
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

359
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:49,220
That's it! We are through!

360
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:52,390
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

361
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,331
And I hope you drown in it!

362
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:59,162
So you must be the new girl
he's hired.

363
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:02,102
The singer?

364
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:07,113
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

365
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:10,755
He's nothing but trouble
in cheap spats.

366
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:16,515
Look, I ain't blaming you.

367
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:19,457
I ain't asking for forgiveness,
either.

368
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,797
I just did what I had to.

369
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:33,079
When you walked out of the rain
and into my club...

370
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,909
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

371
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,281
Nothing's coincidence.

372
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:43,982
Your face... You look so familiar.

373
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:48,893
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

374
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,623
Tell me about this dream girl.

375
00:37:56,504 --> 00:38:00,465
Well, I don't remember.

376
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,616
All I know...

377
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:12,988
...is you're beautiful.

378
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,860
The song, the song.

379
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,311
The dream.

380
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:30,342
Help me to remember.

381
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:33,673
Will you sing for me?

382
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:40,748
That was great.

383
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:47,519
Hi, kids.

384
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:52,101
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

385
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:53,891
Thanks, but please stop.

386
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,601
- Don't be home too late.
- Okay. Thanks.

387
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:59,042
Okay, okay.

388
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:03,574
- Interesting rewrite you did there.
- I did my best.

389
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:06,183
Your acting didn't suck either.

390
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,984
- Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
- Okay.

391
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:13,456
- Landon, you were marvelous!
- Thank you.

392
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,327
Landon? Fine performance, son.

393
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:24,408
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd get a bite.

394
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:26,808
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't walk away.

395
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:28,779
You taught me how.

396
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:39,752
Oh, my God.

397
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:42,252
Look who's here.

398
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,703
Don't look at him.

399
00:43:48,903 --> 00:43:51,464
You don't want to stare too much.

400
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,584
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

401
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:13,889
- People can see.
- That would ruin your reputation how?

402
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:15,589
What's that?

403
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:22,071
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

404
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:26,772
- And how many books are there?
- A hundred.

405
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:31,823
But then there's his British list
and his European list.

406
00:44:32,023 --> 00:44:36,324
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

407
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:47,036
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

408
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:48,937
Maybe...

409
00:44:50,548 --> 00:44:54,207
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

410
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:59,259
- Maybe you inspire me.
- Sounds like bull.

411
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:01,150
- Which part?
- All of it.

412
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,259
- It's not.
- Prove it.

413
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:14,032
Jamie!

414
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:18,983
- You've no idea how to be a friend.
- I don't just want that.

415
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:23,314
- You don't know what you want.
- You're scared someone wants you.

416
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:27,825
- Why would that scare me?
- You couldn't hide behind books...

417
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,826
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

418
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:35,267
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

419
00:45:35,437 --> 00:45:38,267
It's because you want
to be with me too.

420
00:45:58,863 --> 00:46:01,892
We gonna get this party jumping!

421
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:06,073
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

422
00:46:06,273 --> 00:46:09,675
You really know how
to bust a robot's groove.

423
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:14,505
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

424
00:46:14,715 --> 00:46:17,376
What we got here?

425
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:22,788
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

426
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:25,627
Jamie lent it to me.

427
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:28,429
You're listening
to her people's music.

428
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:30,229
- Her people?
- Yeah...

429
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:34,870
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

430
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,911
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

431
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:40,011
- She's not like that.
- Well...

432
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:43,982
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

433
00:46:44,182 --> 00:46:47,024
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

434
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:58,396
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

435
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:02,696
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

436
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,538
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same shit all the time.

437
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:10,979
This girl's changed you,
and you don't even know it, man.

438
00:47:11,189 --> 00:47:14,878
- Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
- No.

439
00:47:15,189 --> 00:47:16,850
I did.

440
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:30,132
You.

441
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:32,643
Me.

442
00:47:37,214 --> 00:47:38,844
What is it?

443
00:47:39,054 --> 00:47:41,285
I got you something.

444
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:46,897
Thank you.

445
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:53,097
Well, I'll see you at school.

446
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,399
Okay.

447
00:48:04,621 --> 00:48:08,051
- Mr. Carter.
- Later, Reverend.

448
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,436
Boys like that...

449
00:48:34,487 --> 00:48:36,417
...they have...

450
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,830
They have expectations.

451
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:47,629
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

452
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,810
Fine.

453
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,942
You might not care
what I say or think...

454
00:48:57,152 --> 00:49:00,142
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

455
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,924
I think he wants me to be happy.

456
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:10,584
Dad, it's just a sweater.

457
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:13,696
I'm going to make us
some dinner, okay?

458
00:49:25,148 --> 00:49:27,619
I talked to your dad today.

459
00:49:27,819 --> 00:49:32,651
Said he saw you at the play
for about 10 seconds.

460
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:37,231
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

461
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:44,063
- Landon, there are a lot of reasons-
- He left us.

462
00:49:45,242 --> 00:49:47,833
You need to forgive him too.

463
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:57,615
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

464
00:49:57,825 --> 00:50:01,516
She was looking all right
in that play.

465
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:03,097
She doesn't look hot.

466
00:50:03,297 --> 00:50:08,567
Yeah, I would have to say during
the play, she looked hot.

467
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,638
I have the best idea.

468
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:15,069
Can you do something, like, move it?

469
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,380
Maybe move it around
a little something here.

470
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,610
Take one.

471
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:27,112
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

472
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:32,123
Hey, look at this.

473
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,193
Here.

474
00:50:35,204 --> 00:50:37,534
Take one. Look.

475
00:50:42,176 --> 00:50:45,576
- Jamie. Hi.
- Hi.

476
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:50,147
Listen, I just want you to know,
no hard feelings.

477
00:50:50,357 --> 00:50:53,518
Landon and I are way over.

478
00:50:53,728 --> 00:50:57,018
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

479
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,930
You'd be so beautiful...

480
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,001
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

481
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:10,942
- Come on, eat lunch with me.
- Okay.

482
00:51:11,142 --> 00:51:13,132
- Want a Tic Tac?
- No, thanks.

483
00:51:13,343 --> 00:51:14,833
Okay.

484
00:51:26,565 --> 00:51:28,226
Wow.

485
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:30,906
Is that you?

486
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:38,708
Nice bod.

487
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:11,546
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

488
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:13,746
Stay here.

489
00:52:17,497 --> 00:52:20,827
Hey, man, no wonder you been
keeping her locked up.

490
00:52:21,027 --> 00:52:24,298
I had no idea this was
underneath all that.

491
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,070
- Dean, stop!
- You stay out of this!

492
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:40,993
- We're through. We're through.
- That's great.

493
00:52:41,153 --> 00:52:43,312
- We're through forever!
- You okay?

494
00:52:43,562 --> 00:52:46,083
- You made a mistake, Landon!
- You sure?

495
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:48,054
Let's get out of here.

496
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:50,735
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

497
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:56,035
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

498
00:52:56,235 --> 00:52:59,476
They're animals, all right?

499
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,047
You want me to take you home?

500
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:05,947
Let's get out of here.

501
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:11,849
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

502
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:17,129
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

503
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:27,273
- I want to ask you something.
- Okay.

504
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:36,054
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

505
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:41,925
I'm sorry. I can't go.

506
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:49,108
- You have something else going on?
- No.

507
00:53:49,308 --> 00:53:53,568
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

508
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,950
I'm not allowed to date.

509
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:11,252
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

510
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:18,134
Whatever a man sows,
that he will also reap.

511
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:23,105
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap-"

512
00:54:23,315 --> 00:54:26,146
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:54:26,316 --> 00:54:30,086
I'd like to ask your daughter
to dinner on Saturday night.

514
00:54:30,356 --> 00:54:32,487
That's not possible.

515
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:40,358
With all due respect, sir,
I ask you to reconsider.

516
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:45,009
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

517
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:50,810
You can exit the way you entered.

518
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:59,123
I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

519
00:54:59,323 --> 00:55:01,984
She deserves more than that.

520
00:55:02,823 --> 00:55:05,524
I'm asking you for the same thing...

521
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:08,965
...you teach us every day in church.

522
00:55:10,635 --> 00:55:12,626
And that's faith.

523
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,848
I can't believe you asked permission.

524
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,079
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

525
00:55:25,259 --> 00:55:27,119
- Thank you.
- This is for you.

526
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:31,060
- Thank you very much.
- Would you like something to drink?

527
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,530
- Sweet tea, please.
- Make that two.

528
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,462
Right away.

529
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:41,102
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

530
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:44,142
- Don't even worry about it, okay?
- Okay.

531
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:46,644
Choose whatever you want.

532
00:55:47,354 --> 00:55:49,974
So, what'll it be?

533
00:55:50,954 --> 00:55:53,184
Is everything okay?

534
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:57,486
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, me too. Thanks.

535
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:06,568
Would you like to dance?

536
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:11,509
Sorry, I don't dance.

537
00:56:11,709 --> 00:56:15,480
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

538
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:21,481
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

539
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:24,453
Everybody can dance.

540
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:27,462
Come on, you can't be that bad.

541
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,533
Please?

542
00:56:31,173 --> 00:56:32,833
For me?

543
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:35,835
Come on.

544
00:56:50,357 --> 00:56:54,919
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

545
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:59,370
- In all fairness, you warned me, right?
- That's right.

546
00:57:03,741 --> 00:57:07,041
So, what's number one on your list?

547
00:57:09,212 --> 00:57:11,651
Okay.

548
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:16,343
Number one on my list
is getting out of Beaufort.

549
00:57:17,994 --> 00:57:20,514
Getting out won't be your problem.

550
00:57:20,734 --> 00:57:25,295
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

551
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:27,436
What do you mean?

552
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:32,278
I mean, you can do anything.

553
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,432
- Where are we going?
- Just hold on, you'll see.

554
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,262
Come on, come on. Let's go!

555
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:03,244
- What are we doing?
- Run!

556
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:06,715
- Okay, okay. Stand there.
- All right.

557
00:58:06,915 --> 00:58:10,855
- One foot there, and one foot here.
- Okay.

558
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,927
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

559
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:19,397
Right now, you're straddling
the state line.

560
00:58:21,069 --> 00:58:22,798
Okay.

561
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:28,139
You're in two places at once.

562
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:44,724
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

563
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:46,923
You choose.

564
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:51,635
- Butterfly.
- Okay.

565
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:58,775
Where do you want it?

566
00:59:02,157 --> 00:59:04,018
Right here.

567
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:13,530
Okay.

568
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:24,215
How can you see places like this...

569
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:29,257
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

570
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:33,757
You're lucky to be so sure.

571
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:40,539
It's like the wind.

572
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:45,810
I can't see it, but I feel it.

573
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,111
What do you feel?

574
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:55,512
I feel wonder and beauty...

575
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:59,493
...joy, love.

576
01:01:00,964 --> 01:01:04,694
I mean, it's the center of everything.

577
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:10,506
I might kiss you.

578
01:01:12,846 --> 01:01:15,147
I might be bad at it.

579
01:01:18,557 --> 01:01:21,018
That's not possible.

580
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:47,514
I love you.

581
01:02:00,507 --> 01:02:04,948
Now would be the time
to say something.

582
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:11,009
I told you not to fall in love with me.

583
01:03:18,264 --> 01:03:22,495
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

584
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,267
Landon, go home. The night's over.

585
01:03:27,477 --> 01:03:29,176
- Good night.
- Good night.

586
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:31,277
Good night, sir.

587
01:03:34,758 --> 01:03:38,189
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

588
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:44,089
- You act with that boy like you're-
- In love?

589
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,601
- Jamie, you are a child.
- Dad, look at me...

590
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:52,401
- ...I'm not a child.
- Then stop acting childish.

591
01:03:56,113 --> 01:03:57,983
I love him.

592
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:05,155
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

593
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:29,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,222
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

595
01:04:34,432 --> 01:04:37,362
So, what did you tell your father?

596
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:41,522
The truth. I just left you out of it.

597
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:44,794
So, what do you want to see?

598
01:04:45,644 --> 01:04:47,234
Pluto.

599
01:04:47,504 --> 01:04:50,964
Pluto only rises a few minutes
before the sun.

600
01:04:51,184 --> 01:04:53,015
Right...

601
01:04:54,086 --> 01:04:58,247
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

602
01:05:00,857 --> 01:05:03,158
...and a blanket.

603
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:07,198
- You planned this.
- Oh, I hoped for it.

604
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,559
Are you trying to seduce me?

605
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:14,970
Why? Are you seducible?

606
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,141
That's what I thought...

607
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:23,013
...ergo, a second blanket.

608
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:27,213
- One for me, and one for you.
- Thank you.

609
01:05:39,075 --> 01:05:44,277
- Can you find this star right here?
- Sure.

610
01:05:54,189 --> 01:05:57,750
So why am I looking for this star?

611
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,461
Because I had it named for you.

612
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:05,301
See?

613
01:06:06,102 --> 01:06:07,972
It's official.

614
01:06:08,572 --> 01:06:13,013
It's from the International
Star Registry.

615
01:06:16,584 --> 01:06:18,814
This is wonderful!

616
01:06:23,726 --> 01:06:25,786
I love you.

617
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:42,670
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

618
01:06:51,432 --> 01:06:55,263
So, what's your number one?

619
01:06:59,403 --> 01:07:03,064
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

620
01:07:03,274 --> 01:07:06,105
That's where my parents were married.

621
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:39,183
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

622
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:42,783
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

623
01:07:42,994 --> 01:07:44,684
Sorry.

624
01:07:45,464 --> 01:07:49,825
Landon, were you with Jamie?

625
01:07:50,035 --> 01:07:53,396
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

626
01:07:53,606 --> 01:07:56,076
- Mom-
- Please!

627
01:07:56,436 --> 01:07:58,336
It's different with her.

628
01:07:58,646 --> 01:08:02,007
- It's different with her.
- Yes.

629
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:07,079
It better be different with her.

630
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:14,220
I was doing laundry the other day,
and I found this.

631
01:08:22,002 --> 01:08:24,942
"Examine a moon rock.

632
01:08:26,242 --> 01:08:28,474
Go to college.

633
01:08:29,144 --> 01:08:32,375
Get into medical school."

634
01:08:36,124 --> 01:08:42,427
Honey, these are really
beautiful ambitions.

635
01:08:42,627 --> 01:08:49,128
- But you'll have to work really hard.
- I can do that.

636
01:08:52,209 --> 01:08:53,969
Yeah, you can.

637
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,681
Mama...

638
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:04,511
...Jamie has faith in me.

639
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:07,653
You know?

640
01:09:08,362 --> 01:09:12,563
She makes me want to be different.

641
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:15,434
Better.

642
01:09:16,634 --> 01:09:20,545
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

643
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:29,548
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

644
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:35,618
Are you worried
about your college applications?

645
01:09:35,828 --> 01:09:37,259
No.

646
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,990
I'm not applying.

647
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,999
- I thought you said-
- No, you assumed.

648
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,611
- Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
- No.

649
01:09:50,542 --> 01:09:52,842
What are you gonna do?

650
01:09:56,283 --> 01:09:58,183
I'm sick.

651
01:09:58,393 --> 01:10:02,084
- I'll take you home, you'll be-
- No, Landon!

652
01:10:02,924 --> 01:10:04,395
I'm sick.

653
01:10:08,366 --> 01:10:10,856
I have leukemia.

654
01:10:16,348 --> 01:10:17,868
No.

655
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,508
- You're 18, you're perfect.
- No.

656
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:26,350
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

657
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,531
So why didn't you tell me?

658
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:38,063
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

659
01:10:38,273 --> 01:10:41,643
I didn't want anybody
to be weird around me.

660
01:10:41,813 --> 01:10:45,103
- Including me?
- Especially you!

661
01:10:48,085 --> 01:10:53,116
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

662
01:10:57,457 --> 01:11:01,798
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

663
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:12,873
Dad, open the door!

664
01:12:23,236 --> 01:12:24,727
Landon?

665
01:12:26,267 --> 01:12:29,207
- I need your help.
- What's wrong? You okay?

666
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:32,867
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's...

667
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:39,949
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

668
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:41,879
Okay, calm down.

669
01:12:42,059 --> 01:12:45,621
- Can you help me or not?
- I don't know her case.

670
01:12:45,831 --> 01:12:49,922
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't-

671
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:54,663
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

672
01:12:54,873 --> 01:12:58,244
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

673
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:38,825
Your mom called me.

674
01:14:39,895 --> 01:14:42,237
Talk to me, man.

675
01:14:42,467 --> 01:14:44,627
About what?

676
01:14:46,938 --> 01:14:48,808
About you...

677
01:14:49,008 --> 01:14:51,109
...about Jamie.

678
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:57,010
What's there to talk about?

679
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,951
She's the best person I've ever known.

680
01:15:06,232 --> 01:15:08,892
I didn't understand.

681
01:15:14,144 --> 01:15:16,404
It's okay, man.

682
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,786
It's okay.

683
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:46,811
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

684
01:15:49,722 --> 01:15:52,122
I'm not going anywhere.

685
01:15:52,452 --> 01:15:54,943
Please tell Jamie that.

686
01:16:24,259 --> 01:16:29,491
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

687
01:16:29,701 --> 01:16:31,792
I made you do too many things-

688
01:16:32,002 --> 01:16:35,201
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

689
01:16:44,384 --> 01:16:46,754
Are you scared?

690
01:16:47,825 --> 01:16:49,315
To death.

691
01:16:52,766 --> 01:16:54,626
Lighten up.

692
01:16:54,826 --> 01:16:57,097
It's not funny.

693
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:21,393
I'm scared of not being with you.

694
01:17:25,133 --> 01:17:28,124
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

695
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,116
I'll be here.

696
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:43,587
Mom.

697
01:17:46,097 --> 01:17:48,218
Can you do me a favor?

698
01:19:20,638 --> 01:19:22,979
So I talked to Eric.

699
01:19:29,651 --> 01:19:32,281
Need some help with this stuff?

700
01:19:32,821 --> 01:19:34,352
Sure.

701
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:14,632
What's that boy doing in the yard?

702
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:20,672
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

703
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:31,197
Landon. Run along, son.

704
01:21:31,397 --> 01:21:33,669
I'm not tired.

705
01:21:35,139 --> 01:21:38,110
I need just a minute with her.

706
01:21:46,121 --> 01:21:49,922
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

707
01:22:13,758 --> 01:22:15,717
Daddy...

708
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:19,288
...so serious.

709
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:35,333
Do you remember
when you were about 5 or 6...

710
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:38,813
...and you said you hated gravity...

711
01:22:39,023 --> 01:22:42,424
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

712
01:22:44,724 --> 01:22:49,355
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

713
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:54,967
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

714
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:57,797
Dad...

715
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:06,379
You know, when I lost your mother...

716
01:23:11,391 --> 01:23:15,691
...I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

717
01:23:23,673 --> 01:23:27,203
Jamie, I couldn't look
at you for days.

718
01:23:32,685 --> 01:23:34,616
But then...

719
01:23:39,057 --> 01:23:42,387
I love you so much.

720
01:24:09,934 --> 01:24:12,495
I wanted to give you these.

721
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:15,664
The pictures from the play.

722
01:24:21,946 --> 01:24:25,306
- I'm sorry about the flyers.
- It doesn't matter.

723
01:24:29,118 --> 01:24:32,279
I guess you're with who you should be.

724
01:24:33,629 --> 01:24:35,819
It's like she chose you.

725
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:40,460
Yeah, I don't even know why.

726
01:24:43,201 --> 01:24:45,171
I do.

727
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,951
How you feeling?

728
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:30,752
- I'm okay. How are you?
- Pretty good.

729
01:25:30,962 --> 01:25:33,992
- I have something for you.
- You do?

730
01:25:39,273 --> 01:25:42,534
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

731
01:25:42,914 --> 01:25:48,345
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

732
01:25:49,616 --> 01:25:53,216
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

733
01:25:55,127 --> 01:25:59,428
- Come on.
- Okay, let's check it out.

734
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:09,201
"What is a friend?

735
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:14,901
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

736
01:26:15,782 --> 01:26:18,683
- Right here.
- Okay.

737
01:26:19,323 --> 01:26:21,813
"Find out who you are...

738
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:24,923
...and do it on purpose."

739
01:26:26,034 --> 01:26:27,894
That's Dolly Parton.

740
01:26:29,405 --> 01:26:32,065
I always thought she was smart.

741
01:26:42,047 --> 01:26:47,959
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

742
01:26:48,589 --> 01:26:52,390
Love is never boastful or conceited.

743
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,361
It is never rude or selfish.

744
01:26:56,571 --> 01:27:01,701
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

745
01:27:10,553 --> 01:27:13,854
- You know what I figured out today?
- What?

746
01:27:17,756 --> 01:27:20,456
Maybe God...

747
01:27:21,225 --> 01:27:25,997
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

748
01:27:27,368 --> 01:27:32,039
Like, this journey never ends.

749
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:38,180
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick.

750
01:27:41,251 --> 01:27:44,192
To help me through all this.

751
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:57,844
You're my angel.

752
01:28:15,599 --> 01:28:16,889
What's going on?

753
01:28:17,099 --> 01:28:21,969
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

754
01:28:22,169 --> 01:28:26,071
- What does she mean?
- He's been trying to reach you.

755
01:28:26,281 --> 01:28:29,902
He's going to pay
for private home care.

756
01:28:59,488 --> 01:29:01,348
Thank you.

757
01:29:21,342 --> 01:29:23,334
Sorry.

758
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:28,315
It's all right, son.

759
01:30:04,533 --> 01:30:09,903
- I gotta finish this tonight.
- Here, something hot.

760
01:30:12,275 --> 01:30:15,295
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

761
01:30:15,505 --> 01:30:18,105
- Yeah, they're in here.
- Good.

762
01:30:18,315 --> 01:30:22,277
- What about side bearings?
- An old phonographic turntable.

763
01:30:22,487 --> 01:30:26,218
So you think you can get
all this done by tomorrow?

764
01:30:28,358 --> 01:30:31,519
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

765
01:30:31,829 --> 01:30:33,889
It's beautiful.

766
01:30:34,099 --> 01:30:36,970
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

767
01:31:17,418 --> 01:31:18,778
There it is.

768
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:25,091
Come here. Come look.

769
01:31:27,161 --> 01:31:30,062
Come here. Come look, quick.

770
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:41,604
That is cool.

771
01:31:51,427 --> 01:31:52,946
Do you love me?

772
01:32:00,409 --> 01:32:05,169
- Will you do something for me then?
- Anything.

773
01:32:08,211 --> 01:32:10,701
Will you marry me?

774
01:33:34,919 --> 01:33:41,291
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

775
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:46,733
- I love you.
- "Love is never boastful nor conceited.

776
01:33:46,933 --> 01:33:49,462
It is never rude or selfish.

777
01:33:49,673 --> 01:33:54,504
It does not take offense
and is not resentful.

778
01:33:54,714 --> 01:33:59,085
Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins...

779
01:33:59,286 --> 01:34:03,215
...but delights in the truth.

780
01:34:03,425 --> 01:34:08,797
It is always ready to excuse,
to trust, to hope...

781
01:34:08,998 --> 01:34:11,558
...and to endure...

782
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,028
...whatever comes."

783
01:34:15,839 --> 01:34:20,210
- I, Landon Rollins Carter...
- I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

784
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,770
...do solemnly swear...

785
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:27,111
- ...to take Jamie Sullivan...
- ...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

786
01:34:27,321 --> 01:34:29,482
- ...as my wife.
- ...as my husband.

787
01:34:29,682 --> 01:34:35,654
To honor and to cherish her,
all the days of my life.

788
01:34:55,418 --> 01:34:59,119
Jamie and I had a perfect
summer together...

789
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:04,089
... with more love than lots ofpeople
know in a lifetime.

790
01:35:04,299 --> 01:35:08,821
And then she went,
with her unfailing faith.

791
01:35:31,365 --> 01:35:33,957
It's been four years...

792
01:35:35,066 --> 01:35:38,767
...but the vision ofJamie
walking towards me...

793
01:35:40,077 --> 01:35:43,008
... will stay with me forever.

794
01:35:44,549 --> 01:35:47,519
Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

795
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:57,552
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

796
01:36:04,673 --> 01:36:06,224
Landon.

797
01:36:10,214 --> 01:36:12,945
- You look good.
- Thank you. You too.

798
01:36:13,145 --> 01:36:15,306
I'm getting by.

799
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:31,399
- What's new, Landon?
- Well, I got into medical school.

800
01:36:31,599 --> 01:36:33,759
Your mother told me that.

801
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:39,601
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

802
01:36:42,282 --> 01:36:44,313
Listen.

803
01:36:49,893 --> 01:36:54,595
I want you to have this.

804
01:36:55,065 --> 01:36:57,364
Oh, Landon.

805
01:37:03,406 --> 01:37:05,397
Oh, my.

806
01:37:08,347 --> 01:37:09,367
Thank you.

807
01:37:13,989 --> 01:37:17,249
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

808
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:23,851
She did.

809
01:37:26,071 --> 01:37:28,062
It was you.

810
01:37:36,983 --> 01:37:40,044
Jamie saved my life.

811
01:37:40,684 --> 01:37:43,556
She taught me everything.

812
01:37:43,926 --> 01:37:47,296
About life, hope...

813
01:37:47,496 --> 01:37:50,226
...and the longjourney ahead.

814
01:37:51,637 --> 01:37:54,038
I'll always miss her.

815
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:59,608
But our love is like the wind.

816
01:38:01,379 --> 01:38:03,810
I can't see it...

817
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:06,480
...but I can feel it.

818
