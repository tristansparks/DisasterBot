1
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:26,773
That's Laura's car.

2
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,212
- Laura!
- You lost?

3
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,977
- Hi, sweetie!
- Yeah. How do I get back to New York?

4
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,952
- Hey. Still driving the booger.
- Don't move. I'm getting in.

5
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:38,454
- Nice car, sweetie.
- Sweetheart...

6
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,388
- Trip... no, no.
- It's OK, I got it.

7
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,893
I got it, I got it.

8
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,130
Don't fall!

9
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,596
Hi, mama!

10
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,798
Oh, my God!
Had to get out of there.

11
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,101
Desperate situation.
All right. Truth.

12
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,670
Have I gotten obese?
Tell me the truth.

13
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,044
- Are we gonna start that already?
- Just tell me the truth.

14
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,846
- You can't lie for shit.
- You look revolting, head to toe.

15
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,683
Good. 'Cause you've never
looked worse in your life.

16
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,852
Oh, babe.

17
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,425
Trip.

18
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,128
You always know what to say.

19
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,832
I think this occasion
calls for a drink.

20
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,968
Yeah. Yeah, a couple.

21
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,499
- Go. Go.
- Wanna race?

22
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,701
I'll race you.

23
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,111
Tom, man.
The guy just keeps winning.

24
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,279
Honey, you didn't do so bad.

25
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,415
Sweetie... Sweetie, the day we met
was the best day of my life.

26
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,959
It was nighttime, honey.

27
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:53,498
It was 2:00am, September 20th, 1999
is what it was.

28
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,032
I believe we were
at the Yankee Doodle.

29
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,634
And I asked if I could
borrow your ketchup.

30
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,566
And I saw that you already
had a bottle on your table.

31
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,229
I know. It was a bold-faced lie,
but I was desperate to meet you.

32
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,467
When are you ladies
gonna get married already?

33
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,009
- October?
- May... be October.

34
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,446
Maybe October.

35
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,866
- You're here!
- We're here!

36
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,929
Finally!

37
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,037
How's my hair?

38
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,160
- Revolting.
- Makeup?

39
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,533
- Trashy.
- Clothes?

40
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,005
Tacky choice.

41
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,174
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

42
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,511
All right, all right, all right,
we'll have enough time tonight

43
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,712
to kiss your butt
at the rehearsal dinner.

44
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,220
- Lo.
- Li.

45
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,120
- Weez.
- Trip.

46
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,048
Lila.

47
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,017
Lila.

48
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,222
Lila Hayes is...

49
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,655
...not my friend.

50
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,967
Lila Hayes is my sister.

51
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,779
Lila and I have shared many things:

52
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:34,882
Rooms, clothes,
study notes, boyfriends...

53
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,703
Lila Hayes is...

54
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,273
...the luckiest girl in the world.

55
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,674
She has...

56
00:06:56,448 --> 00:07:01,545
...beauty, intelligence,
a killer backhand,

57
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,213
boobs I would kill for.

58
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,120
She's graced with all of these things.

59
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:14,158
And she's brought us
all here tonight...

60
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,465
...to celebrate...

61
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,506
...her greatest accomplishment...

62
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,704
...love.

63
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,279
Trip, I'm standing right here.

64
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,615
It's perfume.

65
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,246
Can you just try not
to spray it in my nose?

66
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:43,719
I am so screwed for my toast.
I haven't written a thing.

67
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,058
You always say that and
then you give the best one.

68
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,827
You have an unfair advantage,
Miss Published Writer.

69
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,200
But, tonight you've got competition.

70
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,931
Your signature rhyming ode?

71
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,702
Damn right.
Guaranteed to bring down the house.

72
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,472
Nice.

73
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,046
Hey, you OK?

74
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,741
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

75
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,374
Can I borrow?

76
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,180
Yeah, I wonder why people
keep asking you that.

77
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,523
I'm sorry. It was just...

78
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,683
...a really long drive.
- Cut the bullshit, Lo.

79
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,125
When was the last time you saw him?

80
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,128
- Saw who?
- Tom.

81
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,597
When was the last time you saw Tom?

82
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,498
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

83
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,605
- You dated the man for four years.
- Five.

84
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,368
- Five.
- But you guys have stayed close.

85
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,034
Yeah, we are. I mean, we were.

86
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,645
Well, when?

87
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,110
Honestly, I don't remember.

88
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:43,415
- Before he proposed?
- Around then, I guess.

89
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,455
You guess?

90
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:50,891
Fine, it was the day before.

91
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,965
That's sweet.
He called to tell you first?

92
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,396
No.

93
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,229
- But you spoke with him?
- Yeah.

94
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,929
- Trip, just back off.
- So you knew before Lila?

95
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,838
- Actually, he didn't mention it.
- He didn't mention it?

96
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,443
So when did you hear?

97
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:09,479
When Lila called to ask me
to be her maid of honor.

98
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,105
And then?

99
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:14,747
And then... nothing.

100
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,679
Nothing?

101
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,981
No. We haven't spoken since.

102
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,195
Sweetie...

103
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,795
Guys, I'm fine. Really.

104
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:33,769
Really. I couldn't be happier for them.

105
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,737
OK.

106
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:24,879
Thank you.

107
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,357
Let's go, ladies.

108
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,777
- There you are!
- Hey.

109
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:29,445
- Well, are you coming?
- It's just...

110
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:33,149
Well? You know I can't
do this without you.

111
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,226
Of course I'm coming.

112
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,058
OK.

113
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,430
Guys, we all look good.

114
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,100
- Oh, shit! Shit! Look!
- What?

115
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,336
- You know what? I have something...
- Just take them off.

116
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,674
- I can't take them off.
- Yes, you can. Just take them off.

117
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,839
I've got red nail polish.

118
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,416
It might work, it might work...

119
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:02,987
- Let's see...
- You don't even notice it.

120
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,317
It's kind of sexy.
It looks fine. Yeah, yeah.

121
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:06,947
- It's totally fine.
- It looks great.

122
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:08,320
They're just gonna see
your pretty little face.

123
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,018
Oh, and I need to know
if this is funny.

124
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,654
I'm gonna say to Lila,
"It's your last chance to have Pete."

125
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,457
- That's really funny.
- Yeah.

126
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,628
Wow. OK, you guys don't get it.
That's cool.

127
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:22,433
I'll just find something else.
Not a big deal.

128
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,773
- That was amazing.
- Not yet, buddy.

129
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,813
- What's up, dude?
- All right. Ladies and gentlemen,

130
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:32,473
sorry to interrupt,
but cocktails beckon us tonight.

131
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,086
Lila, Tom.
Let's do this quickly, shall we,

132
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,586
so that we can toast
this fantastic pair.

133
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,749
Chip! You nearly took me down.

134
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,259
I knew it.
I still make you weak at the knees.

135
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,455
All right.
We will do one walk-through

136
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,862
- of the wedding procession.
- Nice bow-tie.

137
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,801
Now, members of the wedding party,
I need you to break into pairs.

138
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,534
Husbands will go with wives,
fiances with fiancees...

139
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,837
And Laura, you'll go with Chip.

140
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,873
Flower girls go before Lila,
who will go with her father.

141
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,008
Minnow, you will
lead the processional.

142
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,382
And, Tom, you'll stand
with Reverend Bartlett.

143
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,920
OK.

144
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,115
I'm gonna...
I'll probably just... I'll...

145
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,785
- Everybody got it? Good.
- This whole thing rests on you.

146
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,557
- OK...
- Wait, what's happening?

147
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:23,156
- The whole thing hinges on you.
- Dude, I have no idea what she just...

148
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,394
I don't...

149
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,398
It's kind of intimidating.

150
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:28,369
I think we're at the back.

151
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,468
I believe we go last.

152
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,338
I think you guys should go...

153
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,506
- Tonight's the night.
- And what night is that?

154
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,777
The night you finally fall for me.

155
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,513
- I wouldn't hold your breath.
- Oh, I will.

156
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,523
What happened to all
your little girlfriends?

157
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,321
They're mere bodies,
laying a path to you.

158
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,564
Sorry, guys.

159
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,700
God, it's like a bar mitzvah
in there. Did you see that room?

160
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:39,134
You should just have
a "bring your own bottle..."

161
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,072
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,380
- You look stunning, sweetheart.
- Thank you, Mom.

163
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,351
Now if we could
just find your groom.

164
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,153
- That's funny, isn't it?
- What's funny?

165
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,732
I don't know, just the way
he's standing there like that.

166
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,197
What's funny about it?

167
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,826
OK, maybe funny is the wrong
word, but... strange. It's...

168
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,768
It is a little strange,
don't you think?

169
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,568
What about it is strange?

170
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,645
The way he's staring out to sea
like a lovesick sailor.

171
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,907
- He's a groom. Grooms get nervous.
- Of course.

172
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,812
Mother, please don't.

173
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,214
- You know what I think.
- Yes, I know what you think.

174
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,918
And... perhaps you'll
permit me to say it.

175
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,529
I know you will, regardless.

176
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,460
He has to love you more, Lila.

177
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,933
More than what?

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,839
More than whom?

179
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,043
More than you love him.

180
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,444
That's the only way marriage works.

181
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,981
Leave him alone.

182
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,761
How's Augusta?

183
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:09,298
She'll be fine
after a couple of cocktails.

184
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,926
Tom McDevon is quite a catch.

185
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,725
Summa graduate,
championship swimmer,

186
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,097
PhD candidate in English,

187
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,727
rather easy on the eyes.

188
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:51,041
So let's raise our glasses
to two perfect catches:

189
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,373
Perfect catch, perfect match.

190
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,174
- There goes the bloodline.
- That's enough for you.

191
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,085
When Tommy told me he was
marrying the lovely Lila,

192
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:12,288
I said..."Tommy boy, you're
one lucky son of a bitch!"

193
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,630
And I said, "You know,

194
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:20,966
attraction is a very important
ingredient in any relationship."

195
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,932
Sure, folks can talk all they
want about love and loyalty

196
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:28,705
and all that other shit,
but the important thing is...

197
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,873
if she doesn't
make your wiener hard...

198
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,052
...forget it! Forget it all!

199
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,315
What are you doing?
What are you doing? No, I...

200
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,220
Let's face it.

201
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:43,225
My sister is perfect.

202
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,363
Everyone here knows it.

203
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,527
If you're a chick, you've spent
your life fighting the urge

204
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,195
to kill her in her sleep.

205
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,776
If you're a guy, you've spent your life
trying to sleep with her.

206
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:03,779
- Admit it, Jake. Admit it.
- You admit it.

207
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,509
Don't worry, Weesie,
he never got anywhere.

208
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,349
Mom...

209
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,926
...Dad.

210
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,462
I know it's been hard
to embrace the new in-laws.

211
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,657
But don't worry.

212
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,499
We only have to spend Christmas
and Thanksgiving with them...

213
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,937
...every year for the rest of our lives.

214
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:41,447
Wait... do Irish people

215
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:44,919
celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah?

216
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,087
"The lovely Lila sat on a wall

217
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:57,065
When she saw Tom McDevon,
her heart had a fall

218
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,898
He rode in on his horse
and picked up the pieces

219
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,700
Until that day,
she had felt like feces."

220
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,136
As everybody knows, Tom is
unmatched in the swimming pool.

221
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,114
As everyone also knows,
Tom is unmatched on the tennis court.

222
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,309
But I don't think enough is said

223
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:18,946
about what a truly kind
and generous man Tom really is.

224
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:24,357
Many of you may not know this,
but I was only point two seconds

225
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,296
behind Tom McDevon
in the breast stroke,

226
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,799
our personal favorite stroke.

227
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,438
"Athletic and smart,
kind and charming,

228
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,907
Tom McDevon was
one disarming... dude."

229
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,877
So I was like, "Jake, where's Tom?"
He's like, "I don't know."

230
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,311
And I was like, "Pete, where's Tom?"
He's like, "I don't know."

231
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:48,647
And we were just like...
But nobody knew where he was.

232
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:53,622
And I still maintain that
he put rufies in my Gatorade...

233
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,421
...and touched me
inappropriately under the water.

234
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,254
That was me.

235
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,525
- That was you?
- Such a good story.

236
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,830
I love that one, so...
But, OK, so one more...

237
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,532
Here's to that lucky lady,
here's to Tom.

238
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,335
I love you both, and...

239
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,741
"And should that egg meet
a sperm and turn into a baby,

240
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:18,872
count on me as a sitter.
I will always say, 'maybe'."

241
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,279
Cheers.

242
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,261
Lila...

243
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,868
...is...

244
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:43,507
...graced with beauty and...

245
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,439
...intelligence and...

246
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,073
...determination.

247
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:53,283
Lila and I were roommates in college.

248
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,910
I was from the Midwest,
she was from the East Coast.

249
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,989
My first memory is...

250
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:05,692
...we were both on Old Campus

251
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,096
in line for our college IDs
and freshmen...

252
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,064
And all of a sudden,
this stranger comes up to me and says:

253
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:19,643
"You know we're gonna have these IDs
for the rest of the year, right?"

254
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,305
And, I said, "Yes." And she goes,
"Well, didn't you bring your makeup?"

255
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:29,279
So, when she painted me up
with Lancome's best, I...

256
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,719
I knew we were gonna be...

257
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,320
...good friends.

258
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,455
And, yet, it was touch and go at first,

259
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,502
but we realized that our differences

260
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,469
made us stronger, you know? We...

261
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:56,445
We got the nickname "La-la"
because we loved each other.

262
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,742
And we loved our friends.

263
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:02,319
Our friends got the nickname,
"The Romantics."

264
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,424
Because of our
incestuous dating history.

265
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:16,426
We were just...

266
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,331
...in love with each other.

267
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,735
Because that's what friends do.
They...

268
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,034
...they fall in love with each other.

269
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,134
And...

270
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,875
...then they fall out of love and...

271
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,814
...they fall back in love and
this happens over and over again

272
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,148
for the rest of their lives.

273
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,681
The fact that Tom and Laura...

274
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,625
The fact that...

275
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:56,364
Tom and Lila found each other is...

276
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,073
...exceptional because they're both...

277
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,671
...exceptional people.

278
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:08,445
And I wish them all
of the joy in the world.

279
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:13,383
To their glittering future.

280
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,153
Hear, hear. Glittering future.

281
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,134
Did I seem nervous?

282
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:27,935
No.

283
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,600
No.

284
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:35,269
- You were great.
- You were really... great.

285
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,071
Wait! Lila!

286
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,370
You didn't think you could
escape that easy, did ya?

287
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,275
Come on, Lila,
just stay for one more drink.

288
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,679
No, I need hours,
maybe days of silence.

289
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:14,917
Boring.

290
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,920
But, I'll see you guys
at midnight, right?

291
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,616
Remember?

292
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:22,885
You guys said
you'd come tuck me in?

293
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:24,255
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

294
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,132
- Remind the others, OK?
- OK.

295
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,995
See ya at midnight.

296
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,241
Hey, do you have any of those,
like, tropical umbrellas...

297
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,645
...I can put in?

298
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:48,945
For like a...

299
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,949
Oh, are you kidding me?

300
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,489
It's free, it's open...

301
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,616
- It's open bar.
- Nothing's free.

302
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,794
Hey!

303
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:06,864
Hey, come back here!

304
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,734
Come back here, you kids!

305
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:11,567
Oh, my God!

306
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,423
Movement to go skinny dipping!

307
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,796
- Would you stop it?
- You always do that!

308
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,098
I guarantee he wants to see one more
piece of ass before his wedding day!

309
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,570
I think he got his fill
at the bachelor party!

310
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:52,175
OK, yeah, yeah. That's right.

311
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,177
I spent half the night trying to pull
your ass out of the champagne room.

312
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,077
Yeah, no... Explain that to her!

313
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,047
Tell me right now,
do I need to divorce my husband?

314
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:01,378
- You're a pussy.
- Sadly, no.

315
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,146
No, none of the strippers
would have him.

316
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,914
God knows I tried.

317
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,956
You dirty rat!

318
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,353
Get outta here!

319
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,363
You got my suit all wet!

320
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,227
He can't run for shit!

321
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:17,960
Come on, guys.

322
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:38,377
Hey.

323
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,056
I liked your speech.

324
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,020
- Thank you.
- I did. It was good.

325
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,291
You were a little nervous,
but it was good.

326
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,368
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

327
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:00,443
Look, I'm sorry.

328
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,504
It's OK.
It was necessary.

329
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,644
Yeah, it was for the best.

330
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,851
You know what?

331
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,155
It was easier than
I thought it was gonna be.

332
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,360
Really?

333
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:28,295
Really, because I thought it was...
I thought it was harder than I...

334
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:34,070
It was harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

335
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,341
So you miss me?

336
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,648
Not for a second.

337
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,099
Mom?

338
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,899
It's me.

339
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,736
Hi.

340
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,108
Something wrong?

341
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,573
Just nervous, I guess.

342
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,685
What are you nervous about?

343
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,089
You know... nothing.

344
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,758
Everything.

345
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,328
I'm nervous Mom's gonna
go psycho after the wedding.

346
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,728
You know how she gets
when she finishes a project,

347
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,697
all up in your grill and shit.

348
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,860
"Up in your grill and shit?"

349
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,266
I just don't want the attention,
I guess.

350
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,172
I think you'll be spared.

351
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:47,684
What about you?
Are you nervous?

352
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,882
I'm terrified.

353
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,791
You are?

354
00:29:55,927 --> 00:30:00,728
- Yep. To the bone.
- About what?

355
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,696
I'm not sure...

356
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,232
Tom can...

357
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:07,268
I'm...

358
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,738
I'm not sure Tom...
I'm not sure Tom is...

359
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,900
Not sure Tom is what?

360
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,841
I'm... I'm just not...

361
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,348
...sure.

362
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,445
Does he make you feel beautiful?

363
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,813
Yes.

364
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:30,360
- Does he make you feel safe?
- Most of the time.

365
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,629
- Does he make you feel special?
- Don't be a dork.

366
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:35,754
You know...

367
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,232
...like you're his
most interesting person.

368
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,032
Yes, yes. He does.

369
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,936
You know what?
This is... this is dumb.

370
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,269
Let's just forget it.

371
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,240
OK, OK, OK, OK!

372
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,440
- OK, OK.
- I say we vote on

373
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,414
who had the best toast of the night.

374
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,180
- And I'm gonna say... me.
- No!

375
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:58,583
- What?!
- Me.

376
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,749
Chip won. And Grandpa McDevon
came in second.

377
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:04,827
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

378
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,597
All right, guys. I'm going in.

379
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,257
- Do it! Who's coming with me?
- Yeah!

380
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,800
It's freezing, baby.

381
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,035
- Yeah?
- Go masturbate in your room, Chip.

382
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,141
Oh, come on. Have some respect!
This is our host.

383
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,609
Keep your clothes on. You big slut.

384
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:24,806
Hey, Tom, you didn't
make a speech tonight.

385
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,748
Yeah, dude, you've
been suspiciously quiet.

386
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,911
- Are you scared of Augusta?
- No, I was just having too much fun

387
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,114
watching you guys
make asses of yourself.

388
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,382
Yeah.

389
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,959
Well, how about giving one now?

390
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:38,322
Yeah!

391
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:40,828
- Speech, speech...
- All right.

392
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,296
I'll give you a speech.

393
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,266
All right!
I'll give a speech. OK...

394
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,203
- This better not suck.
- I'm gonna get on my stage over here.

395
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,867
Right here. OK... All right.

396
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,103
You want a speech?
I'll give you a speech.

397
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,543
- Speech!
- Let's hear it!

398
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,205
- All right!
- Make it good!

399
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,680
Don't be boring.

400
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,218
As I gaze at this assembly
of friends and family

401
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:07,188
on this momentous occasion,
only one thing comes to mind...

402
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,092
- We are all so messed up.
- Hey!

403
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,197
- Speak for yourself!
- I'm awesome!

404
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,926
OK, OK, OK...
Let me start this again.

405
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:21,266
We are all so...

406
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,335
...uninspired.

407
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:31,982
Uninspired. We're so blind
to the tiny, beautiful things.

408
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,745
I saw Jake's tiny beautiful thing.

409
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:37,615
No, I'm talking about
the tiny beautiful things

410
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,848
that make life worth living.

411
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,981
Right? Like you, Weesie.

412
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,790
- Weesie?
- The way you were walking across

413
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,864
the grass before the rehearsal.
It was beautiful.

414
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,432
Or how about Chip, after his toast?

415
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,560
The way all the sound just
kind of fell out of the room,

416
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:55,171
and all you could hear
were forks on plates.

417
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,500
It was magical.

418
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,837
Or how about the sound as you're
driving up to the house here.

419
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,517
It's gravel, grass, ocean.

420
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:11,546
It's verse, verse, chorus.

421
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,817
Wordsworth! Shelley! McDevon!

422
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,324
McDevon!

423
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,126
The seven of us are friends.

424
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,825
No, the seven of us are family.

425
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,333
We're everything to each other.

426
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,706
Sister, brothers, mother...

427
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:34,137
...nurse, shrink, opponent, rival.

428
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,338
We share a history,
and we share a goal...

429
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:41,517
...to inspire and to be inspired.

430
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,414
That, my friends, that's imperative.

431
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,650
And without that...

432
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,388
Without that, we got nothing.

433
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:00,058
Slow clap.

434
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,637
- Where's the cane?
- All right!

435
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,330
- The man is drunk!
- Where's the cane?

436
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,736
Where's the gong?

437
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,866
Seriously, you guys,
thank you so much...

438
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,774
Thank you so much for coming.

439
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,177
That's all I got.
Sorry I've been such a freak tonight.

440
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,543
Oh, and by the way...

441
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,056
Where did he go?

442
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,264
- Guys, I'm really worried.
- Why are you worried?

443
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,269
Because he disappeared in the ocean.

444
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,897
He's probably passed out on the lawn,
freaking out about the wedding.

445
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,272
- Cold feet, anyone?
- Yeah?

446
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,538
I think we have a fugitive
on our hands.

447
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,908
Well, why don't we
go look for the guy?

448
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,346
Let's break into pairs,
canvass the neighborhood. Yes?

449
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:27,814
- Yes.
- I love it.

450
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,581
- Jake, I like the way you think.
- Get over here.

451
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,314
- All right.
- All right.

452
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,554
Chip and I have spent a lot
of quality time together.

453
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,685
- Come on.
- I know, I know.

454
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,058
Why don't we mix it up a bit.

455
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,961
We'll switch partners,
like a dinner party.

456
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,863
- A search party dinner party.
- OK.

457
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,232
- Dibs on Jake.
- Yes. You have such good taste.

458
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,703
- I know.
- Fine by me.

459
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,772
Weesie?

460
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,813
Come on, I'm not that bad.

461
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:00,212
- Come on.
- Wait, Lo, Lo, Lo.

462
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,716
We haven't even made the plan yet.

463
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,547
What area should we cover?

464
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:05,416
- Main house.
- We'll cover the main house.

465
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,923
- Perfect...
- Lo! Remember!

466
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,425
Ten of midnight, on the porch!

467
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,462
We promised Lila!

468
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,898
- What?
- It's your lucky night.

469
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:26,572
OK, so, wait. If you were Tom,
where would you be?

470
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,339
Doing my crunches. Yeah?

471
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,574
OK, yeah, but after
you do your crunches.

472
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:35,310
I'd do a thousand, but if I was done...

473
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:37,420
...l'd probably be in Lila's bed.

474
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,251
- Yes?
- You know that's her room, right there.

475
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,451
- Want to take a last shot?
- Me?

476
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,562
Why don't you two lez out again,
how about that?

477
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,027
I would love to.

478
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,126
Yes.

479
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:56,599
I really stepped on a rock, hard.

480
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,466
You stepped on a rock?

481
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,908
- Yes.
- I like it in here. It's warm.

482
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,980
I love it in here.

483
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,709
- So, hey...
- Yeah?

484
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:11,082
- I saw your movie.
- What?

485
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:12,848
Yeah, I saw the torture one.
I saw it.

486
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,890
How? It never even got released.

487
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,356
I know. I downloaded it.

488
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:18,324
I spend a lot of time
on the Internet.

489
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,362
Yeah, I bet you do.

490
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,794
Wow, that is really embarrassing.

491
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,764
I don't think you
should be embarrassed.

492
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,666
I thought you were really good in it.
I... You had a really funny line

493
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,535
about not wanting to die a blond.
That was good.

494
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:32,437
- You did?
- Yeah.

495
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,476
- I came up with that line.
- Really?

496
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:38,411
- That's great.
- Speaking of great lines...

497
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:41,382
- Are you serious?
- Why? What? Yeah.

498
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:43,179
I don't know. Isn't that a little '80s?

499
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,982
Not when you mix it with Wellbutrin.

500
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,557
'Cause Wellbutrin is... Of course.

501
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:49,852
Of course.

502
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:55,088
So we're doing the guesthouse.

503
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,400
Yep.

504
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:05,402
- You trust him, right?
- Who? Jake? Of course.

505
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:09,137
Good.
'Cause I don't trust Tripler one bit.

506
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:16,985
Wow.

507
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,419
Hey, you ever think there was
something odd about the way

508
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,319
Lila and Tom started dating?

509
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:22,925
- The way that they started dating?
- Yeah.

510
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,585
Remember? It was, like,
right after we came up here

511
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:29,290
for that long weekend.
Senior spring, remember?

512
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,698
I mean, don't you think it was
kind of odd? An odd coincidence?

513
00:39:32,836 --> 00:39:35,066
Yeah, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

514
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:37,867
He asked her out like
three days after we got back.

515
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,101
- Three days. Three days.
- Three days, so?

516
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,872
So, never mind
that he was dating Laura.

517
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,412
The girls were roommates.

518
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,345
So then you think that
Tom started dating Lila

519
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:49,213
because he coveted
her parents' fortune?

520
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,481
OK. You just made that sound
like an episode of Dynasty.

521
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,114
- But that's what you're saying, right?
- No.

522
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,124
- I'm just noting the dates.
- You're an idiot.

523
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,728
I'm not an idiot. I'm just saying.

524
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:00,989
You're just saying something
really shitty about our friend.

525
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:04,362
I'm just saying that I think
Lila's lifestyle appealed to Tom

526
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:06,492
just like Lila's perfect tits
appeal to you.

527
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,401
Oh, I'm sure those
appeal to Tom as well.

528
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,283
- He's not here.
- No. Doesn't seem to be.

529
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,886
- Where do you think he is?
- That's a very good question.

530
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,793
That's one I need a drink to consider.

531
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:44,539
This must be really hard for you.

532
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,440
You drive halfway to the North Pole

533
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,070
to watch the love of your life

534
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,682
marry the bane of your existence.

535
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:54,340
And this is how they thank you?

536
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:56,349
Honestly, Chip, I'm not in the mood.

537
00:40:56,486 --> 00:41:01,890
It's ironic. Asking you, of all
people, to convince the groom

538
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,925
to show up for this wedding.

539
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,162
I wish I could
be there for the reunion.

540
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:11,267
"Oh, Tom. I thought you were lost."

541
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:15,030
"Oh, Laura! I was! Until I found you."

542
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:18,573
Aren't you supposed to be wearing
some sort of ankle bracelet now?

543
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,642
That's funny!

544
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:23,678
No, they just made me
do some community service.

545
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,748
Ankle bracelet!

546
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,342
I'm gonna keep going and
see if he overshot the house.

547
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,715
Goodnight!

548
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,388
You're not worried?

549
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:39,586
Not at all. Wedding day jitters
is a universal affliction.

550
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,595
Did you freak out the night before
your wedding?

551
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,224
Yeah. I spent the night
before my wedding in a closet.

552
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,336
Of course, Tripler locked me in it.

553
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,602
- Darn.
- I hope Laura's OK.

554
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,770
- She's fine.
- Chip was kind of a nightmare.

555
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,883
No worse than usual.

556
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,882
And you don't think we should tell Lila?

557
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,418
Why worry her for no reason?

558
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:05,919
God, I could have sworn
I got another bottle.

559
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,455
God.

560
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:19,899
Where are you hiding from me?

561
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,808
Jackpot.

562
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,777
So when's the big date again?

563
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:33,474
We haven't quite figured that out yet.

564
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,847
- You excited?
- Very.

565
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,178
You scared?

566
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,847
No, I figure I know what I'm in for.

567
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,982
We've been together
for almost ten years.

568
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,393
Are we that old?

569
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,622
And besides, if you and Trip
are any indication,

570
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:49,561
married life is bliss.

571
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:53,462
You do have a sense of humor!

572
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:59,737
To your glittering future.

573
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,078
To your glittering future.

574
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,773
- To our glittering futures.
- To our... yeah.

575
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:13,349
To...

576
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:16,421
I'm already regretting this.

577
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,619
You're dancing on the coke.

578
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,821
You can never regret
the dancing. Ever.

579
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:23,125
- All right, how do you wanna dance?
- Show me your dance moves.

580
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,461
- Show me your dance moves.
- All right, well, it's a Kid 'N Play.

581
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:27,832
- Oh, my God!
- And that's the start,

582
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:29,666
- but there's more.
- I can't believe you can do that.

583
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:31,398
- I can do a lot of things.
- Do it again.

584
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:34,009
- I don't wanna do it again because...
- Just do it one more time.

585
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,612
- You won't be as impressed anymore.
- That is so cool.

586
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,146
I really, really loved it.

587
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,547
Hey, hey, hey, Laura!

588
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,031
I should go and let
everyone know that you're OK.

589
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,864
Laura, just come here
for a minute. Just come here.

590
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,969
- We've been really worried about you.
- Please, just...

591
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,170
Don't go.

592
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,879
Nobody knows that I'm out here.

593
00:44:21,758 --> 00:44:22,747
Exactly.

594
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,259
Yeah, nobody knows
that you're out here.

595
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:26,760
What's your point?

596
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,227
I don't... maybe we can
just hang out for a minute.

597
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:36,597
Nobody's gonna know the difference.

598
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,483
Why are you here?

599
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,289
I don't know. Just thought that I would
swim halfway across the bay

600
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,452
at the chance
to be alone with you.

601
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,021
- You're so full of it.
- I'm totally serious.

602
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,832
So, you excited about tomorrow?

603
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,931
Yeah.

604
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:48,575
- What's your song?
- My song?

605
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,442
Your wedding song?
Your first dance at your wedding.

606
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:55,142
I don't know. Lila picked it.

607
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,121
Well, you're gonna have to
dance anyway. You realize this.

608
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,555
- And everyone will be watching.
- Yeah, well, I can hold my own.

609
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:04,125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

610
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,492
- Well, let's see it.
- Well...

611
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:08,893
You...

612
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:12,798
OK.

613
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,266
No.

614
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,673
- No?
- No.

615
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,076
Maybe you should show me.

616
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,116
You're gonna teach me something.

617
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,378
Come on.

618
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,617
So, what do I do?

619
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,829
Try not to step on her feet.

620
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:45,492
Yeah, might annoy Augusta a little bit.

621
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:51,296
And try not to let her lead too much.
You don't want to make it obvious.

622
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,635
OK.

623
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:18,597
I owe you an apology.

624
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:22,094
It's OK, let's not talk about it.

625
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:31,545
So, you...

626
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,078
You forgive me?

627
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,951
I wouldn't push your luck.

628
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,425
You know, a heads up
would've been nice.

629
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:50,126
You know, nothing...
Nothing major, just...

630
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,566
Just a quick email.
You know, "Hey, Laura.

631
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:55,534
I know I saw you last night

632
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,765
and countless others
over the last ten years,

633
00:47:57,907 --> 00:48:00,967
and not excluding the four years
we dated in college

634
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,669
and the year that we got back together

635
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:06,407
to try again and the handful of times
that we've slept together since...

636
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,178
...but you know that
Lila and I are together now.

637
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,983
And though I've struggled
endlessly with this predicament,

638
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,786
I think we both know the inevitable
here, so don't be surprised

639
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:20,054
when she calls and asks you
to be her maid of honor."

640
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:21,458
Or, you know what?

641
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,999
This is another approach:
Less direct, but same effect.

642
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,228
"Hey, Laura.
Great seeing you last night.

643
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,771
Great movie, great meal,
great sex, but the problem is...

644
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,835
...greatness makes me sick.

645
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,670
I'll see you at the wedding."

646
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,211
You know, on the other hand, I mean...

647
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:47,153
Look, ten years of
a loving friendship and...

648
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,451
...sporadic, incredible sex...

649
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,287
...scattered with nights...

650
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:59,769
...so fun, they explain the
evolutionary purpose of talking.

651
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,872
You know, not to mention
the time that we've clocked together.

652
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:08,844
Listening to music.
You know, driving with...

653
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:12,213
...no destination.

654
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,182
I guess this, this...

655
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,914
...beautiful mess is best ended
without notification.

656
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,052
Probably better.

657
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,922
I'm sorry.

658
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:35,034
Don't be. It was a gift.

659
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:38,066
An act of cowardice so complete,

660
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,472
disqualifies a person
from consideration.

661
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,807
I tried to do
what I thought was right, OK?

662
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,513
It's not like I came at this lightly.

663
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:51,086
- Oh, no.
- Laura.

664
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:53,555
You're the one that broke up with me.

665
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,089
Fuck you.

666
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,020
- Laura, we were seniors in college.
- Don't even start.

667
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,221
What did you want to do?

668
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:03,332
Get married at 21?

669
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:05,696
- What is this, 1950?
- No, it isn't.

670
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:07,826
We were too far apart.

671
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,802
I was busy trying
to finish my dissertation,

672
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:11,429
practically living in Widener Library.

673
00:50:11,574 --> 00:50:13,405
You were doing God knows what
in New York City,

674
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:14,942
probably fending off
all your hipster boyfriends.

675
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,012
Oh, yeah. You know,
if you're gonna patronize me,

676
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,445
try to think of something
a little more original.

677
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,879
- We gave it a college try.
- Yeah, we did.

678
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,214
It was an accident of timing.

679
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,222
What? Let me guess.
Your proposal was an accident, too?

680
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,620
You got the wrong woman?

681
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,283
- Give me a freaking break.
- You know what?

682
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,055
What difference does it make?

683
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:35,492
Just stop talking.

684
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,692
Yeah, you know, I think that
would be a really good idea.

685
00:50:39,502 --> 00:50:42,027
Come here. Listen to me.

686
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,199
I was a lifeguard in high school,
you remember that?

687
00:50:47,343 --> 00:50:49,504
- Yeah, I remember.
- It was my favorite summer job.

688
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,011
You and every other guy in America.

689
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:53,047
I would sit in that chair itching,

690
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,708
itching to get out,
dying to get into the water.

691
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,116
And after eight hours,
my shift would end,

692
00:50:58,254 --> 00:50:59,516
and I would make a break for it,

693
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,591
but as soon as I got into the water,
the strangest thing happened.

694
00:51:03,993 --> 00:51:05,290
I would start to panic.

695
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:07,293
Ambivalence is a disease, you know.

696
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,058
- An actual mental illness.
- That's not funny.

697
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,430
Let me guess. When you were a kid,
you would order chocolate ice cream,

698
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,161
then immediately wished
you'd gotten vanilla?

699
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:15,635
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- No, I get it.

700
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:20,106
- You're torn between two women.
- What I'm trying to say is...

701
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,315
I'm afraid of the ocean.

702
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,655
I'll remember that the next time I...

703
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,960
...I swim on your clock.

704
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,827
You think you have
some kind of a special gift

705
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,871
- for knowing what's in my heart, Laura?
- No!

706
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,906
No, I think we both do for each other.

707
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,441
Has it ever occurred to you
that I might need a woman like Lila?

708
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:56,670
- And what kind of woman is that?
- I don't know. Somebody happy.

709
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,973
- Meaning numb?
- Somebody practical.

710
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,342
- Meaning busy.
- Somebody confident.

711
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:00,540
- Meaning rich. Meaning frigid!
- Somebody stable.

712
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:01,843
Somebody who doesn't
tear other people down

713
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,182
- just to build herself back up.
- In other words, your polar opposite.

714
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:07,551
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
- Well, haven't you heard?

715
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:12,024
Opposites attract and then
they bore each other to death.

716
00:52:12,161 --> 00:52:14,254
You know, boring is
better than maddening.

717
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,356
I'd rather die of excitement.

718
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,764
- Hey.
- What?

719
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,373
Hey, hey! Hey!

720
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:27,476
Do you remember that paper,
junior year?

721
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,237
Yeah. Of course.

722
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,109
The Hopeless Romantics:
Misconceptions of a Movement.

723
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:35,240
Yeah. Only you could start a
50-page paper the night before...

724
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,512
- And still get an A-minus.
- Because I wrote it.

725
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:41,317
You maybe wrote half of it.

726
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,489
Ode to a Nightingale:
A love song to inspiration.

727
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,393
The Romantics weren't
writing about love,

728
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:51,295
they were writing about religion.

729
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,959
Then I'm not sure
I know the difference.

730
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,172
"Forlorn.

731
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:04,212
The very word is like a bell tolling
me back from thee to my sole self."

732
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:08,879
What's the next line?

733
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,884
I can't remember.

734
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,252
Liar.

735
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,661
Anybody can make a big
romantic gesture, all right?

736
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:23,163
The question is:
What happens after?

737
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,859
Do you remember?

738
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,801
Do you remember
what you said to me that night?

739
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:33,466
- Yeah, I remember everything.
- So what'd you say?

740
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:37,843
- I said it was the perfect night.
- You said it was the perfect night.

741
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,473
- So?
- So? How do I top that?

742
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:45,177
- We had so much fun.
- We had so much fun.

743
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:46,618
So what's the problem with that?

744
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,815
The problem is, every time we
had one of these amazing nights,

745
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:52,359
I would wake up the next morning
in a freaking panic.

746
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,757
So why don't we just spare each other

747
00:53:55,898 --> 00:53:57,058
a mundane life
of crushing disappointment,

748
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,566
and just do it with somebody else.

749
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:03,365
That is the weakest excuse
I have ever heard.

750
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,736
- Just say you're in love with Lila.
- Say what?

751
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,843
Want me to say
that I want to marry you?

752
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:11,469
That I'm gonna spend the next 50 years
regretting this very moment?

753
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:15,212
You inspired me.

754
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:19,281
You inspired me, too.

755
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,856
Then we were supposed to be together.

756
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,259
I know.

757
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,800
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna...
I'm gonna tell everyone that you're OK.

758
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:40,636
But I'm not.

759
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,611
- I'm not OK.
- You chose this.

760
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,531
No! No, you can't!

761
00:56:18,307 --> 00:56:20,639
You're actually a lot of fun.

762
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,541
- Thanks?
- Yeah. No. Really.

763
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,740
- You're hilarious.
- Your surprise is disturbing.

764
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,045
Well, dude, you just
seem like a freaking...

765
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,381
...about to have a nervous breakdown
half the time.

766
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:33,784
Take a shot.

767
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:37,021
I'm marrying Jake, for Chrissakes.

768
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,060
That's true.

769
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,631
- It just got hot in here.
- Wait, cheers me.

770
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:44,164
Cheers you.

771
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:52,666
Hey, this stuff is strong.
What did you say you put in it, again?

772
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,640
I just crushed up
some of my old Lithium.

773
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:57,644
- No.
- Just joking!

774
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:02,149
Hey, hey, hey! What was that?

775
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,083
- What?
- I heard something.

776
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:09,549
Right!
OK, there's no Tom here.

777
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,991
- Yes, there's not.
- So, there goes your theory.

778
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,994
I still say he's in Lila's room.

779
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:21,635
- Why does everyone seem so happy?
- They're not.

780
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,970
- Really?
- Yeah.

781
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:26,233
I mean, Laura's depressed,
pretending to be happy.

782
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:27,364
Yeah.

783
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,239
Weesie's a mess, she pretends
to have her shit together.

784
00:57:29,378 --> 00:57:33,075
Pete is a screw-up,
pretending to be a success.

785
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,643
And what about you?

786
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:40,415
I'm, like, a miserable bastard
who's pretending to give a shit.

787
00:57:41,557 --> 00:57:42,615
- Wow.
- Yeah.

788
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:47,060
- You had me fooled.
- Well, good.

789
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,056
And what am I?

790
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:54,868
Well, at least you're honest.

791
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:42,875
- Laura? You're late!
- It's me.

792
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:49,153
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

793
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:53,661
- Honey, I'm superstitious!
- Please, just let me in.

794
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,836
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

795
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,971
You're having a
pre-wedding panic attack?

796
00:59:13,115 --> 00:59:15,481
Don't patronize me, OK?

797
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,984
- Lila, I love you.
- I love you, too.

798
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:25,525
Yeah, but why?

799
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:29,791
'Cause you're smart.
And charming and handsome.

800
00:59:29,932 --> 00:59:32,492
And you make me feel safe and happy.

801
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,829
And, when I'm with you,

802
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,633
even the most tedious things
are fun and exciting.

803
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:39,866
And you're a very good kisser.

804
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,273
- Thank you.
- It's true.

805
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:45,278
Why do you love me?

806
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,647
That's the thing. I don't...

807
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:58,317
- I don't know.
- I'm sorry. What?

808
01:00:02,965 --> 01:00:05,627
I'm so confused right now, I...

809
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,067
- You're not doing this now.
- Why not now?

810
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,732
- Isn't now better than later?
- OK.

811
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:16,777
I'll tell you why you love me.
Because you need me.

812
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,244
- We're so different.
- Yes, we are.

813
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,647
And when you're not behaving
like a total freak,

814
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,776
it's what makes us work.

815
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,821
- OK, you're patronizing me again.
- No, I'm not.

816
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:32,223
Why is emotion some kind of
a mental illness with you?

817
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,990
It is if you indulge in it all the time.

818
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,862
Don't you think I want to freak out?

819
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:43,494
Don't you think I want to lose my shit?

820
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,005
Why do you get to be the one
that drinks too much,

821
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:51,774
that says scandalous things,
that has wild mood swings?

822
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,176
Has it ever occurred to you

823
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:56,284
that those are freedoms
afforded to you by me?

824
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,786
Has it ever occurred to you that
my emotions are just as intense?

825
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,413
I just work harder to control them.

826
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,220
But why? You don't have to.
I wish that you would lose it more.

827
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:09,229
Who? Who should I lose it to?
My mom? My brother? You?

828
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:12,596
Take a look around you, Tom.
Somebody's gotta keep their cool.

829
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:25,538
I just... I need you to hold it
together for another 12 hours.

830
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:30,380
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah, I think so.

831
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:32,310
OK.

832
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:35,481
Now go find Pete and Jake

833
01:01:35,624 --> 01:01:39,025
and have a good talk before
you cause us any more bad luck.

834
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:41,424
OK.

835
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:10,147
William, wake up. I'm in a panic.

836
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,782
What's wrong?

837
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:14,559
It's going to rain.

838
01:02:16,765 --> 01:02:20,064
- Augusta, come on.
- William, will you wake up?

839
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:21,726
I'm up.

840
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:52,092
Who do you think helped
sculpt the ice penis...

841
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:54,327
I did. I did. I...

842
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,631
- Get out of town.
- I designed it.

843
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:58,899
Listen, the wildest thing
that you've ever done...

844
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,565
I designed it.

845
01:03:00,709 --> 01:03:04,076
...is roll down your window
on the drive up here.

846
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,644
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

847
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:09,751
- Is that a challenge?
- And what if it is?

848
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:12,945
I'll race you to the front porch.

849
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,683
We're talking fully dressed?

850
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:19,859
Fuck that. Buck naked.

851
01:03:19,995 --> 01:03:22,463
- Weesie. I like this.
- Yeah.

852
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,088
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- It's a new you.

853
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,564
- Now we're talking.
- Take it off.

854
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,135
You know, I haven't done anything
worthwhile since I was 18.

855
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,431
What'd you do when you were 18?

856
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,167
Cheated on my SATs and got into Yale.

857
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,174
Yeah, I was headed for greatness.

858
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,142
- Now I'm just headed for a breakdown.
- Oh, really?

859
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:38,644
Yeah.

860
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:43,144
Yeah. No, now is where you say,

861
01:03:43,285 --> 01:03:45,480
"You know what, Trip?
You're a great actress."

862
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,055
And I say, "You know what?
Your novel is gonna change the world."

863
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:52,092
Oh, yeah? You know what, Trip?
Great actress.

864
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,025
And your novel is gonna...

865
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:03,229
We don't really have to do this.

866
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,962
Yeah, let's not.

867
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:10,929
Funny idea, though.

868
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,044
You're not getting off that easy.

869
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:33,659
I'm alive!

870
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,895
- Oh, shit, let go. Let's get out.
- What? Wait!

871
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:46,633
Minnow?

872
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:57,217
No, no, no, no.

873
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,379
- Minnow!
- Look what I did, accidentally.

874
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:03,423
OK, OK, calm down. Calm down.

875
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:06,055
She's probably gonna come up here
in the morning.

876
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,560
I'm thinking.

877
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:10,290
OK. OK. OK.
This is what we're gonna do.

878
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:11,797
OK.

879
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:15,768
You're gonna count to 100.
I'm gonna go downstairs.

880
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:17,496
And when you hear me
go into Lila's room,

881
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:18,901
you're gonna make a break for it.

882
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:23,501
And we are gonna
deal with this tomorrow.

883
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:24,942
Start counting.

884
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:33,483
One, two, three...

885
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:36,883
- Laura, Trip, you're late!
- Just me.

886
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,992
- You said you'd be here at midnight.
- Yeah, I know.

887
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:43,189
We're druggie loser assholes.
I'm so sorry.

888
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,594
Where is everyone?

889
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:50,234
We all had so much to drink,
I doubt anyone's still standing.

890
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,781
Dude!

891
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:13,486
I just... I guess we'll never get
your alternative lifestyle, dude.

892
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,189
- What's up, dude?
- What's up, man?

893
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:19,300
Hey, you want a sweater
or something?

894
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:24,304
I ain't a for-real cowboy,
but I am one hell of a stud.

895
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,998
Here you go, sir.

896
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,210
Hey, is this cashmere?

897
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,238
I'm so sorry.

898
01:07:34,516 --> 01:07:35,505
It's fine.

899
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,175
Where's Laura?

900
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,714
God, I don't know where she is.

901
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:44,223
Actually, I saw her go
into the house about an hour ago.

902
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:46,486
So she said she was going to sleep.

903
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:52,291
What is up with the toga situation?

904
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:55,102
Don't ask.

905
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,302
What? It's...

906
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:01,102
- I couldn't find my...
- Dress?

907
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,342
It's... How are you?

908
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:55,293
- Any luck?
- No. You?

909
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:01,029
- No.
- This is bad.

910
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,400
I'm sure Chip and Laura
found him by now.

911
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,633
Yeah, if they're even still together.

912
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:09,073
Lila's gonna kill us.

913
01:09:10,712 --> 01:09:11,940
We should tell her.

914
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,878
No, we should not tell her
'cause she's gonna freak out.

915
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,644
That would be an appropriate response,
don't you think?

916
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,480
Why are you trying to cover your butt?

917
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,247
I'm not trying to cover my butt.
I did nothing wrong.

918
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,857
You guys, you guys,
just give him a few more hours.

919
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:25,789
There's no point in getting Lila
worked up if we can avoid it.

920
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,689
Exactly my point.

921
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,526
All right. Everybody in favor
of telling Lila?

922
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,033
No.

923
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:37,864
Everybody in favor of not telling Lila.

924
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:42,775
Fine. Let's just wait until it's light.

925
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:45,346
- OK.
- OK.

926
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,344
- All right.
- OK.

927
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,396
"Forlorn.

928
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:16,197
The very word is like a bell
tolling me back from thee

929
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:20,297
to my sole self.
Adieu.

930
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:25,038
The fancy cannot cheat so well
as she is famed to do, deceiving elf.

931
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:30,914
Adieu, adieu, thy plaintive anthem
fades past the near meadows,

932
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,284
over the still stream, up the hillside

933
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:39,190
and now 'tis buried deep
in the next valley glades.

934
01:11:39,327 --> 01:11:41,921
Was it a vision or a waking dream?

935
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:46,694
Fled is that music.
Do I wake or do I sleep?"

936
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:30,299
Look, there's Lo.

937
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,498
- Hey.
- Have you seen him?

938
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,544
Us, either.
We're gonna tell Lila right now.

939
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,613
- Wait.
- What is it? Where were you last night?

940
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:42,478
- Where were you last night?
- Oh, my God. You were with him.

941
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:43,982
- Trip, leave her alone.
- No, she was.

942
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,677
Why do you think that?

943
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,085
We don't have time for this
right now. Let's go.

944
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,418
Come on.

945
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:52,550
Minnow!

946
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,456
Look what she did.

947
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:05,464
Oh, darling, that's...

948
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,397
That's... We have enough time.
It can be fixed.

949
01:15:07,535 --> 01:15:11,335
Really. This will be fine.
I can fix this.

950
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:12,633
Lila, don't. Don't!

951
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,766
She didn't...
Lila, she didn't mean it! God!

952
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,184
You're so dead!

953
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:31,358
Stop!

954
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,698
Li, there's something
we need to tell you.

955
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:39,561
What is it?

956
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:41,997
- Tom's missing.
- Last night...

957
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,230
No, he's not.

958
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,937
- I saw Tom last night.
- Are you kidding me? That's great!

959
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:51,671
- Where is he now?
- There he is!

960
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:59,444
- Hey!
- I looked there.

961
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:01,511
You didn't look hard enough.

962
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,490
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

963
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:07,350
Big swim you went for.

964
01:16:07,495 --> 01:16:09,588
Oh, no, it's bad luck
for you to see each other

965
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,722
- before the wedding.
- Weesie, shut up.

966
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,730
I'm gonna go get ready.

967
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,705
- I am, too.
- OK.

968
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,915
Lila? Honey?

969
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,944
Hey.

970
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,546
Hey.

971
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,110
- You good?
- Yeah.

972
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:11,343
- Yeah.
- Got your lucky tie there?

973
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,014
I don't know.

974
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:18,853
You having some trouble
tying the knot there, buddy?

975
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,120
I'll be here all night.

976
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:28,462
- You might wanna shave.
- Shit, I forgot to shave too. OK.

977
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,298
What do you guys think of the hair?

978
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:31,564
There?

979
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:35,837
- Or...
- Or there?

980
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:40,679
Choose a side.

981
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:26,418
Where have you been?
I'm gonna need help with my zipper.

982
01:19:29,797 --> 01:19:31,196
- How's my makeup?
- Revolting.

983
01:19:31,332 --> 01:19:32,663
- And the hair?
- Trashy.

984
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,995
- You've seen my dress?
- Tacky choice.

985
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:38,003
Thank you. OK, perfect.

986
01:19:39,507 --> 01:19:40,997
Oh, my God!

987
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:43,970
I'm getting married!

988
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,049
Minnow? Come on in!

989
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,410
You look beautiful.

990
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,285
Oh, shit. I left my bouquets downstairs.
Could someone go get them?

991
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,948
- I will.
- Thank you.

992
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:01,084
All right. Dress.

993
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,096
- I believe I need to get dressed.
- Yes, let's do that.

994
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:08,862
There you are.
Thank goodness.

995
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,363
I was starting to think
you'd run off with those.

996
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:14,400
- Minnow?
- I'm sorry.

997
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:15,593
It's fine.
You were just in time.

998
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,967
No, not about the flowers.

999
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:21,969
I saw Tom last night.

1000
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:26,271
That's nice. Did you two
get a chance to catch up?

1001
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,075
I found him when he was missing.

1002
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,877
Guess those years
as a Girl Scout paid off.

1003
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:33,146
No, he wasn't lost. He was hiding.

1004
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:34,880
I know all about his meltdown.

1005
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,490
That's not what I mean.

1006
01:21:36,624 --> 01:21:38,319
Honey, you look so beautiful.

1007
01:21:38,459 --> 01:21:40,222
Girls, it's time to process.
Let's go.

1008
01:21:40,361 --> 01:21:41,419
What do you mean?

1009
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:49,032
I mean, Tom wasn't alone last night.
He was with me.

1010
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,831
We were together.

1011
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,236
Why are you telling me this right now?
This doesn't concern me.

1012
01:21:53,374 --> 01:21:54,671
- It doesn't?
- Laura...

1013
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:55,901
Trip, why don't we go...

1014
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,238
He's a groom. I'd be concerned

1015
01:21:57,378 --> 01:21:58,868
if he wasn't a wreck
the night before his wedding.

1016
01:21:59,013 --> 01:22:01,573
If he was in love with someone else,
would that concern you?

1017
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,980
Laura, this chapter is over.

1018
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:13,051
- Li. I love him.
- Yes. And I feel sorry for you.

1019
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:19,296
You know I have tried
to change these feelings.

1020
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:21,729
I've done everything.

1021
01:22:21,869 --> 01:22:25,635
Other guys, other towns, other jobs.

1022
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:29,669
And they say that it gets easier
with time, but it doesn't.

1023
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:32,541
If anything, the more time passes,
the more I miss him.

1024
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,615
Unrequited love is the
perfect romantic construct.

1025
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,241
It allows two cowardly people
to act out a fantasy of love

1026
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,877
without having to face
any real consequences.

1027
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:42,819
Li, you know he feels
the same way.

1028
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:44,925
He always has, and you know that.

1029
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:46,526
- You are my maid of honor!
- Yeah.

1030
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:50,222
And I have done everything I possibly
can to fulfill that obligation.

1031
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:53,528
I thought that I could
get through this. I did.

1032
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:55,135
But I can't, and he can't, either.

1033
01:22:55,269 --> 01:22:58,830
- He doesn't want this, either.
- You remember sophomore year?

1034
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:00,998
The Lit Christmas party
when you wore my dress?

1035
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:04,111
The red one I bought
especially for the event?

1036
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,475
You took that, too, without asking.

1037
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:08,206
And then when I went
to get ready for the event,

1038
01:23:08,349 --> 01:23:10,476
- my dress was missing.
- You know what?

1039
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:13,052
I picked that dress out.
When we were on Chapel Street,

1040
01:23:13,187 --> 01:23:17,351
we saw it in the window of Nelly's,
and you remember I picked it out

1041
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,393
and then you went back and you
bought it. I was the editor of Lit.

1042
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:23,224
It was my night.
It was my occasion.

1043
01:23:23,364 --> 01:23:27,095
Or the time I got the apple tattoo and
then a week later you got the same one?

1044
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:30,227
You saw me draw that in
19th Century Novel, OK?

1045
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:31,838
And then, all of a sudden,
you show up

1046
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:33,600
and you have it
branded on your tailbone.

1047
01:23:33,741 --> 01:23:36,232
Freshmen, sophomore,
every year of college,

1048
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:39,244
when I provided you months
of meticulous notes

1049
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:42,178
hours before the finals,
you feel entitled to my things...

1050
01:23:42,316 --> 01:23:46,912
- Mine, mine!
...because you want them!

1051
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:49,022
Yeah. Fine, you win, Lila.

1052
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,126
You provided me with
the meticulous study notes.

1053
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,354
But you know what?
I inspired your best ideas.

1054
01:23:55,496 --> 01:23:59,523
And when you got together with Tom,
senior spring, I was still dating him.

1055
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,635
Why are you doing this
to me right now?

1056
01:24:01,769 --> 01:24:04,761
Because you're about to marry a man,
and I don't think you should.

1057
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:06,999
You just can't bear to see me happy,

1058
01:24:07,141 --> 01:24:09,336
and so you have to
trash it with your emotions.

1059
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:14,005
No, Li. You deserve to be with
someone who is in love with you,

1060
01:24:14,148 --> 01:24:15,775
totally and completely.

1061
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:18,181
How dare you try to pass this off
as an act of friendship.

1062
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,879
- This is sabotage.
- No, this takes courage.

1063
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:24,116
Courage?! That's funny.

1064
01:24:24,258 --> 01:24:28,422
- I am not trying to hurt you.
- Yes, you are.

1065
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,259
That is your intention.
This has nothing to do with Tom.

1066
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,663
It's about me and you and your envy!

1067
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,130
No.

1068
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:45,203
You can't do this. You can't!
You can't bully me anymore.

1069
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:47,978
Obviously, I am torn.

1070
01:24:48,115 --> 01:24:51,209
And as your friend,
I do want what is best for you.

1071
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:54,515
But I can't keep putting you
ahead of me forever.

1072
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:58,921
My God, you're delusional. You actually
believe you're entitled to my fiance!

1073
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,993
This is not a difficult
or complicated situation, Laura.

1074
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:07,464
This is very simple.
I won and you're jealous.

1075
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,562
Jealous?

1076
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:14,707
No.

1077
01:25:15,943 --> 01:25:18,036
I pity you.

1078
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,879
Your groom is in love
with another woman.

1079
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:25,942
He asked me to marry him.

1080
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:27,145
Not you.

1081
01:25:36,497 --> 01:25:38,260
All this is...

1082
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:40,867
...certainly tragic.

1083
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:45,405
Debatably interesting,
but it really doesn't matter anymore,

1084
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,804
because he's marrying me
in ten minutes.

1085
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,610
Li, he cheated on you.

1086
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,679
No.

1087
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,444
You did.

1088
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,920
Oh, my God! Can I move yet?

1089
01:26:42,296 --> 01:26:44,423
I'm sorry about last night.

1090
01:26:45,933 --> 01:26:47,457
I was out of line.

1091
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,970
Yeah, you were.

1092
01:26:52,573 --> 01:26:55,041
Maybe I do need that ankle bracelet.

1093
01:26:57,011 --> 01:27:00,139
Seriously. I'm really sorry.

1094
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:04,407
Thank you.

1095
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:28,300
Love is like the ocean.
Vast, seemingly endless.

1096
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:32,634
Rocky, at times.
Peaceful, at others.

1097
01:28:32,773 --> 01:28:36,470
Daunting for all
its unexplored depths,

1098
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:40,637
but a constant source
of wonder and amazement.

1099
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:45,946
Tom and Lila have written
their own vows,

1100
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:49,181
in an expression of their creativity.

1101
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:54,894
Lila...

1102
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,064
Lila, when I...

1103
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:04,428
Lila...
When I look at you...

1104
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:08,139
...l'm speechless.

1105
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:12,611
I literally have nothing to say.

1106
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:18,782
You know, I...

1107
01:29:18,919 --> 01:29:20,819
If I...

1108
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,088
Did you feel that?

1109
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:31,926
What? No, I didn't.

1110
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:37,561
Lila, words fail the depth and
complexity of my feelings for you.

1111
01:29:39,673 --> 01:29:41,334
I need canons of literature,

1112
01:29:41,475 --> 01:29:45,343
unwritten books,
an entirely new language.

1113
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:56,322
But the thing is,
without words, I have nothing.

1114
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:00,184
I have nothing.

1115
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,795
You know, I... If I...

1116
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:08,801
Maybe I should say it for you.

1117
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:25,181
Get the dress!
