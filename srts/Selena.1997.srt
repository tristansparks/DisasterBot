1
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,864
Hey, is everything all right?

2
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:56,267
Selena!

3
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:58,405
You're still not dressed?

4
00:00:58,405 --> 00:00:59,606
M'hija, she's getting ready.

5
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:00,732
I can't decide what to wear.

6
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:03,110
- Mom, could you tell her something?
- Anybody seen an eyelash?

7
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,442
You are always late, Selena.

8
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,010
Which one?

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,111
Here it is. Cool.

10
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:12,912
Dang, girl, that'll look great.

11
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:17,601
Abraham, is it true that this is the largest
crowd in the history of the Astrodome?

12
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,419
That's what they're telling me.

13
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:22,746
What about the English-speaking album
we've been hearing about for some time now?

14
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:24,459
Should be out by later this year.

15
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:25,966
You'll knock them dead.

16
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:26,890
Thanks, baby.

17
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,525
I found your eyelash.

18
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,767
It's a madhouse out there.
Is she ready yet?

19
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:32,235
MARCELA. Not yet.

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,765
- Right there.
- They're hanging from the rafters.

21
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:36,065
Let's go. You look good.

22
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:43,314
WOMAN. Selena!

23
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:45,907
Hi.

24
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:48,548
Good luck.

25
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:52,483
Go for it, honey.

26
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:54,090
I'll be watching you.

27
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,555
Good luck.

28
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,957
¡Selena, acá!

29
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,666
How you doing, Houston, Texas?

30
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:23,242
- Robert.
- Yeah.

31
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:24,642
- EQ the snare.
- Sure, Abraham.

32
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:25,879
Give me more height.

33
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,011
I want to feel the bass drum,
come on.

34
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,950
Man, she looks beautiful.

35
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:24,335
Go, girl.

36
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:03,297
Yeah!

37
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:04,197
Yeah!

38
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:04,699
Beautiful!

39
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,699
- Nice job, gentlemen, nice job.
- So what do you think?

40
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:08,299
I think we're gonna
knock them dead, studs.

41
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,501
So what should we ask for?

42
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:10,633
You know, the money.

43
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,068
I mean, this is our
first professional gig.

44
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,439
Not too much, Abraham.

45
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,076
Let them offer us something.

46
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,406
After all, they want us
to audition, right?

47
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,716
Nice.

48
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:34,294
Who are you?

49
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,194
What are you doing in my place?

50
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,461
Good morning, Sir.

51
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,899
We're The Dinos!

52
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:42,601
The Dinos?

53
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,798
Yes.

54
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,803
You want to wait right there
just a minute?

55
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,163
I don't care if the kids like them,

56
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,713
they're a bunch of Mexicans.

57
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:54,977
You didn't tell me
they were Mexicans,

58
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:56,607
I thought they were Italian.

59
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,448
I can't have that in my club.

60
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,511
This club is whites only,
you know that, Charlie.

61
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:09,986
This is for you.

62
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,430
For all your trouble
coming out here today.

63
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,200
I sure do appreciate it, but...

64
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,800
There's been a mistake, and...

65
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,893
We can't do the audition today.

66
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:19,735
We'll call you.

67
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,095
Okay?

68
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:29,839
Let's get out of here.

69
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:52,070
Nobody's kicking us out
of this joint, guys.

70
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,140
After all, the Tejanos are
Mejicanos like us.

71
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,608
- That's right, Daddy-o.
- Alright, let's go to work.

72
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,772
That's gringo music!
We want rancheras and polkas!

73
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,580
Get them out of here!

74
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,980
Fuck off!

75
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,118
We want to dance real music!

76
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,224
Are you guys gringos?

77
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:13,021
Play some Mexican music!

78
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:19,428
What kind of music is this?

79
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,628
We didn't come here for this!

80
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:28,337
You guys better play some Mexican music
or this crowd's gonna tear the place down!

81
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,175
They wanna dance!

82
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,743
We don't know any Mexican music.

83
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,443
You...

84
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:37,643
Kick them out!

85
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:39,574
Listen up, please.

86
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:41,074
Listen, listen, listen.

87
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,874
First off, thank you so much
for coming out here tonight.

88
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:47,574
We really appreciate--
Listen.

89
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:50,074
This dance... is over.

90
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,428
You're gonna get your money back!

91
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,066
We want to dance!

92
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,066
We want to dance!

93
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,776
They're madder than
a bunch of hornets!

94
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:12,076
What'd y'all do, anyway?

95
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:15,085
We sang 'We Belong Together'.

96
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,926
We want to dance!

97
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:55,487
Gross! Selena!

98
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:57,585
Selena?

99
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,333
Selena!
- Mommy!

100
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,465
Honey, come inside.

101
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,572
Why'd you leave April in the shower?

102
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,472
She was sleeping.
I didn't want to wake her up.

103
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:13,942
<i>There was caca everywhere.
You'll have to clean it up.</i>

104
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,944
Okay. Mommy?

105
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,277
Can we have a farm
with chickens and goats and cows,

106
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:21,286
and horses and pigs...

107
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:23,619
First take care of April.

108
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,952
Right now. Go on!

109
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:43,172
Go, Selena!

110
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,704
Touchdown!

111
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,443
Let's get another touchdown.

112
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,720
Let her go!

113
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,457
Hello.
We're playing a game here!

114
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,459
She's a big baby.

115
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:12,471
Come in.

116
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,290
Wow!

117
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:16,894
What're you doing?

118
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,233
What's it look like?
- What's this?

119
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,294
Starting a band.

120
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,603
Who's starting a band?
- Me, the kids, you. Rock and roll!

121
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:25,711
How'd you pay for this?

122
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,302
Take it back! Get the money back.

123
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:30,041
Hold it, take a look at this stuff.

124
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:33,847
It's all secondhand.
Practically given to me. Bring it in.

125
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,148
Hey, Abraham!

126
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:36,813
Hey, how you doing?

127
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:39,425
We need to talk about this.

128
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,550
Abraham, you're not listening to me.

129
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:44,454
Abraham.

130
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:47,459
You said you got music
all out of your system.

131
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,492
I did get it out of my system.

132
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:52,070
You were never home.
There was no money.

133
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:55,107
You weren't there when Suzette was born!
You were at a gig!

134
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,039
Help me with this cord.

135
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:00,068
That was the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

136
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,908
I've tried to make it up to you ever since.

137
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:04,447
But this...

138
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,846
This is different.

139
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:09,319
This is like a fun,
spare-time thing, all right?

140
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:12,356
Like a hobby, okay?
- A hobby.

141
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:15,461
That we can all do together with the kids.

142
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:19,326
You know what happens
if we don't play with the kids.

143
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,762
They're going to end up
on street corners, getting into trouble.

144
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:25,764
This is something special
we can do together.

145
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,464
Just a hobby?
- Just a hobby.

146
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:32,510
Something for them to do together?
- Yup. Do together.

147
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,512
And they love rock and roll.

148
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:37,343
Damn!

149
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,343
Oh, damn!

150
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,351
We'll play rock and roll.

151
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:45,120
No, I don't want to play.

152
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:49,628
You like rock and roll.
- To listen to, not play.

153
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:51,559
Yeah, Dad, we like the Eagles!

154
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:53,359
We're not playing that.

155
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,628
I think Dad has gone crazy this time.

156
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:58,695
Press it.

157
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:00,372
Hit it.

158
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:03,175
She's not going to play,
she's going to sing.

159
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,377
Go ahead. Sing!

160
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:11,277
See? That sounds good.
- Wait a minute.

161
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:13,945
What am I supposed to play?
- The drums.

162
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,954
The drums? No way!

163
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:19,351
Come on.
- No way. Girls don't play the drums.

164
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:20,551
Yes, they do.

165
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,221
No way, Dad! No way!
Girls don't play the drums!

166
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:25,922
Let me show you real quick.

167
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:29,399
<i>Try it. Mi hijita, this is so good.</i>

168
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,834
I don't want to play the drums!
Forget it!

169
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:35,534
Oh, shit!

170
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:36,937
Are you okay?

171
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:38,408
Yeah, I'm all right.

172
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:53,385
Sick, sick, sick!

173
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,560
Have you ever seen a girl
playing the drums?

174
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:57,958
Hello!

175
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,796
Listen! Have you ever seen a girl
playing the drums? No!

176
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:05,166
You see them playing the harp,
you see them playing everything...

177
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:07,172
Why is there no music?

178
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,408
We've been talking
and we'd rather go outside and play.

179
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:16,710
I mean, not this play, but play as in "run."

180
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:18,613
You can play outside in an hour.

181
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:22,176
<i>Okay? Right now I want you
to play Feelings.</i>

182
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:24,120
<i>Feelings?</i>

183
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,088
Play it!
No way!

184
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:30,454
Why not?
- It's the '50s!

185
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:33,622
That song's way out of style!
The '50s are over!

186
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,293
We want to play stuff we like.
Stuff that's cool!

187
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:39,234
Stuff that's happening.
- Show me what's happening.

188
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:46,103
Shut up!

189
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,607
<i>It's too cool for me. Play Blue Moon.</i>

190
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,844
Come on, Dad.
Look at you guys.

191
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,284
Fifteen minutes.

192
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:56,251
Fifteen minutes of real playing.

193
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:59,120
Abie, Selena.

194
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,854
Okay. Go ahead, count it off.

195
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:12,263
That's better.

196
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,636
You know, I've been thinking.

197
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,112
Here in Lake Jackson,

198
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:26,850
there are a lot of gringos.

199
00:18:27,954 --> 00:18:28,978
What?

200
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,118
We wanted something better for the kids.

201
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:35,954
Better than the barrio.
- Yeah, but...

202
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,997
There are no Mexican restaurants here.

203
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:41,732
And gringos love Mexican food.

204
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,864
Are you thinking of opening a restaurant?

205
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:49,872
Yes, I am.
There's a lot of money to be made.

206
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,806
You've got a good job.

207
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:54,004
I mean a good restaurant.
- A steady job.

208
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:55,671
We just bought this house!

209
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,147
What are you thinking of?

210
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,408
Listen...

211
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:00,816
I'm not going to quit my job, all right?

212
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,515
But a good Mexican restaurant...

213
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:10,726
Ay, Abraham!

214
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:13,831
Never satisfied.

215
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,163
There's enough room.
- Always dreaming.

216
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,829
Put up a stage for some music.
- Music?

217
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,299
That's what this is about, isn't it? Music!

218
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:24,241
No, this is about food.

219
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,378
Okay? And I'm hungry.

220
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:34,182
The kids could play. We'd be together.
The clients would love it.

221
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,187
You wouldn't quit your job, right?

222
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,158
No, I wouldn't quit my job.

223
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:43,551
Oh, God.

224
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,961
I gotta tell you,
you got it centered.

225
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,397
It looks great.

226
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:49,957
But I don't buy that "G."
The "G" is perfect.

227
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,603
It looks like a "Y"!

228
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:54,365
It looks great.
It looks like "Papayoyo's"!

229
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:57,202
It's "Papagayo's." Perfect.
Go back up.

230
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:59,437
We're exhausted.
Look at the "Y."

231
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:00,739
"Papa Y"?

232
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:02,337
It's "G."
- It's "Papagayo."

233
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:04,349
It says, "Papayoyo's."
- Come on.

234
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,385
Let's go home.
- Go ahead.

235
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:07,885
Look.
Okay, stay.

236
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:10,046
Stay!
- Out the way, I'll do it.

237
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:12,090
Let me do it. I want to do it.

238
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:13,590
If you don't let me do it...

239
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:14,751
Watch out!

240
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,787
How's it going?

241
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:47,189
You were right, gringos like Mexican food.

242
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:49,784
They like it so much,
we'll run out pretty soon.

243
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,659
I must talk to you.
- Hold on.

244
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:53,628
Where are my enchiladas?

245
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:56,831
I had to quit my job today.

246
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:59,933
I didn't want to.
They didn't want me to be here today.

247
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,234
They wanted me to work.
I wanted to be here.

248
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:04,401
Do you have to take this?
Yes!

249
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,841
I'll take your order in a minute.

250
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,679
We'll bring your food in a minute.
Whose plate is this?

251
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,651
That girl is really cute.

252
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:19,657
That's my daughter.
She sings pretty, doesn't she?

253
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:24,523
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

254
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:27,029
I'll bring somebody to pick this up.

255
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:32,736
I just dropped a plate over there.
Go pick it up! Now!

256
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,066
These plates are too hot.
Move them from the fire! Now!

257
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:40,903
Everything will be fine.
They love the restaurant.

258
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:44,380
The people love our band.
They love the kids.

259
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,314
You heard that lady.
We'll make a lot of money here.

260
00:21:47,687 --> 00:21:50,679
Abraham, I don't care about the money,
you know that.

261
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,518
As long as the kids are taken care of,
I don't care.

262
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,519
We had everything.

263
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:58,858
We bought our house so our kids
would grow up in a nice place.

264
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:01,261
That was my dream.

265
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:03,161
We had security.

266
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:05,267
You promised me.

267
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,542
I guess this is your dream.

268
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:16,875
I'm sure everything'll be fine.

269
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,109
Marcela.

270
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:48,908
What are you doing here?

271
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,141
I'm looking up at the moon.

272
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:54,214
And I'm dreaming.

273
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,344
About?

274
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,585
Let's just say you wouldn't imagine
what my dreams are like.

275
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,125
When I saw those people applauding...

276
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:05,253
I mean, what did you feel?
What did you think?

277
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:08,527
It was so cool. I've never seen
so many people smile before.

278
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:10,535
It was exciting.
- I know.

279
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:11,661
It was.

280
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:15,138
When I'm up on stage,

281
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,974
I feel like

282
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:20,368
I can be anything I want to be.

283
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:50,306
Don't steal them all!
Don't hog the candy!

284
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,502
Selena, come here. Come here.

285
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,472
Come here. Look at this.

286
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,641
Come on, Dad. Please.

287
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:01,618
I want to go outside and play.
- Come on, just a second.

288
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,019
Give me a minute, okay?
Here, look at this.

289
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:07,186
What's this?
- It's a song in Spanish.

290
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:08,992
I don't know Spanish.

291
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,688
<i>Say that word, reloj.</i>

292
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:15,731
Put your tongue on the roof
of your mouth, then blow air out.

293
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:21,496
Did you feel it? Do it again.

294
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:24,299
<i>Say that word, reloj.</i>

295
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,540
Perfect.

296
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:33,446
That means,

297
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,046
"Clock, don't mark the hours
because I'm going nuts."

298
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,092
I know, it sounds weird in English...

299
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:44,719
Dad, what's this about?
- It's about learning to sing in Spanish.

300
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,026
I don't want to sing in Spanish.
I don't like Spanish music.

301
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,262
I like Donna Summer. That's what I like.

302
00:24:51,337 --> 00:24:52,668
You like performing?

303
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:57,471
Yeah, Dad, I love it. It's like
you can feel them when you sing.

304
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:58,908
It's a wonderful feeling.

305
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:01,908
But let me tell you something
I learned the hard way.

306
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,743
I don't want you to learn the hard way.

307
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,584
When I was singing with Los Dinos,

308
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:11,119
one time they started throwing
beer bottles at me.

309
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:14,191
It sounds funny, but it scared me.

310
00:25:14,894 --> 00:25:16,794
But I did learn something.

311
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:19,926
You've got to be who you are.
You can't change it.

312
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:22,558
You're an American.

313
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,262
I'm an American.

314
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:26,896
You like Donna Summer. I like doo-wop.

315
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,937
But you're also Mexican, deep inside.

316
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:31,599
That's a wonderful thing.

317
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,372
You can't be anything
if you don't know who you are.

318
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,712
If you're a singer, you must sing
to people from deep inside here.

319
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:41,314
You know what's in there?
- Your heart.

320
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:49,287
So you're saying I gotta
learn how to sing this stuff.

321
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:50,487
Remember,

322
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:54,089
"Clock, don't mark the hours
because I'm going nuts."

323
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:08,777
I don't understand. We were doing
so good the first nine months.

324
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,508
It's that Ronald Reagan.

325
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,508
Reaganomics.

326
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:15,619
A lot of small businesses have gone broke.

327
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,720
Come on, Abraham.

328
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,195
Let's go home, huh?

329
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,641
I don't want to leave my home.

330
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:47,151
Me either. Do you know how many
cousins we have at Uncle Hector's?

331
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:50,854
Come on, let's go.
Abie, are my keys in there?

332
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,783
I don't think so.

333
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:54,385
Check the house.

334
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:57,291
Dad, your keys are in the car.

335
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,861
What?
Your keys are in the car.

336
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,990
The keys are on the seat.

337
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,566
Get in the car.

338
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,498
I'm coming.

339
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:08,998
Put your seat belt on.

340
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:11,565
Do we have to go
to Uncle Hector's?

341
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:26,671
<i>ABRAHAM. I'm calling because
I started up a new group.</i>

342
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,577
<i>Selena y Los Dinos.</i>

343
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,477
<i>No, none of the old Dinos.</i>

344
00:27:32,588 --> 00:27:36,115
<i>These are all new Dinos.
You're not going to believe this.</i>

345
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,392
<i>They're my kids.</i>

346
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:39,859
<i>Selena 's my daughter.</i>

347
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,394
She's nine years old.

348
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:45,229
She's great. You gotta believe me.

349
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,198
She's got all the moves.
She's a natural performer.

350
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,238
Sings from the heart.

351
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:53,239
No, Freddie, listen, please.

352
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:55,071
I don't care about the money.

353
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:58,408
I just want to get them some exposure.
They play everything.

354
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:02,072
Freddie, this is familia. You gotta do it.

355
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,543
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands
together for Selena y Los Dinos!</i>

356
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:06,704
<i>Let's hear it, Harlingen.</i>

357
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:15,155
<i>In just a few minutes
we're gonna have a group called...</i>

358
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,856
You guys did so good. Come downstairs.

359
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,157
<i>You did good, mi hijo.</i>

360
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:28,461
You did good.
- You gotta pick it up.

361
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:31,335
The rhythm wasn't fast enough.
- We have bad material.

362
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,466
They weren't dancing because
you weren't playing it right.

363
00:29:34,543 --> 00:29:37,535
Abraham, the kids did great.
The kids did great.

364
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:38,704
They did great.

365
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,305
I'm proud of you. You did really good!

366
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:43,874
If you'd like to write the songs,
be my guest.

367
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:46,978
Until then, just keep the rhythm up,
so they can dance.

368
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,784
We need to talk, okay?

369
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:52,122
<i>Kids, why don't you go to the car?
- Tejanos like to dance.</i>

370
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,787
Go on! It's okay.

371
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:56,455
We'll be there in a minute.

372
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:58,288
Come here.

373
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:02,302
What're we doing?

374
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:04,305
What are we doing to our kids?

375
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,614
The kids are good, and they'll get better.

376
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:17,514
The kids are kids. They're children!

377
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:20,316
We should be taking care of them,
not hurting them.

378
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:23,219
Selena is just a little girl.

379
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:26,490
Even if she keeps going
and keeps singing...

380
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:29,155
Tejano music is all men. You know that.

381
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:31,161
Women are not successful.

382
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:45,044
Marcela, everything you're saying
I understand.

383
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,411
But she is special.

384
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:52,248
She's got it. I can feel it. I know it.

385
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,786
She's going to make it.

386
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:58,422
Come on, I'm sorry.

387
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:00,392
I'm sorry.

388
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:08,533
<i>ABRAHAM.
I know what you're thinking right now.</i>

389
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:11,367
You're thinking that
after what happened at Harlingen,

390
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,540
we should quit.

391
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:15,369
Yes.

392
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:19,778
Let me just tell you something.

393
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:21,939
You guys are going to make it.

394
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:24,047
You're going to record records.

395
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:27,212
You're going to play everywhere,
even Disney Worid.

396
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,085
Disney Worid?

397
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:32,290
You think we'll make it there?

398
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,960
I know you will.

399
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:38,396
I also know how hard it is
to make it in the music business.

400
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,761
But every star that's a star right now
had their Harlingen once.

401
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:46,964
And if we try hard
and if we really want it

402
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:49,407
we can do it.

403
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,708
Do you believe me?

404
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:56,081
Yeah, Daddy. I believe you.

405
00:32:09,331 --> 00:32:10,730
You hear that music?

406
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,000
That's a cumbia.

407
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:15,728
A cumbia?

408
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:18,670
It's a dance Dad and I danced
when we were young.

409
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:22,443
We did. She used to do
the washing machine.

410
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,607
Want me to show you?

411
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,442
Come here.
- Watch that.

412
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,009
First we start

413
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,451
moving your hips

414
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:34,819
like this.

415
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:36,954
<i>There you go, mija.</i>

416
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,951
Then bigger.

417
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:40,355
Bigger.

418
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:41,962
Add a little hop.

419
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:43,624
There you go.

420
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:46,292
Do the washing machine!
- Wait a minute!

421
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:47,767
There you go.

422
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:51,032
You get the washing machine going.
Your father likes it.

423
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:54,131
That's the washing machine.
There you go!

424
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,170
You make a little circle. And spin.

425
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:08,353
There you go!

426
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,142
How does the bass sound?
It sounds good.

427
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:56,996
What is it?
- What's she wearing?

428
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:59,056
She's practically got nothing on!

429
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,828
She's in her bra!

430
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:04,599
It's not just her bra. It's a thing
like all the girls are wearing.

431
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:07,267
She can't wear that.
There are men out here!

432
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:11,402
It's a bustier.

433
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:14,676
Bustier! That's a bra! Look at it!

434
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:17,183
I think she looks cute.

435
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,150
Hey, girl!

436
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:32,851
Say "hi" to the camera!

437
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,326
Hi, how are you?

438
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:35,693
You look so pretty!

439
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:38,756
Tell us what it feels like
to be on the stage.

440
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:43,503
I'd like to thank all the little people
I stepped on to get here.

441
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:46,804
No more pictures, please!

442
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:50,271
$620?

443
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,980
This is not what we were talking about.

444
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:56,741
That's the way it is.

445
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:02,212
Those people came to see Selena tonight.
They love Selena!

446
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,221
What can I say?

447
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,984
She's just a woman.

448
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:13,361
You got my chin, dude.

449
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:15,932
When are we getting a road crew?

450
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:18,529
Dad's happy with the road crew he has.

451
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:20,904
And I do mean you!
'Cause it's free.

452
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:23,443
Let's go, we've got
a whole stage out there.

453
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,214
Turn that thing off.

454
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:29,715
What's gotten into you?

455
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:31,843
Why are you wearing that?

456
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:33,614
Come on, Dad, she looked great.

457
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:34,813
Stay out of this.

458
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:36,389
It's just a bustier.

459
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,392
It's a cool thing.
It's a bra!

460
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,792
It's a bra with sprinkly things!

461
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:43,961
You cannot go out there
wearing stuff like that.

462
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,265
It's indecent!

463
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:48,530
It's okay. She looked so good!

464
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,036
The crowd loved it!

465
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:52,265
Shut up! She's not your daughter!

466
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:55,604
You don't understand.
All the singers are doing it. It's the style.

467
00:37:55,677 --> 00:37:58,578
They're wearing bras?
- Madonna, Janet Jackson.

468
00:37:58,646 --> 00:37:59,977
Paula Abdul.

469
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:03,240
Mom, would you tell him?
You helped me make it.

470
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:06,048
You helped her make it?

471
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:08,986
We did sew the jewels on together.

472
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:12,455
How come nobody can talk to me
about this kind of stuff?

473
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:15,154
You can't wear this kind of stuff!
Is that clear?

474
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:18,154
The rest of you guys,
get the equipment in here.

475
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,460
Come on!

476
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:24,965
We'll talk to him later.
Forget it.

477
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:28,305
Let's go get some more shit.

478
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:31,268
So much for my bustier.

479
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:47,285
You still mad?

480
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:01,498
I'm just trying to do what's best for you.
Sorry for exploding.

481
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:04,508
But, you know...

482
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:07,010
You're my little girl.

483
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:08,378
I know that.

484
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:11,310
That's just it. I'm not a little girl anymore.

485
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:13,148
You know what I mean.

486
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:17,848
I didn't wear anything bad.
Really, no one thought it was bad.

487
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:21,154
That's just the fashion right now.

488
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,126
On stage, you know.

489
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:25,059
It's entertainment.

490
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:27,363
We don't want to be old-fashioned, right?

491
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,634
No, we don't want to be old-fashioned.

492
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:34,836
Don't you think I look just as good
in those outfits as Paula Abdul?

493
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,139
You look better. But...

494
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:38,678
But what?

495
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:44,151
Keep your jackets on, okay?

496
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,550
Just leave them unbuttoned and

497
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:48,388
let the

498
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:50,554
"bustiela"...

499
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,393
Bustier!

500
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,694
Thanks, Daddy.

501
00:40:08,176 --> 00:40:09,905
Take Bertha and fuel it up.

502
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:12,173
Gas is miles down the road!

503
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,373
Diesel fuel. Don't make any mistakes.

504
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:16,575
I can't even switch the gears.

505
00:40:16,684 --> 00:40:20,381
You can do it. You've been practicing.
I've seen you do it.

506
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:24,189
Not by myself.
- You can do it.

507
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:26,522
What's up?
- You can do it.

508
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:28,392
Go with him.
- All right.

509
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,554
Diesel!

510
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:32,225
Shotgun. You're fueling.
I hate that.

511
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,198
You tanking up the bus?

512
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:36,099
Wait! We're going!

513
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:37,796
Just stay out!

514
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:39,999
Look at Wonder Woman and her sister.

515
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:42,941
Quiet! I gotta see you drive
Big Bertha. Let's go.

516
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:45,411
I can do this.
- Last time it was disastrous.

517
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,844
Here we go!

518
00:40:48,116 --> 00:40:50,983
This is good, Abie.
Smooth!

519
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:52,781
I need Dramamine!

520
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:55,379
Bertha and I are one!
I'm getting dizzy!

521
00:40:57,392 --> 00:40:58,450
We lost a bumper!

522
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,985
What'll that do?
That's all I could find.

523
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,827
It's the biggest one I could find!
More grass!

524
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:07,663
Give me something else!
Look where we are!

525
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,527
You'll get dirty.

526
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:12,003
Get the bus out, or Dad'll kill me!

527
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:14,541
There's no more stuff.
- Go get more stuff.

528
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:18,171
Consider yourselves dead,
because it's not working.

529
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:21,238
Hey, dude, stop! Come on!

530
00:41:22,383 --> 00:41:24,044
You're scaring the cars away.

531
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:25,813
What should I do?
- Stand back.

532
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,946
You're crazy.
- Let the master work.

533
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,046
Show him.

534
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,152
Here comes one now!

535
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:42,564
They stopped!

536
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:44,294
<i>Did you see that ruca?</i>

537
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:46,498
She looks just like Salinas!

538
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:50,000
Rewind. Come on, let's go!

539
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:52,072
<i>Mas, mas!</i>

540
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,215
Can you help us out? We're stuck.

541
00:41:57,385 --> 00:41:59,683
It is Salinas!

542
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:04,053
We've been stuck for a long time.

543
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:07,891
This ditch just snuck up on us.
Now we need to get pulled out.

544
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:11,687
I got a V-8 and 400 horses.
I can pull anything out of anywhere.

545
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:14,131
<i>Mi hermanita won't believe this!</i>

546
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:17,664
If you pull it forward there,
we'll hook it up.

547
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,434
Right here.
- Thanks.

548
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:28,038
A little bit more.
- Go for it, dude. Move it.

549
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:39,525
Go for it! Gun it!

550
00:42:39,627 --> 00:42:40,753
I'm giving it all I got!

551
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:42,260
Gun it!
Go for it!

552
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:52,896
The bumper, man.

553
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:55,375
Look at this.

554
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:58,943
We'll buy you a new one.

555
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,638
Sorry.
We'll buy one.

556
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:01,772
We'll replace it.

557
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,851
We'll polish it.
What can we do?

558
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:06,113
You need a new one?
You kidding?

559
00:43:06,254 --> 00:43:09,951
This bumper's going to go
on the wall of my garage.

560
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:12,150
I'll put a sign under it saying,

561
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:16,962
"This bumper was pulled off
by the bus of Salinas."

562
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:19,062
You like that?

563
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:23,296
Anything for Salinas.
Thanks.

564
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:24,736
Let's go.

565
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:26,398
Let's get that in first.

566
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:28,405
Let's put it in.

567
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,507
Watch the seat.

568
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:32,944
It was cool of you to do this.
Thanks.

569
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:35,574
No problem.
You need a ride to a phone?

570
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:37,810
We passed a phone a couple miles back.

571
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:40,284
Yeah, there's no one around.

572
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:41,786
We'll have to call Dad.

573
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:45,586
"I can't believe
this, son. What were you thinking?"

574
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:49,524
I can't believe this, son.
What were you thinking?

575
00:43:49,597 --> 00:43:51,622
What happened?
- Where are you?

576
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,293
Who's laughing? Selena?

577
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:56,365
Where are you?

578
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,429
He didn't care about his bumper?

579
00:43:59,607 --> 00:44:01,006
No, he was happy.

580
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:03,975
<i>You should have seen these
two tough cholos. Right?</i>

581
00:44:04,045 --> 00:44:05,342
They had tattoos and goatees.

582
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:06,710
They were cool.

583
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:08,805
He wants to hang it in his garage.

584
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:10,177
Like a shrine.

585
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:12,809
He was like, "Anything for Salinas!"

586
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:16,184
Not "Selena" but "Salinas"
with an "S." It was weird.

587
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,782
He didn't even let me pay for it.

588
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,590
He was happy to have his bumper
taken off by our bus.

589
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:23,357
By Salinas' bus.

590
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:25,159
That's right.

591
00:44:27,468 --> 00:44:28,628
Quit it.

592
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,326
You're it, girl.

593
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:32,837
I'm scared of you, girlfriend.

594
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:34,998
<i>"Mi hermanita won't believe this!"</i>

595
00:44:36,477 --> 00:44:37,671
Anything for...

596
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,676
Salinas!

597
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,213
They were not saying that!

598
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:44,010
Salinas with an "S."

599
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:52,383
I'm studying!

600
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,460
Oh, "I'm studying!"

601
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,759
Salinas!

602
00:45:05,693 --> 00:45:07,285
<i>See, this is it.</i>
Isn't it cute?

603
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:10,065
We could make, like, cowhide
trousers for the guys.

604
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:13,668
And then like a little bolero jacket for me.
And then all black underneath. Right?

605
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,837
You come up with the cutest designs.

606
00:45:15,837 --> 00:45:17,972
Thanks. And little rhinestones everywhere.

607
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:19,774
I think you should be a designer.

608
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:22,072
Really? I always wanted to do that.

609
00:45:22,277 --> 00:45:25,273
OK, y'all are never going to
believe what's downstairs.

610
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:26,973
- What?
- Come here!

611
00:45:27,315 --> 00:45:28,839
Wait for me!

612
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:35,984
What planet did he come from?

613
00:45:36,491 --> 00:45:38,288
Planet Dump Truck.

614
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,580
Excuse us for a second.

615
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,880
Sure.

616
00:46:06,321 --> 00:46:07,948
Go on.

617
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:13,962
I know he looks a little weird,
I told you that. But he's brilliant.

618
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:16,431
Yeah, but doesn't play our kind of music,
he plays heavy metal.

619
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:18,199
Dad, he's a Tejano musician!

620
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:21,698
He's versatile, he can play anything.
That's just the kind of music he likes.

621
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:29,143
He's been in some trouble.
He's wild.

622
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:31,034
Dad, he's not wild.
It's just musician stuff.

623
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,840
Come on, you should know about that.

624
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:34,716
Look, I'll take care of him.

625
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:37,449
He's a cool guy, really.
Look, come on.

626
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:39,143
The boy can play.

627
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,592
How about cutting your hair?

628
00:46:55,637 --> 00:46:56,695
Whatever.

629
00:47:06,014 --> 00:47:07,379
Stand still.

630
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:09,643
- You're gonna drown me.
- I'm not gonna drown you.

631
00:47:10,185 --> 00:47:12,619
The water's hot!
I'm telling you, it's hot!

632
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,857
Now it's too cold!

633
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:20,492
- I'm out of here.
- You're not going anywhere.

634
00:47:22,063 --> 00:47:24,429
There's way too much hair
on the floor.

635
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:30,802
That's too much!

636
00:47:37,011 --> 00:47:38,479
Are you guys done yet?

637
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:40,811
Dude, you look so good.

638
00:47:41,516 --> 00:47:42,778
Are you ready?

639
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:46,486
Selena!

640
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,924
- Come here!
- I'll go get her.

641
00:47:54,095 --> 00:47:55,221
What?

642
00:48:01,402 --> 00:48:02,801
Looks good.

643
00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:06,064
Cool.

644
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:13,002
Thank you.

645
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,108
You walk with him.
I'm with you.

646
00:48:23,124 --> 00:48:25,490
Hey, Sel. How's it going?

647
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,327
Good. How about you?

648
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:30,090
Doing okay?
The guys treating you all right?

649
00:48:30,164 --> 00:48:32,496
The guys are cool. I like the group.

650
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:34,497
I like the bus!

651
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:38,932
This turned out good.

652
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:41,304
Suzy did a good job.

653
00:48:41,576 --> 00:48:42,838
Yeah, I dig it.

654
00:48:43,444 --> 00:48:44,843
I like it if you like it.

655
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:46,470
I like it. It looks good.

656
00:48:47,148 --> 00:48:48,274
Cool.

657
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:51,678
How did you get to be
such a great guitarist?

658
00:48:51,753 --> 00:48:55,689
We have never had a guitarist
like you in the group before.

659
00:48:55,857 --> 00:48:58,121
Did you start really young?

660
00:48:58,192 --> 00:49:00,319
Serious, you know you're bad.

661
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:05,126
I was in junior high school.
It was the rebel thing.

662
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,665
My parents wanted me to

663
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,602
get real educated and
become a doctor or something.

664
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:13,501
So naturally I wanted
to be a rock-and-roller.

665
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:16,174
Dude, you like to practice?
- Yes.

666
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:20,179
My dad would've loved having you
in the family. He had to force us.

667
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:21,947
We never wanted to.

668
00:49:22,016 --> 00:49:25,884
If I'd have been in your family,
then I'd be a doctor.

669
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:31,083
You want to get something to eat?

670
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:34,618
Sure.
- Yeah?

671
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:38,494
Okay. I want pizza.

672
00:49:43,971 --> 00:49:44,995
What?

673
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:47,199
You going to eat it all?
Yes.

674
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:49,169
Watch me.

675
00:49:49,243 --> 00:49:51,575
I can eat a whole medium pizza.

676
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:55,173
I love pizza.

677
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,175
I can see that.

678
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:02,350
It cracks me up when they ask me
my diet and exercise secrets. Like,

679
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,122
"How do you keep that trim figure?
Girls want to know."

680
00:50:06,194 --> 00:50:10,392
"I eat medium pizzas by myself with
lots of pepperoni. That's important.

681
00:50:10,865 --> 00:50:15,131
"And I drink Cokes and scarf Doritos
and never exercise."

682
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:19,835
You're too much.

683
00:50:26,848 --> 00:50:28,145
What're you doing?

684
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:30,207
Hot sauce.
- That is enough.

685
00:50:30,385 --> 00:50:32,410
They can't make food hot enough for me.

686
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:34,214
You are going to be sorry.

687
00:50:34,288 --> 00:50:35,414
Watch this.

688
00:50:44,298 --> 00:50:45,890
That was good.

689
00:50:47,468 --> 00:50:48,594
I need soda.

690
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:51,302
You are so tough.

691
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:53,704
You are so strong.

692
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:55,570
- What a macho man.
- Want some?

693
00:50:55,643 --> 00:50:56,632
You sure?

694
00:50:56,778 --> 00:50:57,870
- Just a little bit.
- No.

695
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:00,414
Now you gotta have half of my pizza.

696
00:51:00,481 --> 00:51:02,779
I don't like pepperoni, it's too hot.

697
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:10,457
Yeah, like that.

698
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:13,287
The song is about the flower
that lasts forever.

699
00:51:13,428 --> 00:51:17,262
Like the kind they sell at the concerts.
They're plastic and last forever.

700
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:18,992
Love is plastic?
No, dude!

701
00:51:21,669 --> 00:51:22,658
Hello!

702
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,672
I've got the new rule for this
big beautiful redone bus!

703
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:29,066
Ready?

704
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:34,449
Any food that is in this beautiful,
well-stocked little cabinet

705
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:35,783
is off-limits.

706
00:51:35,783 --> 00:51:36,809
Finished?

707
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:40,077
- That's the bus rule.
- Come on, we're brainstorming here.

708
00:51:40,154 --> 00:51:41,519
Come on, dude, play.

709
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,225
It needs some work.

710
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:54,064
Something like, "It dies."

711
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,774
What're you doing?
- Eating Suzy's chips.

712
00:52:01,843 --> 00:52:02,969
Can I have one?

713
00:52:07,114 --> 00:52:09,480
What're you doing?
- Nothing.

714
00:52:09,884 --> 00:52:11,784
You're eating my chips.

715
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:13,716
That makes them better!

716
00:52:14,188 --> 00:52:15,348
Check it out.

717
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:17,047
Pass them down!

718
00:52:18,326 --> 00:52:21,124
Anybody want a chip? You want a chip?

719
00:53:21,856 --> 00:53:24,950
Chicken enchilada.
I'm not taking orders!

720
00:53:27,428 --> 00:53:29,896
Hi, ma'am. May I help you?

721
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:32,125
Can I have...

722
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,391
<i>DJ.
Como La Flor by Selena y Los Dinos</i>

723
00:53:34,468 --> 00:53:38,768
<i>which jumped to the number one spot
on the Tejano music charts.</i>

724
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,632
Selena!

725
00:53:43,444 --> 00:53:44,877
We're Number One!

726
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:47,209
I just heard it on the radio.

727
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:48,976
No way!
You heard it?

728
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,746
We're Number One!
My God! Let's tell Dad!

729
00:53:51,819 --> 00:53:53,343
Dad, you won't believe this!

730
00:53:53,421 --> 00:53:54,752
We're Number One!

731
00:54:03,297 --> 00:54:04,594
We're Number One!

732
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:09,765
At the end of the day!

733
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:21,281
Number One! Can you believe it?

734
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:24,009
After all these years, all of a sudden, bang!

735
00:54:24,118 --> 00:54:28,987
That's how it is, I tell you.
You start from here, then it's like a bullet.

736
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,787
Abie's really smart.
He really knows his cumbia rhythms.

737
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:36,523
He adds a little funk and disco.
Then you sing the heck out of it.

738
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:40,624
You add a little heavy metal to the guitar.
- I can do that.

739
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:44,527
Dude, I was just thinking.
I've never seen you dance.

740
00:54:44,872 --> 00:54:46,464
Do you dance?

741
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,632
Dance?

742
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:50,136
Yeah, I dance.

743
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:53,873
I put on my white shoes and black jacket
and dance like Travolta.

744
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:57,114
Yeah, we can dance to this.
Let me see you dance.

745
00:54:57,418 --> 00:54:58,817
I was just kidding.

746
00:54:58,953 --> 00:55:02,411
Come on, let me see you dance.
Don't be shy.

747
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:05,423
I won't tell anyone
that you weren't being cool.

748
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:08,255
You get them disgruntled...
- They're always disgruntled.

749
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:12,822
I'll be making a pit stop
in about five more minutes.

750
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:15,264
Follow me.
- Give me a little James Brown.

751
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:19,433
I got soul.

752
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:20,835
Do you?

753
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:26,508
You banged me.
- I'm sorry.

754
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:31,308
Come on, this is a cumbia rhythm.
I've never seen you dance...

755
00:55:43,698 --> 00:55:47,190
Wait. I don't think we should be doing this.

756
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:50,760
I'm not sure we should either.

757
00:56:09,323 --> 00:56:10,722
I'm sorry.

758
00:56:14,528 --> 00:56:16,689
Is he gone?
- Yep.

759
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,730
Do you think he'll tell?

760
00:56:23,104 --> 00:56:24,571
I don't think so.

761
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:31,571
That sounds good, dude.

762
00:56:31,746 --> 00:56:33,145
Thanks, man.

763
00:56:33,514 --> 00:56:34,947
Want a beer?
- Sure.

764
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,572
All right.

765
00:56:37,384 --> 00:56:39,579
Don't worry about it. I won't say anything.

766
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,120
I know you're cool, man.

767
00:56:41,188 --> 00:56:43,349
If it gets serious, there'll be trouble.

768
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:47,583
Abraham won't like Selena
getting serious with a guy now.

769
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:49,395
With a guy like you.

770
00:56:49,997 --> 00:56:51,760
What do you mean, a guy like me?

771
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:56,398
Dude, you're my boy, right?
We're cool? But we're musicians.

772
00:56:56,971 --> 00:56:58,836
We both know what you're like.

773
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,007
And Selena, she's like

774
00:57:01,142 --> 00:57:02,404
a sister to me.

775
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:08,675
I don't know.

776
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:10,507
It's different with her.

777
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:13,513
She makes me feel different.

778
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,745
I don't know what it is. I can't explain it.

779
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:20,980
Mom, he is so cute.

780
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:24,557
I don't know what it is.
He just makes me feel

781
00:57:24,762 --> 00:57:25,888
different.

782
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:28,988
Like, I get butterflies
when I think about him.

783
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:33,393
Girl, I could tell you like him.

784
00:57:33,771 --> 00:57:37,104
And you know what?
I think he's cute, too.

785
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:40,539
Mom, he is so funny.

786
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:41,769
He hardly talks.

787
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:44,973
No, you have to get to know him.
I'm serious.

788
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:49,245
When we're together,
we just laugh and laugh at stupid things.

789
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:51,047
You can't tell Dad.

790
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:52,622
Don't worry.

791
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,917
I was a young girl, too, remember?

792
00:57:55,593 --> 00:57:56,821
You promise?

793
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:59,021
I won't tell.

794
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:04,633
Now get off the bed.
You're messing up my pillow.

795
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,671
They want us to play in Mexico?

796
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:13,436
A gig in Monterrey, Mexico!
- That would be so cool.

797
00:58:13,544 --> 00:58:15,205
I'm not sure of that.

798
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:16,404
Come on, Dad.

799
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,414
You always said everything's a risk.

800
00:58:18,482 --> 00:58:20,609
They don't accept us there. Never have.

801
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:21,742
We're Mexican!

802
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:25,016
No, we're Mexican-American
and they don't like Mexican-Americans.

803
00:58:25,155 --> 00:58:27,817
And they can be mean and
they can tear us apart there.

804
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:29,688
And Selena's Spanish is...

805
00:58:29,827 --> 00:58:31,385
What about it?

806
00:58:31,462 --> 00:58:34,556
I've been singing in Spanish
for 10 years. It's perfect.

807
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:37,663
Singing, yes.
But you speak it a little funny.

808
00:58:37,835 --> 00:58:41,498
There you must speak perfectly
or the press will eat you alive.

809
00:58:41,705 --> 00:58:43,036
I've seen them do it.

810
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:46,233
Overreacting as usual.
- The music will speak for itself.

811
00:58:46,677 --> 00:58:48,770
Being Mexican-American is tough.

812
00:58:49,246 --> 00:58:52,875
Anglos jump all over you
if you don't speak English perfectly.

813
00:58:53,017 --> 00:58:56,180
Mexicans jump all over you
if you don't speak Spanish perfectly.

814
00:58:56,253 --> 00:58:58,585
We must be twice as perfect
as anybody else.

815
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,221
Why're you laughing?

816
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:02,691
What's so funny?
- Nothing.

817
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,293
I'm serious.

818
00:59:04,662 --> 00:59:07,062
Our family has been here for centuries.

819
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:10,462
Yet they treat us as if we just
swam across the Rio Grande.

820
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:13,860
We must know about
John Wayne and Pedro Infante.

821
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:17,639
We must know about
Frank Sinatra and Agustin Lara.

822
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,233
We must know about Oprah and Cristina.

823
00:59:20,678 --> 00:59:22,703
Anglo food is too bland.

824
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,644
And yet, in Mexico we get the runs.

825
00:59:24,715 --> 00:59:26,808
Now that, to me, is embarrassing.

826
00:59:26,884 --> 00:59:30,081
Japanese-Americans, Italian-Americans,
German-Americans...

827
00:59:30,154 --> 00:59:32,622
Their homeland is across the ocean.

828
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,816
Ours

829
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:36,291
is right next door. Right over there.

830
00:59:36,427 --> 00:59:39,294
We must prove to the Mexicans
how Mexican we are.

831
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:41,364
Prove to the Americans we're American.

832
00:59:41,465 --> 00:59:44,923
We must be more Mexican than Mexicans,
more American than Americans,

833
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:47,936
both at the same time! It's exhausting.

834
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:49,699
Damn!

835
00:59:49,773 --> 00:59:53,004
Nobody knows how tough it is
to be Mexican-American.

836
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:58,645
<i>It's a good thing we have frijoles
and tortillas to keep our strength up.</i>

837
00:59:58,716 --> 01:00:02,243
<i>Now you're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not! And menudo.</i>

838
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,649
Now you're making me hungry.

839
01:00:04,722 --> 01:00:06,383
Come on, Dad.

840
01:00:06,724 --> 01:00:08,919
I can do it. I know I can. Really.

841
01:00:09,393 --> 01:00:11,486
Trust us.
- Listen, guys.

842
01:00:11,962 --> 01:00:15,261
Let's finish the tour in California
and then we'll talk about it.

843
01:00:15,466 --> 01:00:18,697
But being Mexican-American
is really hard.

844
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:51,928
Security!

845
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,335
What's going on in here?

846
01:01:09,653 --> 01:01:13,248
We'll pay for everything,
and I do mean everything.

847
01:01:13,624 --> 01:01:16,787
You think that'll make it right?
- No.

848
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:20,429
You do this everywhere you go?

849
01:01:28,439 --> 01:01:30,873
He's fired. I never want to see him again.

850
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:34,341
You can't do that.
- We're not a disgusting punk rock group!

851
01:01:34,878 --> 01:01:36,641
I know that, Dad! Look, trust me!

852
01:01:36,747 --> 01:01:38,374
Where is he?
I don't know.

853
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:40,383
He's fired!
You can't.

854
01:01:40,451 --> 01:01:43,352
We're going to Mexico.
- I don't want to see his face again.

855
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,548
There's no way we're going to find
a new guitarist before then.

856
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,352
It's impossible.

857
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:50,157
Chris!

858
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,027
What was that all about?

859
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:56,666
What's with you, huh?

860
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:59,501
Why are you trying to spoil everything?

861
01:02:00,237 --> 01:02:02,034
I'm no good for you.

862
01:02:02,206 --> 01:02:03,833
It'll never work.

863
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:08,741
I wish everyone would stop telling me
what's good for me!

864
01:02:08,912 --> 01:02:12,609
I gotta hear it from Dad, Mom, Abie,
and now you?

865
01:02:12,749 --> 01:02:16,515
Maybe you should listen to them.
- Stop telling me what I should want!

866
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,851
You don't know who I really am!
You don't know anything about me!

867
01:02:19,923 --> 01:02:21,447
And that's you up there?

868
01:02:21,525 --> 01:02:24,926
Big hot-shot rock-and-roller,
got to trash hotel rooms?

869
01:02:25,929 --> 01:02:29,763
I've been around musicians all my life.
I'm not impressed.

870
01:02:32,102 --> 01:02:34,263
And I do know who you are.

871
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:39,469
I can see you.

872
01:02:42,112 --> 01:02:43,943
You're just Chris.

873
01:02:45,749 --> 01:02:48,582
I want it to work, okay? But it just...
- But what?

874
01:02:49,553 --> 01:02:51,646
You know what your problem is?

875
01:02:53,257 --> 01:02:57,125
You can't accept something great
even when it stares you in the face.

876
01:02:58,128 --> 01:03:00,653
I may not be streetwise and all that.

877
01:03:01,899 --> 01:03:04,527
But at least I know not to be that dumb!

878
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,924
Her Spanish.

879
01:03:44,808 --> 01:03:47,436
If only she could just keep singing!

880
01:03:48,312 --> 01:03:51,713
When we get out there,
let me do all the talking, okay?

881
01:03:51,782 --> 01:03:55,013
Let me handle this. Okay? I've got an idea.

882
01:04:46,403 --> 01:04:47,802
...excited!

883
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,556
Are they shouting for me?

884
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:14,497
They are shouting for you.

885
01:05:16,137 --> 01:05:18,264
- M'hija, you going to wear your jacket?
- No, no.

886
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:21,103
Have a good show.

887
01:05:21,509 --> 01:05:23,841
There's over 100,000 people here.

888
01:05:23,912 --> 01:05:27,313
- We were expecting 10,000.
- Order extra security people this minute.

889
01:05:27,448 --> 01:05:29,279
They're going onstage already.

890
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:35,881
The police are sending extra help.

891
01:05:35,957 --> 01:05:38,289
We were not prepared
for a crowd this big.

892
01:05:38,493 --> 01:05:40,290
I've never seen
anything like it.

893
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,729
That's enough!
Stop! Get off!

894
01:07:57,899 --> 01:08:00,629
Everybody, get
off! This is crazy!

895
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:08,467
Are you okay?
- The stage was collapsing!

896
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,843
They're pushing the stage!
- It's out of control.

897
01:08:13,614 --> 01:08:15,946
It is too dangerous.
The stage'll crack.

898
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,540
You can't stop the concert.

899
01:08:17,652 --> 01:08:19,643
I won't let them
play if this will happen!

900
01:08:21,255 --> 01:08:23,450
Lt'll cause a riot!
They're my kids!

901
01:08:23,591 --> 01:08:24,819
They're in danger!

902
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,630
We need you to settle
this crowd down. Can you do it?

903
01:08:42,477 --> 01:08:44,308
Yeah.
Are you sure?

904
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:48,273
Yeah, I can do it.

905
01:08:49,784 --> 01:08:52,275
Get out there.
Quickly. Come on.

906
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,951
<i>Let's do Como La Flor.</i>

907
01:08:58,159 --> 01:08:59,649
But start it slow.

908
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,455
You got it.

909
01:12:23,898 --> 01:12:25,195
Front page!

910
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:28,291
We're on so many covers!
- You said we couldn't do it!

911
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:30,963
What is Dad doing?
Listen to this.

912
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,963
"Selena is the
genuine artist of the people."

913
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,004
You're an artist!

914
01:12:45,519 --> 01:12:47,885
I've never seen
so many people before.

915
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,891
I've never been scared by a crowd,
not even when I was nine.

916
01:12:53,027 --> 01:12:55,825
But then you started to sing
and they all loved you.

917
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,304
Sometimes I think about

918
01:13:04,438 --> 01:13:06,338
the things I never had.

919
01:13:08,309 --> 01:13:10,777
I never had a
normal childhood.

920
01:13:10,945 --> 01:13:13,505
I finished high
school by mail.

921
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:18,917
Spent more time in Big Bertha
than I have anywhere else.

922
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:23,018
But when I was on that stage

923
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:27,524
it was like nothing
I ever felt before.

924
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,522
It's hard to describe.
I just had this feeling like

925
01:13:34,135 --> 01:13:35,329
my dreams

926
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:39,735
were the same as the dreams
of all those people in the audience.

927
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:43,207
Like all their hopes
were centered on me.

928
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,204
And I just felt lucky.

929
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:52,750
I felt really lucky.

930
01:13:55,856 --> 01:13:57,653
I know why they
love you so much.

931
01:13:57,858 --> 01:13:59,689
Oh, yeah? Why?

932
01:14:02,863 --> 01:14:04,558
Because I love you, too.

933
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:08,029
I mean it.

934
01:14:08,369 --> 01:14:12,032
You're my best friend. I can talk
about anything and you understand.

935
01:14:13,474 --> 01:14:15,874
I've thought a lot about
what you said to me

936
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:18,240
that night in
L.A. By the dumpsters.

937
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,245
I don't want to be that dumb.

938
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,076
I don't want to lose you.

939
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:27,053
I don't want to
lose you either.

940
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:31,186
When I was five years old
and my parents split up

941
01:14:33,227 --> 01:14:37,186
every day I've remembered
the feeling I had when I knew

942
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,095
my father wasn't coming back.

943
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:42,596
Until I met you.

944
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:45,402
I don't feel like that anymore.

945
01:14:48,409 --> 01:14:49,740
I love you.

946
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,101
I love you, too.

947
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,503
Oh, I'm sorry.

948
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,443
I have a surprise for you.

949
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,483
You do?
- Want to see it?

950
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,855
Hold on! Wait for me.

951
01:15:58,812 --> 01:16:01,178
Okay. Everybody off the bus.

952
01:16:01,282 --> 01:16:03,409
What's going on?
Off the bus.

953
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:04,575
Get off!

954
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,880
You, stay in.
You, stay in. Get off.

955
01:16:09,089 --> 01:16:11,387
This is over, right now.
- What do you mean?

956
01:16:11,492 --> 01:16:14,017
This. You and
him. It's over.

957
01:16:14,128 --> 01:16:17,291
You can't tell us what to do.
- I can tell you anything I want.

958
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,524
I know who you are.

959
01:16:18,599 --> 01:16:21,727
I come from the streets.
I know what a bum musician is.

960
01:16:21,835 --> 01:16:23,359
Don't talk to
him like that!

961
01:16:23,437 --> 01:16:26,099
I can say anything
I want to say to him!

962
01:16:26,507 --> 01:16:28,498
I won't have this in my family.

963
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,510
Let's get this straight.

964
01:16:30,578 --> 01:16:32,910
You're not to see each other
like this again.

965
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,572
I'm not agreeing to anything.

966
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,945
You can't tell me
who I can and can't...

967
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,450
You wait!

968
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:43,114
You'll ruin your career and your life!
You're 20! Give yourself time!

969
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:47,024
I don't care what you say!
It doesn't matter! I love him!

970
01:16:47,461 --> 01:16:48,621
What did you say?

971
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:50,321
I said

972
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:51,728
I love him.

973
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:53,392
And he loves me.

974
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:54,966
Of course he does!

975
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,435
You're young, you're
beautiful and you're rich!

976
01:16:57,538 --> 01:16:59,369
You would say that!

977
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,370
It's not like that!

978
01:17:02,042 --> 01:17:03,942
He cares about me.

979
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,738
The real me.

980
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:07,873
Inside!

981
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,246
There is no way

982
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,749
I'll let you take that away.

983
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:15,450
We're not going to
stop seeing each other.

984
01:17:15,556 --> 01:17:17,148
You listen to me!

985
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,386
If you think I'll allow you
to mess up my family

986
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:22,952
ruin everything we've
worked for, you're wrong!

987
01:17:23,063 --> 01:17:25,793
I respect your family.
I don't want to ruin anything.

988
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:27,890
I love Selena and we
want to get married.

989
01:17:33,807 --> 01:17:35,775
That's right. We
want to get married.

990
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:40,273
That's it!

991
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:41,639
You're fired!

992
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,079
Do you hear me?

993
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:46,081
You can ride back home,
but after that you're fired!

994
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:48,285
I can make my own way.

995
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,514
You cannot do this, Dad!

996
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:54,287
I'm not going to let
you do this! Let me go!

997
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,194
Listen to me.

998
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:57,795
You all listen to me!

999
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,791
If you follow that man,
I will disband the group!

1000
01:18:02,002 --> 01:18:04,300
There will be no
more Selena y Los Dinos.

1001
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:06,038
Do you understand me?

1002
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,101
Do you all understand me?

1003
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:10,802
It's over!

1004
01:18:17,885 --> 01:18:19,216
It's okay.

1005
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:24,215
<i>Mija, but your father is right.</i>

1006
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,619
You're too young to get married.

1007
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:30,524
You and Dad were just as young
when you got married. Younger.

1008
01:18:31,632 --> 01:18:34,123
It was different
back then, Selena.

1009
01:18:34,301 --> 01:18:36,030
What was so different?

1010
01:18:36,236 --> 01:18:40,297
I was the daughter of poor farm
workers. We didn't have any choices.

1011
01:18:40,474 --> 01:18:43,034
In those days
there was no other way.

1012
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:49,113
But you and Dad have been happy, right?
- Yes. Yes.

1013
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,850
I love your father very much.

1014
01:18:52,653 --> 01:18:55,315
But I wanted something
different for my daughters.

1015
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:58,354
A chance to see things.

1016
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,083
<i>To live, mija.</i>

1017
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:04,128
<i>Look, mija, just
wait a few years, okay?</i>

1018
01:19:05,065 --> 01:19:07,533
I know it seems
like forever to you now.

1019
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:10,665
But believe me,
it's the right thing.

1020
01:19:12,072 --> 01:19:13,869
But I love him, Mom.

1021
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:18,536
I love him.

1022
01:19:22,082 --> 01:19:23,344
It's okay.

1023
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:42,635
Selena!
- Selena, Selena!

1024
01:19:54,948 --> 01:19:56,006
I hate this.

1025
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,413
Can't even go
to a burger joint

1026
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:02,351
without worrying about someone
seeing us and it getting back to Dad.

1027
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:05,118
Pass the hot sauce.
It's in the glove compartment.

1028
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,584
Don't worry about
it. Just give it time.

1029
01:20:08,729 --> 01:20:10,253
Where are you going next?

1030
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:11,590
I don't know.

1031
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:14,924
El Paso tomorrow. Some big gig.

1032
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:18,037
They keep me busy
between gigs, too.

1033
01:20:18,138 --> 01:20:20,732
Today I have to go to
the waterpark with Sara.

1034
01:20:20,974 --> 01:20:23,534
I had to talk fast
just to go shopping alone.

1035
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,134
And you're here with me.

1036
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:31,941
He says he'll break up the band
if we keep seeing each other.

1037
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:34,353
So what? I can
do other things.

1038
01:20:35,589 --> 01:20:36,886
I can design clothes.

1039
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:38,617
I've always wanted to do that.

1040
01:20:39,092 --> 01:20:40,957
You don't want
to quit music.

1041
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:43,823
No.

1042
01:20:44,097 --> 01:20:46,588
Making it to the big time
is important to you.

1043
01:20:49,002 --> 01:20:53,098
I mean, being big in Mexico and doing
that whole English crossover thing.

1044
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:58,075
You once felt like everyone's hopes
and dreams were centered on you.

1045
01:20:58,445 --> 01:20:59,810
It means a lot
to you, right?

1046
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:01,974
It does.

1047
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,580
What if they're right?

1048
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,582
About us getting married.

1049
01:21:07,788 --> 01:21:11,315
They feel like it's going
to hurt the act, not just Abraham.

1050
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:14,255
Abie, Ricky, Pete, Joe, Suzy.

1051
01:21:14,795 --> 01:21:16,126
They all think that.

1052
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:33,405
Let's do that
Velcro thing over there.

1053
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:36,481
Want to go on that?
The spider web thing?

1054
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,677
That one there.
- Yeah! That's cool!

1055
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:40,218
We can all do it together.

1056
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,651
How about that?

1057
01:21:44,124 --> 01:21:46,354
Sel, you're so full of it.

1058
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,826
You wouldn't do that.
Dare me.

1059
01:21:48,896 --> 01:21:50,830
I dare you.
Don't dare her!

1060
01:21:50,898 --> 01:21:53,230
Wait! I was just
kidding! I'm going!

1061
01:21:53,901 --> 01:21:55,061
Sel, wait a second!

1062
01:21:55,168 --> 01:21:56,430
What're you doing?

1063
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:57,901
Shouldn't have dared me.

1064
01:21:59,573 --> 01:22:00,665
Get off!

1065
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:02,971
Come on! Have
you lost your mind?

1066
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:04,834
This isn't funny!

1067
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:06,171
Come down!

1068
01:22:06,346 --> 01:22:07,836
What're you doing?

1069
01:22:08,148 --> 01:22:09,513
See you later.

1070
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:11,242
Nobody's laughing!

1071
01:22:11,351 --> 01:22:12,841
Get down here!

1072
01:22:27,701 --> 01:22:30,067
If you look down, you won't do it.

1073
01:22:30,871 --> 01:22:31,895
Step back.

1074
01:22:33,173 --> 01:22:35,869
Right hand on the side.
Left hand on the other side.

1075
01:22:39,346 --> 01:22:41,712
Come on. The hardest part is letting go.

1076
01:23:12,045 --> 01:23:14,104
What're you doing here?
- I've had it!

1077
01:23:14,181 --> 01:23:16,149
I've had it! I
can't take it anymore!

1078
01:23:16,249 --> 01:23:19,309
El Paso is 12 hours away.
You should be getting on the bus.

1079
01:23:19,419 --> 01:23:22,752
I don't care! You mean more to me
than any gig in El Paso!

1080
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:25,656
Your father'll know that you're here.
- Let him know!

1081
01:23:25,759 --> 01:23:29,525
Let him! Okay? I'm
tired of hiding from him.

1082
01:23:29,596 --> 01:23:32,793
I'm tired, too. But everything's
going to get messed up this way.

1083
01:23:32,933 --> 01:23:34,628
Can't you just hold me?

1084
01:23:37,537 --> 01:23:40,267
I don't want it messed up.
- Do you want to be with me?

1085
01:23:42,409 --> 01:23:43,774
Of course I do.

1086
01:23:43,844 --> 01:23:45,937
Do you want to
be with me forever?

1087
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,175
Forever. You're it for me.

1088
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:52,750
Let's do it. Let's get married now.

1089
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,951
Married?

1090
01:23:55,288 --> 01:23:56,687
That's crazy.

1091
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:59,553
You don't want to marry me?
- Of course I want to.

1092
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,850
But the right way.

1093
01:24:01,962 --> 01:24:03,361
What's that?

1094
01:24:03,463 --> 01:24:06,261
With you wearing a
beautiful white dress

1095
01:24:06,366 --> 01:24:09,164
and your friends
in those different

1096
01:24:09,703 --> 01:24:11,000
colored dresses.

1097
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:12,799
Bridesmaids, Chris.

1098
01:24:12,873 --> 01:24:16,969
Yeah, bridesmaids and lots
of flowers and your family.

1099
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:20,203
I don't care about all that!
It's not the important thing!

1100
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:24,578
I know it's important to you to have
your family at your wedding.

1101
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:28,452
And it's important to me, too.
Because I care for you.

1102
01:24:39,332 --> 01:24:40,822
You're right.

1103
01:24:45,839 --> 01:24:47,602
I would love that.

1104
01:24:50,677 --> 01:24:52,508
To have a big wedding.

1105
01:24:55,615 --> 01:24:57,674
And my dad give me away.

1106
01:24:58,685 --> 01:25:00,915
That would mean more to me
than anything.

1107
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,920
But it's never
going to happen.

1108
01:25:06,426 --> 01:25:08,018
I know him, Chris.

1109
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,093
I know what he's like.

1110
01:25:10,864 --> 01:25:13,765
And he will never
accept us! Never!

1111
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:17,532
All right? He's dug
his heels in and that's it.

1112
01:25:18,038 --> 01:25:22,975
The whole worid, all Corpus Christi could
tumble down and he wouldn't budge!

1113
01:25:24,478 --> 01:25:28,244
The only way he will know
I am not going to give you up

1114
01:25:29,049 --> 01:25:31,745
is if we go out and
get married right now.

1115
01:25:34,321 --> 01:25:36,050
Then he'll have to accept us.

1116
01:25:37,657 --> 01:25:39,454
But what if he doesn't?

1117
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,084
I'll still have you.

1118
01:25:44,164 --> 01:25:45,927
And you'll have me.

1119
01:25:49,503 --> 01:25:52,472
And there's no gig in the worid
more important than that.

1120
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:57,169
I love you.

1121
01:26:01,681 --> 01:26:02,943
Let's get married.

1122
01:26:04,651 --> 01:26:06,516
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1123
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,958
How does it feel to be married?
- It feels great.

1124
01:26:15,095 --> 01:26:16,392
I like it.

1125
01:26:19,432 --> 01:26:23,198
But it also feels like I don't know
what we got ourselves into.

1126
01:26:24,371 --> 01:26:26,566
Look, don't worry. Okay?

1127
01:26:26,806 --> 01:26:30,572
You don't know what it's like
to be a Quintanilla. We're tight.

1128
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:32,205
Like this.

1129
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,305
And I'll talk to my dad.

1130
01:26:38,118 --> 01:26:40,916
I'll find the right
way to tell him. Okay?

1131
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:45,313
Okay, Sel, but listen.

1132
01:26:45,392 --> 01:26:48,919
Just in case things are not okay,
I can take care of you.

1133
01:26:49,129 --> 01:26:53,589
I can make up to $400 a week doing
sessión work, and bands want me.

1134
01:26:54,267 --> 01:26:55,632
I can take care of you.

1135
01:26:57,771 --> 01:26:59,136
I love you.

1136
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:02,164
See? That's my
macho man talking!

1137
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:06,170
I love you, too!
I love you!

1138
01:27:06,746 --> 01:27:08,270
Lt'll be okay.

1139
01:27:08,381 --> 01:27:11,612
<i>DJ. Here's some
late-breaking news for you Selena fans.</i>

1140
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:14,345
<i>We have found out
Selena got married today</i>

1141
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:17,288
<i>to the lead guitarist
from her group, The Dinos.</i>

1142
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:19,585
<i>Selena and Chris
Perez tied the knot.</i>

1143
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:23,026
<i>Here's a great big
congratulations to the happy couple.</i>

1144
01:27:23,163 --> 01:27:25,427
It's on the radio already.

1145
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,169
Don't go to Corpus! Go the other way!

1146
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:33,433
Where will we go, Alaska?
Anywhere but Corpus!

1147
01:27:34,975 --> 01:27:37,034
We just have to
give him a day.

1148
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,871
I know my dad.

1149
01:27:40,447 --> 01:27:41,778
Tomorrow.

1150
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,647
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1151
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,603
Wait here.

1152
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:08,999
Good luck.

1153
01:28:26,526 --> 01:28:28,551
Dad, I know you're angry.

1154
01:28:28,662 --> 01:28:29,822
Come in.

1155
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,825
Sit down and shut the door.

1156
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:44,840
When I found out yesterday
what you had done

1157
01:28:46,346 --> 01:28:48,246
I went crazy.

1158
01:28:48,848 --> 01:28:50,645
I didn't know what to do.

1159
01:28:50,717 --> 01:28:55,086
I went for a walk on the beach to where
I took you when you were a little girl.

1160
01:28:55,855 --> 01:28:57,254
I remember.

1161
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,694
I sat there for hours and
I cried. I cried like a baby.

1162
01:29:06,766 --> 01:29:08,461
Dad, I didn't mean to...

1163
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:10,393
Listen.

1164
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:14,735
This might sound
a little strange, but...

1165
01:29:19,579 --> 01:29:21,274
I'm glad you did it.

1166
01:29:21,681 --> 01:29:24,309
It was a great
weight on my shoulders.

1167
01:29:26,786 --> 01:29:28,413
I forced you into it.

1168
01:29:28,521 --> 01:29:30,148
No, you didn't.
- Listen.

1169
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:32,087
I can be stubborn.

1170
01:29:33,293 --> 01:29:35,557
You did what you had to do.

1171
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:37,986
But I wanted what
was best for you.

1172
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:40,832
I know that.

1173
01:29:43,103 --> 01:29:45,970
I think that's why I knew
it was going to be okay.

1174
01:29:46,806 --> 01:29:49,297
You know that
day on the bus when

1175
01:29:49,576 --> 01:29:51,168
Chris said he loved you?

1176
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:52,739
Yeah.

1177
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,009
I know he meant it.

1178
01:29:58,251 --> 01:29:59,616
He did mean it.

1179
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:03,987
We both love each other very much.

1180
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:05,991
But it scared me.

1181
01:30:07,327 --> 01:30:09,454
I don't know how to let you go.

1182
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:11,390
Dad.

1183
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,163
I just want you to be happy.

1184
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:18,631
I love you, Dad.

1185
01:30:20,774 --> 01:30:21,934
Chris!

1186
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:30,811
We don't need
the getaway car?

1187
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,875
Everything's cool?
Everything's good.

1188
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:36,351
Come here!

1189
01:30:36,423 --> 01:30:38,391
Welcome to the family!

1190
01:30:38,825 --> 01:30:40,349
Hey, brother-in-law!

1191
01:30:40,627 --> 01:30:42,151
You're stuck with us.

1192
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:44,757
Congratulations.
Thanks.

1193
01:30:45,498 --> 01:30:47,363
You take care of my sis.

1194
01:30:47,434 --> 01:30:49,163
You know it.
- I know.

1195
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,232
Y'all know we got a
gig tonight in San Antonio.

1196
01:30:53,506 --> 01:30:55,838
Get on the bus
or we'll miss it.

1197
01:30:56,009 --> 01:30:58,807
And you all know
how I hate to cancel gigs.

1198
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:03,175
Chris, you got your guitar?

1199
01:31:04,818 --> 01:31:06,183
Yes, I do.

1200
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:08,653
Come here, son.

1201
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:12,881
You're a good man.

1202
01:31:14,861 --> 01:31:16,658
Welcome to our family.

1203
01:31:21,868 --> 01:31:25,326
Did it really happen? Are we here?
- We're here.

1204
01:31:25,472 --> 01:31:27,463
Married? And it's
okay with everybody?

1205
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,800
We did it.

1206
01:31:29,809 --> 01:31:31,743
I feel like I
could do anything.

1207
01:31:31,878 --> 01:31:33,869
I want the whole worid

1208
01:31:34,013 --> 01:31:37,005
dancing to my music
and wearing my clothes!

1209
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:38,874
Then that's what'll happen.

1210
01:31:39,018 --> 01:31:42,010
Guaranteed. Pretty soon,
everybody'll look like Selena.

1211
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:47,157
For the first time in my life,
I swear, I feel like I'm free.

1212
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,820
Like I could fly if I wanted to.

1213
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,721
Like I am flying.

1214
01:35:42,128 --> 01:35:43,493
She's taking off.

1215
01:35:43,663 --> 01:35:47,326
And now with this Grammy
nomination, she's like a rocket.

1216
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:49,328
She's very happy.

1217
01:35:49,669 --> 01:35:51,398
The happiest she's ever been.

1218
01:35:57,110 --> 01:36:01,171
We're happy, too. Record
sales have been phenomenal.

1219
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,807
She's fantastic. I think
she's the next Gloria Estefan.

1220
01:36:09,822 --> 01:36:12,689
We want to make a
major English-language album.

1221
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,351
English-language album?

1222
01:36:16,529 --> 01:36:17,996
A crossover album.

1223
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:20,631
The best producers.
The best songwriters.

1224
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,791
Everything first-class.

1225
01:36:23,636 --> 01:36:24,694
Is she ready?

1226
01:36:25,438 --> 01:36:27,429
There'll be major promotion.

1227
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,201
She'll be on all the shows.

1228
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:31,434
Leno, Letterman, everything.

1229
01:36:46,325 --> 01:36:47,792
She's ready.

1230
01:36:50,496 --> 01:36:52,828
We've been ready
for a long time.

1231
01:37:04,216 --> 01:37:06,480
<i>How do you feel, Selena?</i>

1232
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:10,315
<i>I am so proud. We've been
working so hard for this day.</i>

1233
01:37:10,388 --> 01:37:12,185
<i>I want to introduce you to Martin.</i>

1234
01:37:12,324 --> 01:37:14,485
<i>He's the designer I work with.</i>

1235
01:37:16,795 --> 01:37:20,526
<i>And Yolanda Saldivar. She's been
handling the business end for me.</i>

1236
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:24,132
<i>She's my fan-club president.</i>

1237
01:37:24,202 --> 01:37:25,829
<i>It's like a dream come true.</i>

1238
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:27,802
So, let's do it!

1239
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:33,978
<i>Come on in and
I'll give you a tour.</i>

1240
01:37:34,346 --> 01:37:37,577
So, do you have the sandblaster
to work on her feet?

1241
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,011
Sign right here.

1242
01:37:40,152 --> 01:37:42,052
- What is that?
- Just some inventory stuff.

1243
01:37:42,154 --> 01:37:43,212
- Sign this.
- Oh, it tickles.

1244
01:37:43,355 --> 01:37:44,788
Stop wiggling.

1245
01:37:44,856 --> 01:37:45,948
It'll smear.

1246
01:37:46,024 --> 01:37:48,185
Yolanda, from now on your toes
are going to look good, girl.

1247
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:50,820
But I don't deserve this.
Nobody cares about my toes!

1248
01:37:50,929 --> 01:37:52,988
I care about your toes!

1249
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:56,029
Everybody who works for me
gets a pedicure every week.

1250
01:37:56,168 --> 01:37:57,362
That's the rule.

1251
01:37:57,435 --> 01:37:59,232
Your feet look like irons.

1252
01:38:00,038 --> 01:38:02,768
All we need is a shirt.
A wrinkled shirt.

1253
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:04,570
What're you doing here?

1254
01:38:04,643 --> 01:38:06,474
Give me another one!

1255
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:08,544
You like this color?

1256
01:38:08,613 --> 01:38:11,411
It's pretty. I like it.
Why are you here so early?

1257
01:38:11,483 --> 01:38:14,850
I came to tell you Pete can't
make it to L.A. For the Grammys.

1258
01:38:14,953 --> 01:38:16,045
Why?

1259
01:38:16,154 --> 01:38:18,213
Hi, Chris.
- Hey, what's up?

1260
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:22,192
He said he has a
family thing, I don't know.

1261
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:23,852
Now we have a
spare ticket.

1262
01:38:24,262 --> 01:38:26,355
Is that the same thing?
- Yeah, it is.

1263
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:30,027
What're you doing today?
- About 5,000 things.

1264
01:38:30,101 --> 01:38:31,693
Forget them and do 5,001.

1265
01:38:31,803 --> 01:38:33,270
Come to L.A.

1266
01:38:33,505 --> 01:38:34,563
L. A?

1267
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,266
Please!
- And do what?

1268
01:38:36,408 --> 01:38:38,638
Movie stars, rock
stars, free drinks.

1269
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:40,607
Free food.
- You're crazy.

1270
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:43,409
I can't, I must do
inventory. Don't worry.

1271
01:38:43,481 --> 01:38:45,073
I can do it.

1272
01:38:45,217 --> 01:38:48,778
I know where the lists are.
I know what needs to be done.

1273
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:50,616
You go with Selena. Go!

1274
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:52,714
Come on.
- I have nothing to wear.

1275
01:38:53,058 --> 01:38:56,824
Then we're just going to have
to go shopping! Come on!

1276
01:38:56,895 --> 01:38:59,090
<i>REENIE. You know
Andy Garcia 'll be there?</i>

1277
01:38:59,431 --> 01:39:01,626
<i>REENIE. He's so sexy!
SELENA. I'll bring my camera!</i>

1278
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:04,430
We have to hurry. We don't have
that much more time.

1279
01:39:04,502 --> 01:39:07,266
How much time do we have left?
- Three hours.

1280
01:39:07,339 --> 01:39:08,533
Are you nervous?

1281
01:39:08,707 --> 01:39:09,696
Little bit.

1282
01:39:10,108 --> 01:39:11,666
I think you're going to win.

1283
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:14,135
Get out!
- I do. I do.

1284
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:16,710
Doesn't matter
if I win or not.

1285
01:39:17,015 --> 01:39:19,506
Dude! But I hope I do!

1286
01:39:21,686 --> 01:39:24,018
There's a store
with nice dresses.

1287
01:39:24,155 --> 01:39:26,919
That's a pretty place, too.
- Let's check there.

1288
01:39:27,626 --> 01:39:30,686
Look at that one.
See that one in the middle?

1289
01:39:32,664 --> 01:39:34,495
We could find
something in here.

1290
01:39:35,567 --> 01:39:36,693
Look.

1291
01:39:37,636 --> 01:39:39,160
Every bridesmaid's nightmare.

1292
01:39:39,671 --> 01:39:41,138
Looks like a suit of armor.

1293
01:39:42,173 --> 01:39:43,731
It's very Minnie Pearl.

1294
01:39:45,176 --> 01:39:47,474
Now, this is nice.

1295
01:39:47,779 --> 01:39:48,939
What do you think?

1296
01:39:49,047 --> 01:39:50,947
Where will I get
the boobs for that?

1297
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:53,110
True.

1298
01:39:54,286 --> 01:39:55,947
I'm kidding.

1299
01:39:58,356 --> 01:40:01,883
You like this? This is nice.
- It's pretty. I like the color.

1300
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:04,360
Excuse me, can
we try this on?

1301
01:40:04,496 --> 01:40:06,521
You won't be interested in that one.

1302
01:40:07,465 --> 01:40:08,523
Why?

1303
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,059
Because that dress is $800.

1304
01:40:12,537 --> 01:40:15,370
Can you take if off the mannequin?
We'd like to try it on.

1305
01:40:21,012 --> 01:40:23,003
I want it to fit.

1306
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:27,076
Suck it in!
I'm trying!

1307
01:40:27,485 --> 01:40:29,316
We'll get you a girdle.

1308
01:40:29,387 --> 01:40:31,355
It is too tight!
It is not!

1309
01:40:31,423 --> 01:40:32,685
Selena?

1310
01:40:34,726 --> 01:40:35,750
Hi.

1311
01:40:46,938 --> 01:40:48,929
Selena's here.
- Where?

1312
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,530
Selena's in the mall!

1313
01:40:50,842 --> 01:40:52,332
My God! There's Selena!

1314
01:40:54,612 --> 01:40:56,045
What's going on?

1315
01:41:06,057 --> 01:41:07,752
You doing good in school?

1316
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:09,554
Can I have your autograph?

1317
01:41:09,627 --> 01:41:12,221
What's going on?
It's Selena!

1318
01:41:12,664 --> 01:41:14,962
Who's Selena?
- She's here for the Grammys.

1319
01:41:15,066 --> 01:41:16,260
The Grammys?

1320
01:41:18,269 --> 01:41:19,600
What do you think?

1321
01:41:20,372 --> 01:41:21,464
Me either.

1322
01:41:21,873 --> 01:41:24,364
Excuse me, miss? Excuse me?

1323
01:41:24,609 --> 01:41:25,974
We don't need the dress.

1324
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:29,439
Thanks.

1325
01:41:33,284 --> 01:41:34,376
Thank you.

1326
01:41:34,452 --> 01:41:36,079
What's your name?
- Heather.

1327
01:41:37,088 --> 01:41:40,751
<i>PRESENTER. The nominees for
Best Mexican-American Album are.</i>

1328
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,687
<i>Vicente Fernandez...</i>

1329
01:41:42,894 --> 01:41:46,159
Whether or not you get
on stage tonight, you're it.

1330
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:49,833
Someone else gets the Grammy

1331
01:41:50,902 --> 01:41:52,494
we'll kick their butts.

1332
01:41:53,705 --> 01:41:56,071
<i>PRESENTER. And
the Grammy goes to.</i>

1333
01:42:01,646 --> 01:42:03,238
<i>Live, Selena!</i>

1334
01:42:32,677 --> 01:42:35,669
<i>First, I'd like
to thank my family.</i>

1335
01:42:35,747 --> 01:42:38,341
<i>My dad, who's my manager.</i>

1336
01:42:38,483 --> 01:42:39,950
<i>Dad, I love you.</i>

1337
01:42:40,218 --> 01:42:41,344
<i>My mom.</i>

1338
01:42:41,453 --> 01:42:43,444
<i>I don't know
what I'd do without you.</i>

1339
01:42:43,521 --> 01:42:48,015
<i>Abie, who's my brother
and produces all my music.</i>

1340
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,620
<i>Suzette,</i>

1341
01:42:49,694 --> 01:42:51,525
<i>thanks for
always being there.</i>

1342
01:42:51,729 --> 01:42:53,356
<i>To my husband, Chris...</i>

1343
01:42:54,365 --> 01:42:55,696
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

1344
01:42:56,835 --> 01:42:59,360
<i>And I'd especially like to thank</i>

1345
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:00,961
<i>the fans.</i>

1346
01:43:01,973 --> 01:43:03,634
<i>Because without you</i>

1347
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:05,175
<i>we'd be nothing.</i>

1348
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:06,501
<i>Thank you.</i>

1349
01:44:17,382 --> 01:44:20,044
<i>REPORTER 1. The fashion show
was a success. How does it feel?</i>

1350
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:22,449
<i>I'm just so
happy. I'm so excited.</i>

1351
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,078
<i>REPORTER 2. When'll
your fashions hit the boutiques?</i>

1352
01:44:24,155 --> 01:44:25,986
Probably about
another month.

1353
01:44:27,225 --> 01:44:28,988
She's been so great.

1354
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:33,458
Everybody chipped in and we'll get her
a present. A ring, from all of us.

1355
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:36,261
Would you like to chip in, too?
- That's great.

1356
01:44:36,367 --> 01:44:39,393
I was just thinking we should
do something like that.

1357
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:42,132
I know a place
where we can get her...

1358
01:44:42,273 --> 01:44:44,833
I know the perfect
ring she would love.

1359
01:44:45,476 --> 01:44:47,944
<i>REPORTER 3.
Any men's fashions?</i>

1360
01:44:48,012 --> 01:44:51,413
We'll stick to women's for now.
Don't know how they'd look in a bustier.

1361
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:54,083
Here, give me the money

1362
01:44:54,185 --> 01:44:56,244
I'll go shopping in a few days.

1363
01:44:56,354 --> 01:44:59,152
It'll be ready by the time
she comes back from Nashville.

1364
01:44:59,257 --> 01:45:01,452
Oh, that's wonderful, Yolanda. Thank you.

1365
01:45:01,559 --> 01:45:05,495
Don't worry about anything.
I'm sure she'll love it.

1366
01:45:07,098 --> 01:45:10,090
<i>Chris, how's married life treating you?
- It's good.</i>

1367
01:45:10,201 --> 01:45:12,032
<i>He better say that!</i>

1368
01:45:13,705 --> 01:45:15,730
<i>REPORTER 4. Any plans
for a Selena 's boutique in Mexico?</i>

1369
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,104
<i>SELENA. We've
been thinking about it.</i>

1370
01:47:23,634 --> 01:47:26,603
That's it. We got
that down. That's a hit.

1371
01:47:26,838 --> 01:47:28,100
I always knew it.

1372
01:47:28,372 --> 01:47:29,964
We got gold, gentlemen.

1373
01:47:32,143 --> 01:47:35,806
<i>They said you're a hit
and that we got gold.</i>

1374
01:47:36,514 --> 01:47:38,106
I told you, girl.

1375
01:47:38,316 --> 01:47:39,647
It's a hit!

1376
01:47:40,818 --> 01:47:42,649
You did it. Oh, man!

1377
01:47:42,787 --> 01:47:46,052
I bet everybody'll wonder
how I learned English so fast.

1378
01:47:46,557 --> 01:47:48,787
I'm starving! Hey, Dad!

1379
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:49,952
Pizza!

1380
01:47:50,461 --> 01:47:52,156
So proud of you.

1381
01:47:52,463 --> 01:47:54,624
Watching you cut that record.

1382
01:47:55,032 --> 01:47:56,192
Boy.

1383
01:47:57,869 --> 01:48:00,360
You broke the Tejano
music scene wide open.

1384
01:48:02,974 --> 01:48:04,999
No woman's ever
been able to make it.

1385
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:08,071
Now you're Number One.

1386
01:48:11,048 --> 01:48:13,039
You walk into Mexico and

1387
01:48:13,417 --> 01:48:16,750
they don't even accept
Mexican-Americans and they love you.

1388
01:48:18,422 --> 01:48:20,481
And now...

1389
01:48:20,892 --> 01:48:22,052
And now?

1390
01:48:22,426 --> 01:48:23,757
Gringos!

1391
01:48:24,996 --> 01:48:26,691
Disney Worid!

1392
01:48:27,265 --> 01:48:29,096
You remember.
- Yes.

1393
01:48:34,105 --> 01:48:37,199
All those barriers people
have been trying to get past,

1394
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:42,445
you went right through them
as if they didn't exist.

1395
01:48:43,681 --> 01:48:45,842
Maybe for you
they don't exist.

1396
01:48:49,053 --> 01:48:50,611
I love you.

1397
01:48:51,289 --> 01:48:53,382
And I'm very proud of you.

1398
01:48:56,327 --> 01:48:57,589
Thanks.

1399
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:00,261
I'm tired.

1400
01:49:04,235 --> 01:49:05,896
How about this blue?

1401
01:49:06,437 --> 01:49:07,734
Blue, out!

1402
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,531
That's pretty.
- Isn't it?

1403
01:49:11,642 --> 01:49:13,542
I think you should go with that one.

1404
01:49:14,946 --> 01:49:17,938
You know, Selena,
I am so proud of you

1405
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:22,109
for the opening of the boutique
and the new record.

1406
01:49:23,054 --> 01:49:26,421
You mean so much to me,
I bought you a little present.

1407
01:49:31,762 --> 01:49:33,457
You shouldn't
have done that.

1408
01:49:36,133 --> 01:49:37,623
Oh, my gosh!

1409
01:49:38,169 --> 01:49:40,433
That is so beautiful.

1410
01:49:41,072 --> 01:49:43,302
A ring with an egg!

1411
01:49:45,142 --> 01:49:46,734
I love it.

1412
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:49,969
You're such a good friend.

1413
01:49:57,088 --> 01:49:58,316
What'd you get?

1414
01:49:58,756 --> 01:50:00,087
Junk food.

1415
01:50:01,993 --> 01:50:03,392
Good.

1416
01:50:05,129 --> 01:50:07,393
How's the grass growing?
Good.

1417
01:50:09,901 --> 01:50:12,335
You know what?
I want a farm.

1418
01:50:12,536 --> 01:50:13,798
A farm?

1419
01:50:14,472 --> 01:50:16,599
Not a big farm. A little farm.

1420
01:50:16,807 --> 01:50:18,206
About 10 acres.

1421
01:50:18,376 --> 01:50:21,573
You want me getting up early
and riding a tractor?

1422
01:50:22,013 --> 01:50:23,981
Yeah, and I want
you to feed the pigs.

1423
01:50:25,716 --> 01:50:27,616
Feed the pigs.
I don't think so.

1424
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:30,219
I want lots of animals, too.

1425
01:50:30,321 --> 01:50:32,482
We'll put a fence in the front

1426
01:50:32,623 --> 01:50:36,616
and have all the cows and chickens
and horses and goats and pigs.

1427
01:50:36,827 --> 01:50:37,987
Wait, wait.

1428
01:50:38,162 --> 01:50:41,689
You have to keep different animals
apart or they'll eat each other.

1429
01:50:42,833 --> 01:50:45,233
Not my animals. My
animals will get along great.

1430
01:50:45,836 --> 01:50:47,565
Whatever you say.

1431
01:50:50,408 --> 01:50:51,898
I've been thinking

1432
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:56,536
about, maybe, having
little animals of our own.

1433
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:01,909
Kids?

1434
01:51:03,587 --> 01:51:04,849
Why not?

1435
01:51:05,856 --> 01:51:09,019
Yeah, but what about
the singing and the touring?

1436
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,351
I mean, you want to give it up?

1437
01:51:11,529 --> 01:51:13,190
No, of course not.

1438
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:16,426
But we could take
the kids along with us.

1439
01:51:16,534 --> 01:51:18,365
It's a family act, right?

1440
01:51:22,873 --> 01:51:25,398
So, you're talking kids,

1441
01:51:25,476 --> 01:51:26,738
a career,

1442
01:51:27,211 --> 01:51:28,940
and a farm with
lots of animals.

1443
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:30,669
Yeah.

1444
01:51:31,782 --> 01:51:33,682
Why not? Anything's possible.

1445
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:36,878
Kids, huh?

1446
01:51:43,627 --> 01:51:44,651
Okay.

1447
01:51:45,496 --> 01:51:46,827
Let's do it.

1448
01:51:47,398 --> 01:51:48,422
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1449
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:54,437
Let's get started!

1450
01:51:57,008 --> 01:51:59,306
Go, go, go!
You forgot the food!

1451
01:52:11,122 --> 01:52:15,320
Hey, Dad. What is so important
you had to drag me over here?

1452
01:52:18,329 --> 01:52:21,526
Selena, we got a problem and
I don't even know where to start.

1453
01:52:21,632 --> 01:52:23,031
It's Yolanda.

1454
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:24,627
What?

1455
01:52:24,702 --> 01:52:28,638
Fans complained that they sent money
to the fan club and received nothing.

1456
01:52:28,806 --> 01:52:30,637
<i>Not a picture. Nada.</i>

1457
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:34,109
Then we found out she had had
a problem with a previous employer.

1458
01:52:34,345 --> 01:52:37,337
What problem? Because
Yolanda wouldn't do that.

1459
01:52:37,615 --> 01:52:38,809
Money problems.

1460
01:52:39,316 --> 01:52:42,444
We didn't find out about it
because they settled out of court.

1461
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:45,887
I went through the records of
the fan club and found these checks.

1462
01:52:46,357 --> 01:52:48,552
They're very suspicious.

1463
01:52:51,695 --> 01:52:53,287
And what's worse,

1464
01:52:53,731 --> 01:52:55,892
is a lot of the
records are missing.

1465
01:53:00,037 --> 01:53:01,231
Selena,

1466
01:53:02,673 --> 01:53:04,072
I'm worried.

1467
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:06,343
She's handling
all the boutiques.

1468
01:53:06,444 --> 01:53:07,570
I know.

1469
01:53:18,889 --> 01:53:21,323
I don't know what to tell you.

1470
01:53:22,526 --> 01:53:26,986
It's true. I did have a problem
with a doctor I worked with.

1471
01:53:27,998 --> 01:53:30,762
But I would never take
anything from Selena.

1472
01:53:30,935 --> 01:53:32,266
Never.

1473
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,861
I love Selena.

1474
01:53:37,274 --> 01:53:39,401
I don't remember these checks.

1475
01:53:44,882 --> 01:53:47,112
What about the
missing records?

1476
01:53:47,618 --> 01:53:49,176
I don't know where they are.

1477
01:53:49,753 --> 01:53:51,220
But I'll find them.

1478
01:53:52,356 --> 01:53:54,085
I will. And I'll show you.

1479
01:53:56,127 --> 01:53:58,220
We need an accounting of all the money.

1480
01:54:22,353 --> 01:54:23,820
Yolanda!

1481
01:54:25,656 --> 01:54:27,248
How could you
do this to me?

1482
01:54:27,358 --> 01:54:29,326
I never took anything from you.

1483
01:54:29,426 --> 01:54:32,259
I trusted you with
everything I have.

1484
01:54:32,363 --> 01:54:33,625
Never.

1485
01:54:34,465 --> 01:54:37,662
How could you do this to my fans?
You know what they mean to me.

1486
01:54:37,801 --> 01:54:40,634
Please. Give me a chance
to prove it to you.

1487
01:54:41,071 --> 01:54:42,333
Please.

1488
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,060
Scratch my head.

1489
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:10,027
Please?

1490
01:56:12,033 --> 01:56:15,730
You know, when we're finished
touring for the crossover album,

1491
01:56:16,338 --> 01:56:18,670
Chris and I were
thinking of having a baby.

1492
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,707
A baby?

1493
01:56:28,583 --> 01:56:30,073
Come here, baby.

1494
01:56:32,587 --> 01:56:34,248
A baby.

1495
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:37,057
I'll be a grandma?

1496
01:56:37,192 --> 01:56:38,682
Not tomorrow.

1497
01:56:43,365 --> 01:56:44,525
Come here.

1498
01:56:52,607 --> 01:56:55,303
I've been thinking about
the crossover tour a lot.

1499
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:01,275
I've even had
dreams about it.

1500
01:57:06,087 --> 01:57:08,817
It's just this whole
different worid for us.

1501
01:57:10,492 --> 01:57:13,290
We've been working for this
ever since we were kids.

1502
01:57:17,632 --> 01:57:19,964
I guess I'm a
little scared.

1503
01:57:25,907 --> 01:57:28,102
Are they going to love me?

1504
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:31,635
<i>Yes, mija.</i>

1505
01:57:32,414 --> 01:57:34,314
They're going to love you.

1506
01:57:35,517 --> 01:57:37,508
Now go to sleep.

1507

1512
01:59:10,712 --> 01:59:12,145
