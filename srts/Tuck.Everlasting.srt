1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,640
(whistling wistful melody)

2
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,130
(bird hoots)

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,580
(clock ticking)

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,210
(water gurgling)

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,980
(hooves clomping)

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,480
(thunder rumbling)

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,520
(kids shouting)

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,360
(horn beeps)

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,110
(engine stops)

10
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,160
NARRATOR:
For some, time passes slowly.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,460
An hour can seem an eternity.

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,300
For others,
there's never enough.

13
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,970
For the Tucks, it didn't exist.

14
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,640
(bird fluttering)

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,670
(tranquil music playing)

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,320
Time is like a wheel...

17
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,810
turning and turning,
never stopping

18
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:49,490
and the woods are the center,
the hub of the wheel.

19
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,030
(melancholy melody playing)

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,640
It began the first week
of summer

21
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,450
a strange and breathless time,
when accident, or fate

22
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,280
bring lives together

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,620
when people are led
to do things

24
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,130
they've never done before.

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,290
(water running)

26
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,130
On this summer's day,
not so very long ago

27
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,800
the wheel set lives in motion
in mysterious ways.

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,170
It set Mae Tuck out
in her wagon

29
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,140
for the village of Treegap

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,340
to meet her two sons as she did
once every ten years.

31
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,340
(horn blares)

32
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,370
(horse whinnies)

33
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,930
(women talking indistinctly)

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,200
(music box playing
wistful melody)

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,170
Ma!

36
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,470
Miles!

37
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,800
Jesse!

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,140
Oh...!

39
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,300
(both laughing)

40
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,310
Oh, I missed you.

41
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,470
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,810
Oh, I couldn't wait to see you.

43
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,810
I missed you, Jesse.

44
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,320
Oh, wait,
I got something for you.

45
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,320
Oh, look at you.

46
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,320
I got something.

47
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,320
Here, look.

48
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,680
The Eiffel Tower.

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,950
Would you look at that.

50
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,290
Got it in Paris, France.

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
Oh, Mom,
you've never seen anything

52
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,120
- So tall in your life.
- Hello...

53
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,150
Oh, I got something else.
I got something else.

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,160
How are you, old friend?

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,490
Your favorite... chocolates.

56
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,160
Oh, I've died
and gone to Heaven.

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,500
Oh, Jesse.

58
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,060
(gasps):
Miles...

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,560
Miles.

60
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,340
Give your mother a hug.

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,270
Ten years.

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,940
(laughs)

63
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,150
You're as cozy as barbed wire.

64
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,580
I have you back.

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,600
WOMAN:
Winifred!

66
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,790
Winifred!

67
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,170
Yes, Mother?

68
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,800
I need a new name.

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,570
One that's not all worn out
from being called so much.

70
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,840
(frog croaking)

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,740
Come inside this instant.

72
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,010
You're getting filthy!

73
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,880
(piano playing)

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,280
(playing classical music)

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,810
Ow! I can scarcely breathe.

76
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,480
(speaking French)

77
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,150
"You must suffer
to be beautiful."

78
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,660
So say the French.

79
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,460
The French are crazy.

80
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,370
(piano music continues
playing)

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,370
(women speaking softly)

82
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,810
NARRATOR:
For Winnie Foster
one thing was true:

83
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,870
the heat of summer was not
nearly as stifling

84
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,900
as the formality of her life.

85
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,470
(piano music continues)

86
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,450
With every passing day

87
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,050
the feeling grew stronger.

88
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,930
She was coming closer
to the end of something

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,120
and moving towards
the beginning of something new.

90
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,290
(playing off-key)

91
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,300
- (groans)
- (music stops)

92
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,960
(sighs)

93
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,310
Change was in the air.

94
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:02,150
It was only a question of when.

95
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,450
(horn honking)

96
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,590
(engine stops)

97
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,360
Wait for me in the car.

98
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,920
I won't be a minute.

99
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,430
In the car, Mrs. Foster.

100
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,270
(kids yelling playfully)

101
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,030
BOY 1:
Throw it home! Throw it home!

102
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,540
BOY 2:
Come on, throw it home!

103
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,600
- Go!
- Run to me!

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,610
Yay!

105
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,230
No, no, no, no, no.

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,340
Too large for tea cakes.

107
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,280
None of these will do.

108
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,840
I prefer petit fours.

109
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,850
BOY (laughing):
What kind of a funny hat
is that?

110
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,440
Well, look'ee here.

111
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,250
If it's not Miss Moneybags
in her fancy car.

112
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,320
What's the matter?

113
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,450
Don't want
to get your feet dirty?

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,860
(kids chuckling)

115
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,460
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Foster.

116
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,630
Not much call
for such treats out here.

117
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,330
Well, I could just make them up
for you, special.

118
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,430
GIRL:
Winnie Foster?

119
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,940
You've got to be kidding!

120
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,140
BOY:
Wow!

121
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,440
GIRL:
Winnie, run!

122
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,380
Run, Winnie, run!

123
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,710
Throw it! Throw it!

124
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,220
BOY 2:
Throw it home! Come on!

125
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,950
Slide, Winnie, slide!

126
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,620
Winifred!

127
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
(fiddle music playing)

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,400
(geese clucking)

129
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,440
(clapping and laughing)

130
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,140
JESSE:
Oh, and they had
their arms crossed

131
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,120
and you see, the lines
were perfectly square.

132
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,210
Come here, come here.

133
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,450
I want to teach you. Come on.

134
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,780
Oh, all the way from France.

135
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,980
How about that?

136
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,390
Oh, look. Look-Look at this one.

137
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,790
I want to see, Pop. Let me see.

138
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,800
Look it.

139
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,320
Oh! Aah, he shot me!

140
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,190
Oh, I'm dead!

141
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,390
MAE:
Oh, oh, my!

142
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,800
- (Jesse groaning)
- Oh, my!

143
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,810
Oh, you'll have to see this one.

144
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,470
Miles, look at this!

145
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,470
(laughing)

146
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,070
Oh... let's see.

147
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,670
Okay, come here,
I want to show you.

148
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,910
I want to show you.

149
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,110
All right.

150
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,210
Good to have you home, son.

151
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm glad to see you.

152
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,590
And the family together.

153
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,290
But don't get used to it.

154
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,600
War's coming, I hear.

155
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,260
I'm joining up.

156
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,760
I'm going to fight the Huns.

157
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,140
Get as far away
from this place as I can.

158
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,950
Oh, you think
that'll solve things, do you?

159
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,830
You haven't had enough killing
for two lifetimes?

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,230
Somebody's on to us.

161
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,760
I know it.

162
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,370
There's a man who's been
following us

163
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,610
and we've lost him
several times, but...

164
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,850
he keeps coming back.

165
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,660
I think he knows something.

166
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,100
This man...

167
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,130
(laughing)

168
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,440
Jesse...

169
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,970
- (laughter)
- Whoo!

170
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,040
We're being tracked.

171
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,450
Oh, Miles, we lost him.

172
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,820
Don't go spoiling everything.

173
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,120
Yeah, we lost him, Jess...

174
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,790
but he keeps coming back.

175
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,460
It was only a matter of time
before someone found us.

176
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,900
The world is closing in.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,130
Entire forest is almost gone.

178
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,870
All except this little wood.

179
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,150
I saw tire marks down
on the lower wash...

180
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,210
a few weeks ago.

181
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,820
There'll be more.

182
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,230
I don't want anyone going
to town.

183
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,660
Not for anything,
and that's that.

184
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,100
Tuck.

185
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,030
You see any strangers
in the woods getting too close

186
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,200
you know what to do.

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,040
No exceptions.

188
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,040
Our time here is almost done.

189
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,750
I can feel it.

190
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,580
MAN:
You'll never catch one that way.

191
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,480
Do you know
about catching fireflies?

192
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,980
Afraid not, never tried.

193
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,480
I prefer... bigger game.

194
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,140
Though I suspect the strategy

195
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,590
is much the same.

196
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,990
Strategy?

197
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,150
One must never announce
one's presence to the prey.

198
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,320
One must become part
of the scenery...

199
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,660
invisible...

200
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,260
almost disappear.

201
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,270
And be patient

202
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,070
until the exact, right moment

203
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,130
arrives... (grunts)

204
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,400
(gasps)

205
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,000
Take a prisoner.

206
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,340
For you?

207
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,680
No, thank you.

208
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,850
You're quite right.

209
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,450
A girl of your age
should find...

210
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,990
trapping suitors
more interesting

211
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,420
than trapping insects, anyway.

212
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,950
Far easier, I might add.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,230
Have you lived here long?

214
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,460
Forever. Why?

215
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,660
I'm... looking
for some old friends

216
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,140
who live hereabouts.

217
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,640
Thought you might
help me find them.

218
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,040
My father
practically built Treegap.

219
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,310
He knows everyone.

220
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,970
Perhaps he can help you.

221
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,140
Perhaps.

222
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,810
I quite like talking to you.

223
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,320
MRS. FOSTER:
Winifred?

224
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,480
Winifred, who are you talking to
out there?

225
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,150
I don't know.

226
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,830
He hasn't told me his name.

227
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,460
Good evening, madam.

228
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,470
Please forgive my intrusion.

229
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,100
This young lady tells me
you've lived here forever.

230
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,400
I thought you might know
of a certain family

231
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,700
goes by the name of...

232
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,070
I hardly know everyone,
nor do I want to.

233
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,940
And I don't stand outside
discussing such a thing

234
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,570
with... strangers.

235
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,140
Then I beg your pardon.

236
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,710
Good evening, young lady.

237
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,740
Madam.

238
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,820
(whistling wistful melody)

239
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,850
This is why I worry
about you, Winifred.

240
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,130
You don't have the sense
not to talk to a man like that.

241
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,600
(whistling continues)

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,200
MRS. FOSTER:
A proper education gains one
entré into society.

243
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,900
MR. FOSTER:
Your mother and I have given
this a great deal of thought.

244
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,740
Middlehouse Academy for Girls

245
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,580
in Pensford,
has an excellent reputation.

246
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,610
Middlehouse?

247
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,590
But that's a terrible place,
everyone says so.

248
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,950
It's like a jail.

249
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,960
Nonsense.

250
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,830
Girls emerge from there
as refined young ladies

251
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,130
well-versed in etiquette
and manners,

252
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,290
both of which
you are sorely lacking.

253
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,800
But I don't want to be
one of those girls.

254
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,300
Which is precisely why
you must go.

255
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,430
I cannot let
your unbridled nature

256
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,570
ruin your chances
for a respectable future.

257
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,200
Winifred... I'm sorry...

258
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,310
but we have to do
what's best for you.

259
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,120
I won't do it.

260
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,750
I'm not like those girls.

261
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,760
I won't go!

262
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,850
Winifred!

263
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,990
I won't go!

264
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,690
(melancholy music playing)

265
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,470
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was to be sent
500 miles away to be educated.

266
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,950
But what her parents didn't
understand

267
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,580
was she only wanted to step
just outside her fence...

268
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,310
so she did.

269
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,520
(birds chirping)

270
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,760
What in these quiet woods
should be so forbidden?

271
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,830
Winnie had always sensed
a mystery

272
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,100
waiting for her there.

273
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:26,840
It was a place so entirely
different from what she knew

274
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,250
so far away from her tight,
pruned world.

275
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,660
(birds screeching)

276
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,560
(gasps)

277
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
(foreboding music playing)

278
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,660
(water gurgling)

279
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,930
(music playing gently)

280
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,580
Ah!

281
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,770
Ah...

282
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,320
(exhales)

283
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,140
How long have you been
standing there?

284
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,480
Not long at all.

285
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,680
I was only walking past,
and I...

286
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,650
Well, you shouldn't...

287
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,180
be in these parts of the woods.

288
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,820
It's best you turn around
and go home.

289
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,960
Well, go on, now, get!

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Excuse me,
but I own these woods, and...

291
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,100
I'll go on and get
when I want to.

292
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,370
You own these woods?

293
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,440
Yes, I do.

294
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,310
What's your name?

295
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,080
Winifred.

296
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,790
Winnie... Foster.

297
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,090
A Foster?

298
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,650
Well, I'll be.

299
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,670
Is that a fact?

300
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,230
Well... Winnie Foster,
like I was saying

301
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,470
you need to turn around
and go home.

302
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,600
It just so happens
that I was on my way home

303
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,200
before you made
your rude suggestion

304
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,150
and I would be happy
to continue on my way

305
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,510
if I only knew which way to go.

306
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,040
In other words, you're lost?

307
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,380
I'll point you home.

308
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,690
I'd be much obliged.

309
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,700
But I want a drink first.

310
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,200
Wait... no!

311
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,220
No!

312
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,390
What?

313
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,330
You don't want that water.

314
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,560
Uh, it's poisoned.

315
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,260
I saw you drink some.

316
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,330
Well, now I'm feeling sick.

317
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,270
You don't look ill.

318
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,430
I'm dry as dust.

319
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,600
I said, leave it alone!

320
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,080
Let go of me! My father
will have you arrested!

321
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,580
You're not going to go
and tell him, now, are you?

322
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,080
Hey! Come back!

323
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,780
Don't run away!

324
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,150
(panting)

325
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,090
Come back!

326
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,420
(screams)

327
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,230
Where you going so fast, Miss?

328
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,390
Miles, wait!

329
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,700
- No! No!
- You know what Tuck said, Jesse.

330
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,930
- No exceptions.
- Help!

331
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,630
You can't do this.

332
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,910
Stop! Let go!

333
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,910
We can't.

334
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,840
(Winifred grunting)

335
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,870
(rapid drumbeat music playing)

336
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,940
(horse snorting)

337
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,020
(panting)

338
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,250
Miles!

339
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,800
(grunting)

340
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,010
(grunting)

341
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,660
(panting)

342
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,870
Miss Foster!

343
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,280
Miss Foster!

344
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,880
Miss Foster!

345
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,480
Where are you?!

346
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,130
(horse galloping)

347
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,370
Ho.

348
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,810
(horse snorts)

349
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,330
We're stopping here.

350
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,050
- Not a word out of you, hear me?
- (yells)

351
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,070
Miles!

352
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,710
- What are you doing?
- No!

353
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,220
Let the poor girl go.

354
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,780
There's no reason
to be frightened, young lady.

355
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,980
(crying)

356
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,150
I caught her at the spring
with Jesse.

357
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,250
She's a Foster.

358
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,960
Oh, Lord.

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,430
It's finally happened.

360
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,660
I want to go home, please.

361
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,860
I want to go home.

362
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,430
There, there, child.
Please don't cry.

363
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,560
We're not bad people.

364
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,330
We'll take you home
just as soon as we can.

365
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,030
I promise.

366
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,670
Miles, go find your father.

367
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,080
He's across the lake.

368
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,170
He'll know what to do with her.

369
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,550
Tell Jesse I'm going to fix
that mouth of his.

370
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,020
(sighs)

371
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,090
(music box plays
wistful melody)

372
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,800
I've heard that.

373
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,040
Have you?

374
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,380
It's, it's my little music box.

375
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,440
I found it
in the forest one day.

376
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,810
Just waiting for me, I expect.

377
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,410
I've had it a long, long time.

378
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,980
(sighs)

379
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,220
Oh!

380
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,430
I put my baby boys
to bed with it every night.

381
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,870
Gave 'em such sweet dreams.

382
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,300
(music box plays)

383
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,570
(crickets chirping)

384
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,570
(frogs croaking)

385
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm sure my boys
didn't mean you any harm.

386
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,350
Then why did they bring me here
this way?

387
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,580
Why am I here?

388
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,640
(sighs)

389
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,710
You have every right
to be upset.

390
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,420
And I know your family
must be...

391
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,650
worried sick about you.

392
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,490
(door opens)

393
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,960
Where's the child?

394
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,330
MAE:
She's no child... Angus.

395
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,090
(whispering):
Does she know?

396
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,360
Why do you think
I brought her...?

397
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,370
(indistinct whispering)

398
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,460
Yeah, but now she knows
about us, thanks to you.

399
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,470
Shh! Shh!

400
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,900
She's a Foster,
she only knows...

401
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,700
Know what?

402
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,450
Miss Foster,
this is my husband, Angus Tuck.

403
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,150
Angus, meet Miss Foster.

404
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,230
Hello, Miss Foster.

405
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,560
She's the most important event

406
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,900
that's taken place in this house
in 80 years.

407
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,070
You hungry?

408
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,050
MAE:
Oh, well, let's, let's all eat.

409
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah.

410
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,920
Jesse, pass your mother
a plate, please?

411
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,350
JESSE:
Mmm, where's the fish?

412
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,380
Oh, they weren't biting
for some reason.

413
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,150
(chuckles):
'Cause Pa can't fish?

414
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,160
Don't matter. There's plenty.

415
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,920
I catch fish.

416
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,190
If there's no fish,
there's no fish

417
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,430
if you keep scaring
the fish away.

418
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,560
(chuckling)

419
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,130
Mmm, this looks good.

420
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,640
MAE:
Oh! Isn't this nice?

421
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,270
Everybody sitting down together
and having Miss Foster here.

422
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,400
It's just like having a party.

423
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,710
My father will come looking
for me.

424
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,740
Your father... will cut down
the entire forest

425
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,980
the way things are changing
around here.

426
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,650
Make himself a very rich man.

427
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,990
Oh, now, let's not ruin
a perfectly good meal

428
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,430
with a lot of talk.

429
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,760
My father has plenty of money.

430
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,630
He'll pay.

431
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,930
Anything you want.

432
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,270
We don't want your father's
money, Miss Foster.

433
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,000
Then let me go home.

434
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,370
We will.

435
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,740
We'll let you go home...
just like I promised.

436
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,970
Directly.

437
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,740
We'll need to be able
to trust her first

438
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,650
before we're sending her
back to her folks.

439
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,920
Trust her? We can't trust her.

440
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,550
Or any normal people.

441
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,850
She'll turn on us in a second.

442
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,020
No, she won't.

443
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,660
You're a fool.

444
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,860
You don't even realize
what you've done here.

445
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,810
(slams door)

446
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,350
(clock ticking)

447
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,520
(clock ticking)

448
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,980
Him.

449
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,000
It's him.

450
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,010
Robert!

451
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,710
I expect you to find her, Henry.

452
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,080
That's your job.

453
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,450
I've already wired her
description down the main line.

454
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,460
They'll keep a lookout

455
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,460
and we'll get up a search party
come morning.

456
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,820
My wife is certain that this man
wearing a yellow suit

457
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,020
has something to do
with Winifred's disappearance.

458
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,190
And Miss Foster says so
based on...?

459
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,800
Her instincts.

460
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,060
Hmm.

461
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,540
Well, maybe you better step
in here, Mr. Foster.

462
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,040
Am I whom you're looking for?

463
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,140
I do believe I fit
the description.

464
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,150
My wife said she saw you
talking to my daughter.

465
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,320
Yes, I did.

466
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,420
She's a charming girl,
full of fire.

467
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,190
Perhaps too much.

468
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,820
She's gone, is she?

469
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,630
Looks like she... ran away.

470
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,830
Did she now?

471
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,300
Somehow I'm not surprised.

472
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,970
My daughter did not... run away.

473
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,740
And I'm not interested
in what surprises you, sir.

474
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,180
I want to know
if you know anything

475
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,180
of her whereabouts.

476
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,180
No, Mr. Foster.

477
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,010
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I do not.

478
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,010
I am quite coincidentally here
in search of someone myself.

479
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,180
I'm seeking a family

480
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,850
that used to live
in these environs.

481
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,250
I thought the constable could

482
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,320
help me locate them,
but ironically, Mr. Foster

483
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,090
your daughter thought
you could help.

484
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,350
Name of Tuck.

485
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,030
Long lost relatives.

486
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,500
I-I can't help you.

487
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,930
Nor I you.

488
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,170
At least not now.

489
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,740
However, I'd be happy

490
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,770
to search your woods
for you, Mr. Foster.

491
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm rather talented
at finding people.

492
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,280
I just might meet with success.

493
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,580
Good evening, Constable.

494
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,030
Find out what happened
to her, Henry.

495
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,860
Please.

496
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,200
She's our only child.

497
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,340
Angus made that cradle.

498
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,270
Brought it all the way
from Scotland.

499
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,840
Oh, it's rocked a few Tucks.

500
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,180
There you go.

501
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,580
The breeze off the lake
will keep you cool all night.

502
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,050
The boys sleep up in the loft
when they're home

503
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,610
so you'll have your privacy.

504
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,690
Oh, that corset looks painful.

505
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,560
May I help you off with it?

506
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,640
Oh, honestly, I can't understand

507
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,870
why women torture themselves
this way.

508
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,610
It's no way to live.

509
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,640
Do you have a daughter?

510
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,740
A granddaughter.

511
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,380
And a grandson.

512
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,080
Anna and Beau.

513
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,960
Oh, Miles loved them so.

514
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,420
What happened?

515
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,900
They died.

516
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,330
Their mother, too.

517
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,960
I'm afraid the good parts
of Miles died along with them.

518
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,740
You'll have to forgive
what's left of him.

519
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,870
I'm sorry.

520
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,400
Well, it's... it's the way
things are, Miss Foster.

521
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,010
Can I call you Winnie?

522
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,780
MAE:
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

523
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,450
WINIFRED:
No, it's only me.

524
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,460
My mother...

525
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,020
(soft music playing)

526
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,860
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

527
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,570
MAE:
There.

528
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,770
WINNIE:
So where do they go?

529
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,830
Oh, they go different places,
do different things.

530
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,070
Miles can do carpentry
and he's good with his hands.

531
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,840
Jesse, now, he seems
to have settled himself.

532
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,370
Of course, then, he's...

533
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,410
he's young yet.

534
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,060
Well...

535
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,220
I hope you will be
comfortable here.

536
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,570
It's a good feeling
having another woman here.

537
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,970
Try and get some sleep now.

538
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,390
(church bells toll
in distance)

539
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,460
(scoffs)

540
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,470
MAN:
Hello?

541
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,830
(church bells tolling)

542
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,670
Have you lost your way, friend?

543
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,110
Not hardly, Reverend.

544
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,480
I'm looking
for a family name... Tuck.

545
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,210
Are you familiar with it?

546
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,480
Tuck. Tuck?

547
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm afraid I can't help you.

548
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,880
There are no Tucks
in this cemetery that I know of.

549
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,980
No, I wouldn't think so.

550
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,990
Ha!

551
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,650
Or in any other.

552
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,990
Tell me, Reverend

553
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,830
you who have attended
so many deathbeds...

554
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,990
what is it people most desire

555
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,200
as they face the end
of their lives?

556
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,670
More time?

557
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,830
Well, I suppose.

558
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,740
Exactly.

559
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,770
They'd give almost anything,
I imagine, for one more year.

560
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,720
Imagine what they'd give
for all eternity.

561
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,720
Sir, I don't quite understand
what...

562
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,740
You will.

563
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,430
Reverend, are you prepared
to die right now, this instant?

564
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,820
If it's God's will.

565
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,190
What if it is my will?

566
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,790
What if you could be eternal?

567
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,830
Right now, this instant?

568
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,030
Without having to face
the uncertainty of death?

569
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,230
Hmm?

570
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,110
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

571
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,370
No muss, no fuss.

572
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,570
Invincible to disease.

573
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,750
Never having to suffer
the stench and rot of old age.

574
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,020
Forever young.

575
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:52,080
You speak blasphemy, sir.

576
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,650
Fluently.

577
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,290
(laughs)

578
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,930
Good night, Reverend.

579
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,810
(whistling wistful melody)

580
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,670
Hey, Winnie Foster, you asleep?

581
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,270
Not anymore.

582
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,780
Good.

583
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,580
Hey.

584
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,580
Listen.

585
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,680
How would you like
to see the Eiffel Tower?

586
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,690
What?

587
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,920
Someday.

588
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,930
No, now.

589
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,520
While the day is still ours.

590
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,720
(birds singing)

591
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,830
Get those dogs over there.

592
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,000
Yes, sir.

593
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,440
Come on, boys, let's go.

594
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,100
Henry, this is
Winifred's nightgown.

595
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,440
Give it to the dog handlers.

596
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,530
Start in the north end.

597
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,340
Let's split up
when we get to the lake.

598
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,570
We'll find her.

599
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,810
I know we will.

600
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,280
Winifred!

601
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,880
Miss Foster!

602
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,080
Winnie!

603
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,110
Winifred Foster!

604
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,450
Miss Foster!

605
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,620
Winifred!

606
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,090
Over here!

607
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,160
I found something!

608
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,110
(both panting)

609
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,940
There it is.

610
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,580
This is the Eiffel Tower?

611
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,920
The one in Paris,
it's pretty tall.

612
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,620
Mine's two feet higher.

613
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,340
Here.

614
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,960
Come on.

615
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,070
Have you really seen
the real one in Paris?

616
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,340
Yes, I have.

617
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,440
And climbed 1,652 stairs
to the top.

618
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,100
Much easier than this.

619
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,270
Yes.

620
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,440
You doing all right?

621
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,610
I think so.

622
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,780
You're doing great.

623
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,720
Here.

624
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,890
If I went to the Eiffel Tower

625
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,450
I would take
one of those elevators.

626
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,650
Not with me.

627
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,060
You'd take off your shoes

628
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,260
and walk up
every single solitary step.

629
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,590
How old are you?

630
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,470
Do you really want to know?

631
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,270
Yes.

632
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,740
104.

633
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,870
I'm serious.

634
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,680
So am I.

635
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,510
Let's just call it 17.

636
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,260
There's my Paris.

637
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,760
The view from the Eiffel Tower
can't be better than this.

638
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,470
I've seen a lot of views,
and this is one of the best.

639
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:41,580
(piano playing
classical music)

640
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,160
(clock ticking)

641
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:03,940
(men shouting)

642
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,950
Come on.

643
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,450
(dogs barking)

644
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,130
(music ends)

645
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,510
(shouting playfully)

646
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:15,710
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was beginning
to lose track of time.

647
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,520
Had she been there a day,
a week, a month?

648
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,120
It seemed to Winnie
that the Tucks lived in a way

649
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,890
the rest of the world
had forgotten.

650
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,300
They were never in a hurry
and did things the slow way.

651
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,450
For the first time

652
00:38:54,490 --> 00:39:01,090
Winnie felt free to explore,
to ask questions, to play.

653
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,810
# #

654
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,420
Me?

655
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,260
I'm going to see the world.

656
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,590
Every speck of it.

657
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,160
Heck, I may even find some
new continents or something.

658
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,430
I mean, I've been
to a lot of places

659
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,500
but the world is huge!

660
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,440
Jesse Tuck,
what-what are you doing?

661
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,980
What does it look like?

662
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,360
Woo-hoo!

663
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,990
Woo! Ah, whoo.

664
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,170
(gasping)

665
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,900
Come on!

666
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,140
I can't!

667
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,480
Why?

668
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,810
You're not afraid of a little
cold water, are you?

669
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,150
No.

670
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,480
Are you afraid of me?

671
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,280
No.

672
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,220
Well, what then?

673
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,150
I can't swim.

674
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,160
You're joshing me.

675
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,890
I wish I were.

676
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,730
So, you're afraid you'll drown,
right?

677
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:51,860
Swallow too much water,
sink to the bottom and die.

678
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,000
Thank you for putting it
so vividly.

679
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,510
And, yes,
considering I'd sink like a rock

680
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,170
drowning is a fair concern.

681
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,510
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to enjoy this

682
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,180
all by myself.

683
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,950
Hmm...

684
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,420
Hmm!

685
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,200
(yells)

686
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,300
Ah, Jesse!

687
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,310
Hey, hey, it's okay.

688
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,970
Come here, come here, come here.

689
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,310
I've got you, I've got you.

690
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,480
I've got you, relax.

691
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,980
Relax against me.

692
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,140
You all right?

693
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,310
I think so.

694
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,150
Whoo!

695
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,320
You did it!

696
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,490
I did it!

697
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,320
Ah, it feels wonderful.

698
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,990
I'm weightless.

699
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,330
That's 'cause we're
carrying you, see?

700
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,840
The water and me.

701
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,500
We're both carrying you.

702
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,840
You like the feeling?

703
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,210
I love it.

704
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,280
Jesse, don't let go!

705
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,610
It's okay, it's okay.

706
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,280
There's no chance of that,
Winnie Foster.

707
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,810
I'm never going to let you go.

708
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,600
# #

709
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,290
# #

710
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,440
(horse nickers)

711
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,310
(car honking)

712
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,820
(honky-tonk music playing)

713
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,770
You know, I don't like
being laughed at by a cheat.

714
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,600
Now "cheat" is a nasty word,
sir.

715
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,440
I much prefer "card sharp."

716
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,920
(chuckles)

717
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,760
You are looking for trouble,
aren't you, mister?

718
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,430
Yes, sir, I sure am.

719
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,700
Going outside!

720
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,710
Come on!

721
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,100
Perhaps next time...

722
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,440
(glass breaking)

723
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,460
Come on!

724
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,870
He can't hurt me!

725
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,440
Whoo!

726
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,820
(laughing)

727
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,790
Thank you.

728
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,160
Thank you very much.

729
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,660
Excuse me, citizen.

730
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,010
(bird hooting)

731
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,790
(bird screeching)

732
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,320
You hear that?

733
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,760
Tuck says
it's the most melancholy sound

734
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,420
in all of nature.

735
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,430
Listen.

736
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,090
Just listen.

737
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,800
(cacophony of bird sounds)

738
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,140
They're playing for you.

739
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,300
(drumbeats)

740
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:51,000
(rhythmic tapping)

741
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:58,570
# #

742
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,740
Whoo! Yeah!

743
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,740
# #

744
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,090
# #

745
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,380
# #

746
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,410
I wish this moment
could last forever.

747
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,080
Forever?

748
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,420
You want to spend forever
with me, Winnie?

749
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,790
I do.

750
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,260
You know, we could see
the world together.

751
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,260
We could do
everything together.

752
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,770
Have a million moments
like this one that...

753
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,650
never, never stop.

754
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,290
There's a part about us
you don't know...

755
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,620
the part I've sworn
not to tell you.

756
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,290
The secret?

757
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:59,700
The reason you don't want anyone
to find out about you?

758
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:00,860
I knew it.

759
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,860
You're... you're bank robbers
or grifters.

760
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,400
You are the first human
I've ever met

761
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,300
I wanted to know the truth.

762
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,910
Jesse Tuck, you're the first
human I've ever met

763
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,580
that I've ever wanted to...

764
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,450
to...

765
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,520
...to do that.

766
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,860
Winnie, listen.

767
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,140
Remember the giant oak tree

768
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,970
at the center of the wood
where we met?

769
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:50,950
The little spring bubbling up
you saw me drink from?

770
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,420
You remember when I told you
I was 104 years old?

771
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,380
Well...

772
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,860
it's the honest truth.

773
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,060
I'm going to live forever.

774
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,870
I'm never going to change.

775
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,740
The same with Miles
and Tuck and Mae.

776
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,570
Something happened to us.

777
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,550
As far as I know, I'm...
I'm going to be 17

778
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,570
until the end of the world.

779
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,680
It's the spring, Winnie.

780
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,420
The water,
something's wrong with it.

781
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,850
It stops you
right where you are.

782
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,880
If you had a drink of it today,
you'd stay just like you are.

783
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,050
(twigs snapping)

784
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,260
Don't you wish he'd told you...

785
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,300
before you kissed him?

786
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,360
Did he tell you

787
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:51,340
immortality isn't all the
preachers crack it up to be?

788
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,710
Hey, leave her alone, Miles.

789
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:57,110
Oh, now... you want her
to hear it, Jesse boy.

790
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:01,090
She's the first person
you want to tell the truth to.

791
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,450
You just don't want me
to have what you lost.

792
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,220
WINNIE:
Stop this...

793
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,790
...both of you

794
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,630
and tell me the truth.

795
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,930
I want to know.

796
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,870
We all had a drink...

797
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,180
...except for the cat...
that's important.

798
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,210
(gentle music playing)

799
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,310
The water tasted like...

800
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,980
Heaven.

801
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,120
Floated over your tongue
like a cloud.

802
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,430
Tuck carved a "T" in the trunk,
to mark where we'd been.

803
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,400
We moved on west, looking
for a place to settle down.

804
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,640
Put up a house for Mae and Tuck

805
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,900
and a little shed
for Jesse and me.

806
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:06,450
That was the first time we
figured there was something...

807
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,780
(chuckles)

808
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,790
peculiar.

809
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,150
(muffled yell)

810
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,890
Jesse fell 30 feet,
landed right on his neck.

811
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,400
(muffled yell)

812
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,160
He was up on his feet again

813
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,430
before Mae could work up
a good cry.

814
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,700
Didn't hurt him a bit.
No broken bones... nothing.

815
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,860
That's not all.

816
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:32,670
Not by a long shot.

817
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,440
Things began to happen.

818
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,140
# #

819
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,670
Some brushpoppers mistook

820
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,420
- Mae's horse for a deer.
- (gunshots)

821
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,290
Thing is,
the bullets didn't kill him.

822
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:49,790
Barely even left a mark.

823
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,390
Then Tuck got bitten

824
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:54,160
by a rattlesnake,
and you know what?

825
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,000
He didn't die...

826
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,900
(laughs)

827
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,930
...but the cat did

828
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,130
of old age.

829
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,070
# #

830
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,880
And Miles got married.

831
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,220
Daddy!

832
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,760
(laughing)

833
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,430
(laughing)

834
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,510
(whispering):
Beau.

835
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,450
Little Anna.

836
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,360
Tuck figured it early on.

837
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:57,330
It's the spring.

838
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,700
We all drank from it,
even the horse.

839
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:10,440
Had to be... the source
of our changelessness.

840
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,250
I begged her to come back...
for me

841
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,780
and find the spring
and drink from it.

842
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,450
The children, too.

843
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,080
It was our only hope
to be together.

844
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,400
(chain creaking)

845
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,830
(creaking)

846
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,360
She made up her mind

847
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,840
I'd sold my soul
to the Devil...

848
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,600
...and she left me.

849
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,610
She took my babies with her.

850
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,640
(creaking)

851
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,060
Everyone...
pulled away after that.

852
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:06,330
There was talk of witchcraft...
black magic.

853
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,600
(whinnying)

854
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,040
(whinnying)

855
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,380
# #

856
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,690
I went looking for wars
to fight...

857
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:37,250
and I saw brave men die
at Vera Cruz...

858
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,820
and then Gettysburg...

859
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,200
thousands,
in the blink of an eye...

860
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,510
(voice breaking):
...but not me.

861
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,530
I couldn't die...

862
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,070
...like little Anna.

863
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:05,080
The influenza took her
before she's 15.

864
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,020
And Beau.

865
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,250
He'd be almost 80 now

866
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,280
if he were still alive.

867
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,360
And my sweet...

868
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,380
...my sweet young bride.

869
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,610
She died in an insane asylum...

870
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,920
...old and alone.

871
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,620
(crying):
But I'm still here.

872
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:48,930
I'm still here.

873
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,200
(crying)

874
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,230
# #

875
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,270
# #

876
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,940
(birds chirping)

877
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,960
# #

878
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,970
# #

879
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,880
Winnie Foster, you're the only
other person in the world

880
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,920
who knows about us.

881
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,730
We'll have to have a talk.

882
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,230
Pa.

883
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,930
Come on.

884
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,800
(birds chirping)

885
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,840
# #

886
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,820
# #

887
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,520
(whispering):
Look around you.

888
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,640
It's teeming life.

889
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,970
It's flowers and trees
and frogs.

890
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:38,570
It's... it's all part
of the wheel.

891
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:41,580
It's always changing;
it's always growing

892
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,080
like you, Winnie.

893
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:47,350
Your life is never the same.

894
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:51,690
You were once a child.

895
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,390
Now, you are
about to become a woman.

896
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,090
One day, you'll grow up

897
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,390
and you'll do
something important.

898
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,630
You'll have children,
maybe, and then one day

899
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,970
you'll go out...

900
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,970
just like the flame of a candle.

901
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,840
You'll make way for new life.

902
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,170
That's a certainty.

903
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,080
That's the natural way
of things.

904
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,010
And then, there's us.

905
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:20,010
What we Tucks have,
you can't call it living.

906
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,020
We just... are.

907
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:27,050
We're like rocks,
stuck at the side of a stream.

908
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,950
Listen to me.

909
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,730
Winnie, you know
a dangerous secret.

910
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,260
If people find out
about the spring

911
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,820
they'll trample
all over each other

912
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:36,840
to get to that water.

913
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:39,740
There's one thing I've learned
about people.

914
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,670
Many will do anything,
anything not to die

915
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:46,340
and they'll do anything
to keep from living their life.

916
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,150
Do you want
to stay stuck as you are

917
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,170
right now, forever?

918
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,060
I've just got
to make you understand.

919
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,150
I don't want to die.
Is that wrong?

920
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,490
No.

921
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:10,160
No human does...

922
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,500
but i-it's part of the wheel...

923
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,300
the same as being born.

924
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:20,570
You can't have living
without dying.

925
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,780
Don't be afraid of death,
Winnie.

926
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,810
Be afraid of the unlived life.

927
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,790
# #

928
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:44,420
# #

929
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:56,110
# #

930
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:57,640
(knocking at door)

931
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,670
(hinges creaking)

932
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,980
Your tea, sir.

933
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,800
She's with them now.

934
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,800
I came directly here,

935
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,130
knowing how tormented
you must be.

936
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:23,140
We-we just want her back safely.

937
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,570
Course you do.

938
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,910
Dreadful business, kidnapping.

939
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,910
Fortunate I was witness.

940
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,920
I'm perhaps the only person...

941
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,940
who knows where to find her.

942
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,120
Just what is your game, sir?

943
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,820
What is my game?

944
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,760
You detect in me a playful mood?

945
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,500
"Playful" is not
the word I had in mind.

946
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,260
What I have in mind
is a simple, clear-cut trade.

947
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,870
You see,
I very much like your woods

948
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,940
not for their timber, mind you

949
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,810
but for their natural assets.

950
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,880
Wh-What is it you want?

951
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,890
You want your daughter.

952
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,760
I want your woods.

953
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:18,730
You're involved in this,
aren't you?

954
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,290
If you have touched
my daughter...!

955
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,000
I have my faults, Mr. Foster.

956
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:26,160
Kidnapping is not amongst them.

957
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,040
These are rough people,
the ones who took her.

958
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:33,010
No telling what they might do.

959
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,980
(exhales)

960
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,140
Unless we do what you say.

961
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,180
Give the man whatever he wants.

962
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:52,030
(hinges creaking)

963
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,600
Done and done.

964
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,800
Nice to have things legal
and tidy, don't you agree?

965
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,900
You're an intelligent,
reasonable man, Mr. Foster.

966
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,460
I'm seldom wrong
as a judge of character.

967
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,670
Have your friendly constable
on hand

968
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,680
to make
the appropriate arrests.

969
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,280
Your terrible ordeal is
as good as over.

970
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,010
I'll get there before you.

971
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:17,820
We have to move quickly.

972
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,910
They were packing to leave.

973
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,020
ROBERT:
What kind of horrible people
must these kidnappers be?

974
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,690
HENRY:
There is evil in the world,
Mr. Foster.

975
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:31,460
There aren't fences high enough
to keep it out.

976
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:34,060
ROBERT:
Bring your men
directly to my house.

977
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,440
I'm going with you.

978
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:37,440
(dogs barking)

979
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,470
# #

980
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,680
# #

981
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:58,960
(birds calling)

982
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,590
It isn't fair, Tuck.

983
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,100
No, it isn't...

984
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,800
but when has life
ever been fair?

985
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,800
How am I going to take you home

986
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,810
when I can't make my feet move
from this spot?

987
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,150
If I could die tomorrow,
I'd do it...

988
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,950
just to spend one more night
with you.

989
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,750
Forgive me for interrupting
such a tender moment.

990
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,030
Hello, Winifred.

991
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:39,970
Everyone's been so worried
about you.

992
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,800
I'm relieved
to find you so well.

993
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,530
You know this man?

994
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,070
I met him once.

995
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,980
Hello, Mr. Tuck.

996
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,690
You have no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

997
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,290
You're the man
who's been following my boys.

998
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,730
Been expecting you.

999
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,740
Yes, and here I am.

1000
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:19,670
Tell me, is it a relief...
to finally be discovered?

1001
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:24,340
Over a century of hiding out
must have taken its toll on you.

1002
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,040
Who are you?

1003
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,420
And how do you know so much
about us?

1004
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,720
I first heard about your family
from my grandmother.

1005
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,750
She knew a woman
in a mental facility

1006
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,490
who used to...
rant and ramble about a family

1007
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,300
who never grew old
and never died.

1008
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,600
This woman,
she used to call out a name.

1009
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,260
What was it, now?

1010
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,600
Anna.

1011
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,230
Crazy old woman.

1012
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,680
Kept on talking
about a music box.

1013
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:59,310
It seems the melody had a
calming effect on her children.

1014
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,410
I'm sure you know it, Mrs. Tuck?

1015
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:05,290
(whistling wistful melody)

1016
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,290
(music box playing)

1017
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,960
You have no right...

1018
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,560
to come to our home...
and bring us such pain.

1019
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,090
There, good mother.

1020
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,170
I mean no harm.

1021
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,940
Tell us, sir.

1022
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,280
What is it you want?

1023
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,450
Well, you see, the Fosters
have given me these woods

1024
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,820
in exchange
for bringing young Winifred

1025
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:40,950
back home to them.

1026
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,390
I have the papers,
all signed and legal.

1027
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,400
Gives me the rights
to the forest

1028
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,790
and everything in it.

1029
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,130
Don't be alarmed.

1030
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:51,130
I'll let you stay here...
on my land

1031
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,300
if you prove cooperative.

1032
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,400
Cooperative?

1033
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,100
I want you to take me
to the spring.

1034
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,340
I don't know what you mean.

1035
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,040
Don't insult me, Mr. Tuck.

1036
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,910
It's immediately clear to me

1037
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:10,920
that the water's powers
have been wasted on...

1038
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,920
unimaginative people like you.

1039
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,920
I intend to make

1040
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,980
this fountain of youth,
as the simpletons would call it

1041
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:20,020
available to those
who deserve it...

1042
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,030
for a price, of course.

1043
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:27,630
You'll die of old age
before I'll take you.

1044
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:29,100
Is that so?

1045
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,660
Then, perhaps Winifred will!

1046
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:31,640
JESSE:
No!

1047
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:32,110
(fires)

1048
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:32,800
(grunts)

1049
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,000
Jesse!

1050
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,030
(groans)

1051
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,190
# #

1052
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,220
(whispering):
Yes!

1053
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,260
Bravo!

1054
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,900
Come now, Winifred.

1055
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,030
I'm feeling thirsty.

1056
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,630
Show me where the spring is.

1057
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,730
Perhaps I'll let you have
a drink.

1058
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,270
After all...

1059
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,320
...then we can spend...
eternity together.

1060
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:16,710
- (yelps)
- (screams)

1061
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,920
(gasping)

1062
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,380
(moans softly)

1063
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,100
Winnie, Winnie, come here.

1064
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,400
It's okay. It's okay, I gotcha.

1065
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:46,170
(crying)

1066
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:50,180
(dogs barking in distance)

1067
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,880
Pa.

1068
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,910
(dogs barking louder)

1069
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,770
(barking continuing)

1070
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,570
There they are!

1071
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,510
Winnie Foster!

1072
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,940
MAN:
I see her!

1073
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,880
I got her!

1074
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:15,110
Circle around to the right!

1075
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,110
Watch the water!

1076
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,200
Go!

1077
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,270
Don't let anyone get away!

1078
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,750
Jesse, come on.

1079
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:20,750
ROBERT:
Winnie!

1080
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,770
MAN:
Block that trail!

1081
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,790
It's my father.

1082
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,650
(men shouting)

1083
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,990
MAN:
Keep them alive!

1084
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,890
(dogs barking)

1085
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:31,260
Be careful of the girl!
Winnie!

1086
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,960
Let's go!

1087
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,870
Wait...

1088
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:41,240
Get on.

1089
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:42,970
MAN:
Behind the house, men!

1090
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:45,670
He's setting the house on fire!

1091
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,340
Winnie!

1092
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:49,370
You're all right.
You're all right.

1093
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:50,380
(crying)

1094
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:52,240
We found you. You're safe.

1095
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,380
You're safe now.

1096
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,010
Everything's all right.

1097
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,020
Winnie.

1098
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,020
(men shouting)

1099
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,540
Hyah!

1100
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:09,100
(men shouting)

1101
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,620
(dogs barking)

1102

1103
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,420
NARRATOR:
The hall clock chimed the hour.

1104
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:35,080
Outside, the wind was still.

1105
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,420
Everything, it seemed,
was waiting.

1106
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,330
(music box melody playing)

1107
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,460
(feet pounding rhythmically)

1108
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,470
(music droning)

1109
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:06,480
(clock ticking)

1110
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,560
ROBERT:
We just want to understand
what happened.

1111
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,570
(sighs)

1112
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,970
Winnie... try, please.

1113
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,820
They didn't kidnap me.

1114
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,480
I was with them
because I wanted to be.

1115
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,890
- (fan snaps)
- She doesn't know

1116
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,550
what she's saying.

1117
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,920
The Tucks were kind to me.

1118
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,930
They're my friends.

1119
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,860
ROBERT:
If they didn't kidnap you,
why on earth

1120
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,730
did that woman club that man
over the head with a shotgun?

1121
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:52,030
Because Mae Tuck
was protecting me.

1122
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,760
MAN:
Doesn't matter anyway.

1123
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,570
That fella died.
It's a murder charge now.

1124
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,300
I didn't much like the man

1125
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:01,540
but that won't stop
that poor woman from hanging.

1126
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,740
Miss is an eyewitness.

1127
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,080
She'll have to testify.

1128
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,640
Oh, my God.

1129
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,150
(footsteps departing)

1130
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,450
(hinges creaking)

1131
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:14,460
(door slams)

1132
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,690
I figured you might want this.

1133
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,460
Doesn't exist,
far as I'm concerned.

1134
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,620
(sighs)

1135
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,630
I sure am sorry about all this.

1136
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,630
Good day.

1137
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:26,330
Thank you, Henry.

1138
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,140

1139

1141
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,450
(wind blowing)

1142
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,820
(grunting)

1143
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:02,860
(whispering):
Winnie.

1144
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:07,110
Jesse!

1145
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,640
Oh, it's you.

1146
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,340
I was afraid
I would never see you again.

1147
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,870
I need you to help me.

1148
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,550
I need you to help us.

1149
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,210
Mae can't go to the gallows.

1150
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,880
She won't die.

1151
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,950
She can't die.

1152
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:26,590
They're going to find out
our secret.

1153
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,060
We have to get them out.

1154
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,670
(thunder crashing)

1155
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,750
WINNIE:
Help me!

1156
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,750
(pounding on glass)

1157
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,750
Please, help me!

1158
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:50,750
Somebody, help me!

1159
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:52,650
Please, someone help!

1160
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:53,750
(lively melody plays)

1161
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:54,760
Please! Help!

1162
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:55,920
All right.

1163
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,590
Help me, please!

1164
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,680
All right!

1165
01:12:58,730 --> 01:12:59,690
Help!

1166
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:01,750
PI... Please!

1167
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,660
Help me! You have to stop them!

1168
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,720
They're after me!

1169
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:07,030
Miss F... Miss Fo...
Who's after you?

1170
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:08,130
The people who kidnapped me!

1171
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:09,540
They're going
to take me away again!

1172
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:10,730
My parents couldn't stop them!

1173
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,400
They're right outside!

1174
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,710
You have to stop them, please!

1175
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:15,710
Help!

1176
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,340
They'll kill me if they find me!

1177
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,400
Please, they're going
to kill me, please!

1178
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:20,570
Stay right there!

1179
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,780
I'll handle this.

1180
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,110
Hurry!

1181
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,620
(thunder rumbling)

1182
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,380
Help!

(thunder crashing)

1187
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,410
Come out and meet your doom!

1188
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:46,910
(thunder crashing)

1189
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,140
Hell is upon you!

01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,110
(thunder rumbling)

1191
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:54,480
Stop right there!

1192
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:58,110
You're under arrest!

1193
01:13:58,150 --> 01:13:59,380
(thunder crashes)

1194
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,410

1195
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,980
Come on, we have to hurry.

1196
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:06,260
The boys are outside.

1197
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,920
Stay back, now!

1198
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,300
I'll shoot!

1199
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,330
(yelps)

1200
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:16,230

(thunder rumbling)

1207
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,530
(thunder rumbling continuing)

(lively music ends)

(door shuts)

1210
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:03,120
My dear, sweet Winnie.

1211
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:06,020
What I wouldn't do to keep you.

1212
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:13,190
I wish you were ours...
for Jesse.

1213
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:16,530
For all of us.

1214
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:20,430
(crying):
You have to hurry
and get away from here.

1215
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,170
JESSE:
Winnie...

1216
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:25,200
Winnie, come with me.

1217
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,430
There's nothing for you here.

1218
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:27,670
We can be together forever.

1219
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:30,700
If she comes with us,
they'll hunt us down.

1220
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,680
They'll never stop looking.

1221
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,770
Tuck is right.

1222
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,080
If I go with you

1223
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,090
it'll be too dangerous
for all of you.

1224
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,490
I can't go without you.

1225
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,860
(crying)

1226
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:52,860
You have to.

1227
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:58,770
Go back to the spring.

1228
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:00,400
Drink from it.

1229
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,780
When it's safe...
I'll come back for you.

1230
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,400
Will you?

1231
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:07,780
I have to show you
the Eiffel Tower, don't I?

1232
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:12,250
1,652 steps to the top.

1233
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:13,590
Winnie...

1234
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,520
until we're together again...

1235
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,790
wake up with the dawn.

1236
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:21,560
I will.

1237
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,690
We got to go...
before it's too late.

1238
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:36,540
(straps snap)

Winnie Foster...

1241
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:43,940
I will love you
till the day I die!

DOCTOR (whispering):
She's going fast

1246
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,630
but you can have a couple
of minutes with her.

1247
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,000
(footsteps)

1248
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:40,940
How are you?

Mother?

1266
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:19,070
I was just wondering

1267
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:22,100
what it is about these woods
you love so much.

1268
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,280
Mother, are you all right?

01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:19,460
I just wanted to keep you
my little girl forever.

1282
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:23,400
(sobbing)

1283
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,410
(water trickling)

1284
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,430
# #

1285
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:40,080
# #

1286
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,420
(frog croaking)

1287
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,970
JESSE (echoing):
Go back to the spring.

1288
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,770
When it's safe,
I'll come back for you.

1289
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:08,110
ANGUS:
What we Tucks have,
you can't call it living.

1290
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:11,450
We just... are.

1291
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:16,650
We're like rocks stuck
at the side of a stream.

1292
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,290
(birds twittering)

1293
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:34,470
(motor running)

1294
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:38,000
NARRATOR:
The first weeks of summer
were long over.

1295
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,080
There was a feeling

1296
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,450
that the wheel
was turning again...

1297
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:49,780
...slowly now,
but soon to go faster.

1298
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,460
Winnie and her family
left Treegap to see the world.

1299
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,430
She wasn't certain
what herjourney might bring

1300
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,450
but this much she knew...

1301
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:16,140
it would be something
of her own choosing.

1302
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:21,850
(bell tolling)

1303
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,980
# #

1304
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,990
# #

1305
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:48,940
# #

1306
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,780
(engine stops)

1307
01:22:56,790 --> 01:23:00,890
For some, time passes slowly.

1308
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:05,020
An hour can seem an eternity.

1309
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:09,770
For others,
there's never enough.

1310
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:14,240
For Jesse Tuck,
it didn't exist.

1311
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:36,450
Tuck said it to Winnie
the summer she turned 15:

1312
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:41,720
Do not fear death,
but rather the unlived life.

1313
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,820
You don't have to live forever.

1314
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,060
You just have to live.

1315
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,430
And she did.
