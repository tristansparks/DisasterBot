1
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:28,250
I've been thinking about what you
said about that concrete goal.

2
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:34,105
And?

3
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:36,805
I think, I've nailed it.

4
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,279
I'm feeling really good about this one, Al.

5
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,469
Lay it on me.

6
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,413
- It's a girl.
- Cool! What's she like?

7
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:48,666
You know, smart, beautiful, popular...

8
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,021
A classic TGFY.

9
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:54,035
- Too Good For You, Al.

10
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:56,635
- But not for you?

11
00:02:56,735 --> 00:03:01,691
Well, I'm sort of outside the whole highschool
foodchain at this point, wouldn't you say?

12
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,878
- So you gonna ask her out?
- Ask her out?

13
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,460
No. Bad idea, no.

14
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,500
I mean...

15
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,073
Where's the therapeutic value in that?

16
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:19,390
- So, what's the plan?
- Simple.

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,869
I'm gonna have fun with her.

18
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,233
- Fun? What's that mean?

19
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,233
- Fun?

20
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,192
Fun means fun. Right?

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,192
Don't over think it, Al.

22
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,654
It's been nice knowing you.

23
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:40,380
- Next week?
- You know what, Al? You've made so much progress here,

24
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:42,239
- I think you're ready to face the world on your own now.
- Keith?

25
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:45,141
Don't worry, Al. You can cope.

26
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,102
Keep it in mind!

27
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:04,990
- Yo, Anderson! What's up?

28
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:08,497
- Not much, how are you?
- I'm good you know, I'm just chilling.

29
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,127
Can't believe they did that!

30
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,458
- Hi!

31
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,058
- Hello!

32
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,889
- You're Rafael, right?
- Yeah. And you're...?

33
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,502
- Natalie... Anderson.
- Oh, head of...

34
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:50,402
Everything.

35
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:53,638
- I try to keep busy, yes.
- All work and no play?

36
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,744
None. Zero.

37
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,765
- So you're working now?
- Oh, absolutely. It's a Key Club...

38
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,467
We're checking on the stranger students
making sure they're adjusting okay.

39
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:05,841
- Well I'm having it tough...
- I can tell.

40
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:09,566
- You've only made about 50 or 60 new friends.
- Hey, brother.

41
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,272
- 61.
- Yeah. It's nice to know somebody cares.

42
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,468
- Rain...

43
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,468
- Yeah.

44
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,654
- Rain...
- Natalie, come on!

45
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:31,586
Alright, so I'm gonna go.
It's nice meeting you. I'll talk to you later.

46
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,465
- Come on, let's go!

47
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,217
-Coming!
-Ciao...

48
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:59,055
Zach! Breakfast is on the table!

49
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,139
- Natalie! Please get him up!
- Okay, okay!

50
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:13,617
Zach! Wake up!

51
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,772
Didn't come home!

52
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:22,039
- Morning!
- Morning!

53
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,543
Natie! Miles is a lefty, you're gonna
have to work in your backhand!

54
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,752
We know, we're gonna spend the whole
practice filling backhand today.

55
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:36,008
- According to my records last year...
- I'm all over it, Dad.

56
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,588
- ...she got you with her serve. 11 aces.
- ...aces. Thanks for reminding me.

57
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,103
- Natie's quicker now.
- If you beat her, your ranking jumps at least 3 places.

58
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:46,742
- What's this "if" about?
- Bye.

59
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,277
- Natie, sit down have some breakfast!
- I've got Key Club this morning, Mom.

60
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,330
You need have some protein. Sit down, please!

61
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:53,885
I have a bar.

62
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:56,837
- A bar is not a breakfast.
- Bye!

63
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,266
And as for the states of
attraction experiments...

64
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,543
The couples are:
Hobbs, Mertin; Carlens, Stevens,

65
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,293
Brand, Aldridge; Anderson and
Zetterstrom; Brandon, Davins...

66
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:29,800
- Zetterstrom?

67
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:33,300
- I haven't lied to you this far. I'm not gonna start now.

68
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,577
You gonna help?

69
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,334
- We don't need that for this.

70
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:54,934
- Look, you're not gonna be disagreable, are you?

71
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,668
'Cause Walt specifically promised
me an agreeable lab partner.

72
00:07:58,703 --> 00:07:59,600
- Walt?

73
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,200
- You need to relax.

74
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,729
- Actually I need to learn this.
- Because why?

75
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:07,865
Because you have to get a four on your AP exam
if you wanna get a college credit, in case you didn't you know.

76
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,390
Then you'll be ahead of the game, right?

77
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:12,962
Then I can focus on the things I'm
good at and keep up my GPA.

78
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,600
Okay, so we need to fill this one with
sodium-tiosulphate and this one with nitrate solution...

79
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:18,397
Gotta keep up that GPA.

80
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:21,630
- It's kinda help if you ever wanna get a job.
- A job?

81
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,345
- Can we just do the lab?

82
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:25,345
- I'd love to! Let's do the lab!

83
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:31,900
Except you're about ten years into the future.

84
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,656
We don't need chemistry, we...

85
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,131
...we need time travel

86
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Mr. Miles, this is AP.

87
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:43,537
Keith is actually pretty sharp
when he applies himself.

88
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,043
Okay...

89
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:46,651
- But we kind of...

90
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,352
- Lack chemistry?

91
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:51,586
- Yeah.

92
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,686
- Try to make it work, okay?

93
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,972
- About this Natalie Anderson thing...
- Yes?

94
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:07,599
Walter, she's a complete anal compulsive control freak!
How do you expect me to work with that?

95
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,898
- But Keith, you were who...
- I'm kidding. Kidding.

96
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:13,320
We're in pretty good shape.

97
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:18,580
Who the hell do you think you are?

98
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,500
Who do you think I am?

99
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:41,474
Hey, Miss Key Club!

100
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:43,363
Hey!

101
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,559
- So how are you adjusting?
- Oh, well, you tell me how am I doing?

102
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,247
Well, you only got a 98 percent
on the history midterms...

103
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:53,109
...so you're pretty much falling apart

104
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:56,000
I hate people like you.

105
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:59,244
Hey, so listen, are you gonna be at the brick again, friday?

106
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,507
- Are you going?
- It could happen.

107
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,236
Alright, Keith.

108
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:10,580
Thanks, man!

109
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,836
Who's that guy?

110
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:17,874
Oh...

111
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,011
...he's just my lab parner. Nobody.

112
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,586
- So you don't remember?
- What?

113
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,257
Well, I sat behind you on the sixth great play

114
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:34,300
You were the princess and
I was Russian soldier number three.

115
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,649
- I don't remember that.
- Of course not.

116
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,000
Princess never remembers the little people.

117
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:43,451
- Excuse me, well I'll cry for you.
- You should!

118
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,100
You should cry for me from
your early-decision tower.

119
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:52,783
It's posted in the front office.

120
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:55,409
- Why do they do that?
- Why Duke?

121
00:10:57,186 --> 00:11:01,208
- Great faculty, division one, that kind of stuff
- I'm sure, you get what you pay for.

122
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,212
- Actually I have a partial scholarship.
- Ah, that's right.

123
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,168
- There goes the positive...
- Tennis.

124
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:13,698
So they basically give you a bunch of money
for hitting a ball over a net.

125
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,533
Something like that.
Where did you apply?

126
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:18,868
Nowhere.

127
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,900
- Not going to college?
- Not in Judeo Christian sense. No, I'm not.

128
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,703
So, what are you doing after graduation?

129
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,933
The sky's the limit.

130
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:32,031
That's informative.

131
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,169
- Why are you taking an AP class if you...?
- I haven't picked.

132
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,760
Then "Advance Placement" or what?

133
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,276
- I'm sure there's a very simple explanation.
- Of course there is Natalie

134
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,560
and you're not gonna stop until you figure. it out.

135
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,207
That's on like a challenge. You're on.

136
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:55,496
So this's all based on one little conversation.

137
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:57,407
You don't even know if he'll be there tonight.

138
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,297
Oh, he'll definitely be there.

139
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,966
Oh, your power of positive thinking?

140
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,400
- Hey, Brooke.
- Howdy?

141
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,702
- Hey, Nat, can I borrow ten bucks?
- For what?

142
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:10,300
- Come on, I'll pay you back tomorrow.
- Get out!

143
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:12,566
Let's go!

144
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,599
- It's really cool. What happened?
- Who turned off the music?

145
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:30,209
- Can I help you?
- Ahh, yeah.

146
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,966
- Who's that guy?
- What is he doing?

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,467
Buddy, relax, you'll like it! I promise! Listen!

148
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,266
What, you think you can change that, huh?

149
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,799
Because you'll like it. See?

150
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:44,450
I'm just kidding buddy,
Just have a good time! Alright?

151
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:45,756
Senorita, let's go!

152
00:12:56,218 --> 00:13:01,166
- What? Oh, oh, no...
- Turn away! Hey welcome back!

153
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:15,465
- Interesting choice of music.
- Yeah? Can you keep up?

154
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,444
'Course.

155
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:28,965
So what do you think you're gonna do after college?

156
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,834
I'm gonna own my own record label.

157
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:34,055
- You think big.
- Why not?

158
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,147
What about you, Natalie?

159
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:42,122
Oh, I wanna run a magazine.
I wanna be the editor.

160
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Yeah.

161
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:46,753
Run a magazine. Why not?
Why not do something amazing?

162
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:49,720
- Hey there's the whole world out there.
- Everybody here just wanna go to state.

163
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:53,525
- No one wants to do anything, you know try anything new.
- Yeah.

164
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,777
Keith.
Keith!

165
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:15,480
- The lab report is due tomorrow!
- Ah, yes!

166
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:19,677
But the real pressing question is
how is Rafael Marquez? Your boyfriend.

167
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,012
He's not!

168
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:25,327
Great choice that Rafael!
Brainy stud! Perfect guy! Can't go wrong!

169
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:26,420
You were at the Brick!

170
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:28,004
No.

171
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:31,596
But you were.

172
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:35,778
- If you weren't then how would you know?
- Because that's where everyone goes.

173
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:38,708
- What about the lab report?

174
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:40,193
- Hop in!

175
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:43,580
- Come on, come on! I do my best work while I'm driving.
- I have your book.

176
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,482
By heating tin metal...

177
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,014
...in air

178
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,541
...at a high temperature

179
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:58,030
we are able to produce a tin-oxygen product
called...

180
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:00,912
Wait!

181
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:06,000
So we need to convert the masses to moles then
divide the greater mole quantity by the lesser.

182
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:11,590
Okay, so... 0.0173 tin,

183
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,453
and 0.0350 oxygen.

184
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:16,387
So the mole ratio is?

185
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:19,300
Mole ratio? What's that?

186
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:21,560
- It's the thing you have to figure out.

187
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:23,900
- But you are already know the answer.

188
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,380
Oh, come on, you're being a jerk!
I gotta be back in fifteen.

189
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:28,538
What's the rush?

190
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:32,779
 We're here in a yellow truck,
a road ahead of us and nothing but opportunities.

191
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,590
- Okay, what opportunities...?
- Choose a place!

192
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,124
- Pick a place! Right now! At random!

193
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,725
- Okay, I choose...

194
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:41,610
...the third point on our lab report
calculating the mole ratio.

195
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:44,499
I can't concentrate driving in a straight
line like this, this is not gonna work.

196
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,175
- Then turn!
- Where?

197
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:47,044
Anywhere.

198
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:48,533
Whoa!

199
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,942
Very funny.

200
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,861
The mole ratio therefore is 2:1.

201
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:57,729
But now we need to find the potential
oxidation numbers of tin and oxygen.

202
00:15:58,568 --> 00:15:59,800
Which are?

203
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:03,200
It's time for our picnic scene.

204
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,480
Keith!

205
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,450
There he is! How's it going?

206
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,379
Move along, dear!

207
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,860
In case you haven't heard, picnics
they usually take place outdoors.

208
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,643
Oh, is that what it says
in the official picnic rule book?

209
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,730
This isn't funny.

210
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:43,985
Do you think our check is ready?
I..I know pumpkin love, you know I'm pissed off too.

211
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,840
Can you believe this shit?
It's been three months since that accident.

212
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,730
The nerve...

213
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,455
- Take me back to school! Now!
- Yeah! Let's get back to the library

214
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,400
and finish our lab report in a safe,
acceptable way like everybody else.

215
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:06,160
Bone grafts are really starting to kick in now.

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,020
Hey, Ralph!

217
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:23,666
No, thanks.

218
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:28,230
- You said 2:1 right for the mole ratio?
- Yeah.

219
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,560
Duke.

220
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,200
- They'll give you a job in a place like this one day?
- God, no.

221
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:41,126
- My dad used to work in a place like this.
- Ah, yes. Daddy Anderson.

222
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,325
An accountant?

223
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,484
A salesman?

224
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:47,185
A Norwegian fisherman!

225
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:51,677
District manager for a phone company.
You're not very good at reading minds.

226
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:54,320
Well that's 'cause I wasn't really trying.

227
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,345
He manages stacks of paper. Moving them from
side to side every day, he hates his job.

228
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,532
When he was your age he dreamed of
going to Duke but they rejected him.

229
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:18,115
So he poured over every detail of your application,
night after night until you finally got it right.

230
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,700
Natalie Anderson, the star of the household,
who loves being in the center of the attention.

231
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:28,600
She just wished it didn't mean having
to play tennis all of the time.

232
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:30,410
How am I doing?

233
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,190
Okay...

234
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,000
It's actually not so bad.

235
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,600
Can I help you?

236
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:59,300
Oh, we're just...waiting for Mr. Richardson.
He said he had to finish a phone call.

237
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,733
Okay.

238
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,490
- Goddamn that Richardson!
- Yeah...

239
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,310
Who's he think he is, that little monkey?

240
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:13,413
I'm sick of this shit! You know what , baby?
We're going straight to the top!

241
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:15,820
We're getting this littlemonkey ass FIRED!

242
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:23,480
- ...lame excuses, bullshit! Never pay out.
- We just have to be patient, honey!

243
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:29,756
Okay, so you're an only child.
Your Mom works for a diaryfresh. Your Dad is a...

244
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:34,430
...a, the sir in construction and you live
in a ranch house. How am I doing?

245
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:38,402
Actually I have two brothers, three sisters,

246
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:42,989
Dad works in real estate, mom helps him out
and we live in a farmhouse.

247
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,960
A big old farmhouse.

248
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,281
Where?

249
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:55,850
- Where do you live?
- Beaver Creek, off the Route 10.

250
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:58,926
That old white house?

251
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,215
- With the big front porch?
- With the big front porch.

252
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,355
Oh, that's such a great place.

253
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,210
That's where I live.

254
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:10,720
Okay, this is nice, but that's not
enough to fill up two pages.

255
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:13,635
Okay, but this is all the
pictures that we have.

256
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:17,790
Oh, really? Okay, well then why don't you just
draw something, and throw it on page 2..

257
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,250
...because this is not gonna fit with what's...

258
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,980
- Okay, I'll take some more, okay?
- Okay, thank you.

259
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:29,980
- So, were you with the freak?
- He's not a freak. Did Raff come?

260
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:34,217
- Well, you said that you'll back to be there.
- It wasn't actually a definite plan.

261
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,912
I told to him you had to bait.

262
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,525
Did he say anything?

263
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:41,099
Oh, just that his parents are going out
tonight and he wanted to have a pool-party.

264
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:44,534
- Cool.
- And he sounded really pissed that you blew him off.

265
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:47,929
- Natalie, what are you doing with what's his face?
- A lab report.

266
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:51,966
Oh, really? And you just decided it'll be fine
if you left me here to deal with all this shit?

267
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,634
- I lost track of time.
- Because the lab report was so exciting?

268
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,444
I had to get it down. What's your problem?

269
00:20:57,561 --> 00:21:00,257
- I'm just having a really shitty day.
- What?

270
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:03,830
- Skinny envelope.
- Notre Dame? Oh, shit!

271
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:06,807
- Wait-listed.
- Really?

272
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:10,600
Oh, they accept like three percent from the waitlists.
It's basically rejection.

273
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:13,777
- No, no, we can add stuff to the application.
- Yeah, and what good is that gonna do?

274
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,208
Well you tell them it's your first choice school...

275
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:18,730
...we'll get another letter of recommendation
from the faculty and make this happen.

276
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,766
- Your power of positive thinking?

277
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:22,678
Right!

278
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,490
Hey, Raff.

279
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,023
Who else is gonna go?
I do have a tennis match.

280
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,849
Maybe afterwards, if there's time.

281
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,860
Okay. Bye!

282
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,240
Everything is totally under control.

283
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,340
Atta girl!

284
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:05,033
Yeah! Go, Natalie!

285
00:22:53,601 --> 00:23:01,522
Van der Waals' states of attraction experiment. Okay,
A myriad of forces causes into molecular attractions.

286
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:08,390
The strength of these attractions is dependent on
several factors. Understanding these forces is vital to..

287
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:10,030
Oh, God!

288
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,545
- Be careful, would you?
- Am I gonna be in trouble for that?

289
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,380
Are you gonna punish me for this?

290
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:21,643
- I might have to.

291
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:24,644
- 'Cause you know how I feel about all that stuff.

292
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,980
Look, partner, you know the deal.

293
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:32,566
But those spiky heels really hurt me...

294
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:37,789
Keith, you've been a bad boy..

295
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,562
..now you're gonna pay the price.

296
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:46,612
Do you mind?

297
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,449
- So we're on five P.M.?
- For what?

298
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,499
- A bowling-scene.
- Bowling? Serious?

299
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:57,596
I'm going out.

300
00:23:58,384 --> 00:23:59,162
Tomorrow?

301
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:00,718
Keith, I can't.

302
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:01,718
It's not a date.

303
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,380
- Keith, maybe sometime...
- Friday?

304
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:08,012
I'll just schedule it with your assistant!

305
00:24:09,938 --> 00:24:11,300
Okay, you do that!

306
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:27,056
You rewrote it?

307
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:30,574
I swapped the second and third paragraphs
and I got rid of the stuff about the history project.

308
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:33,675
It's a little bullshitty, you don't really need it.
But a few other tweaks too.

309
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:34,989
- Great!
- I'm sending it to you right now.

310
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,186
- Yes sir, editor in chief!
- Natalie, phone!

311
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:39,500
I gotta go. It looks really really good.

312
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:41,400
- Won't make a difference.
- No, this will work! It will!

313
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:42,400
Got it.

314
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:44,632
- Alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye!
- Bye!

315
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:51,688
- Hello?
- It would not be a date.

316
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:56,530
- Who is this?
- It's only bowling. Come on, what are you so afraid of?

317
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:00,189
Keith... hi!

318
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,934
Look, I'll pick you up at five P.M. tomorrow after school.

319
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:06,207
Did you happen to do the homework?

320
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,346
Homework?

321
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:10,198
 ...Homework?

322
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,700
It's your turn to write up
the chem lab notes, remember?

323
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:16,267
- You're screwing with my grade here.
- Yeah and you're changing the subject!

324
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:18,180
I told you, I have plans.

325
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:19,964
Alright, look, you'll be home by nine o'clock...

326
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:22,258
...plenty of time for a date afterwards.

327
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:26,000
- I'll see you in school!
- What... maybe.

328
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,288
With the lab notes...

329
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:33,766
- So who's on the phone?
- Oh, my lab partner.

330
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:36,507
- Did you have a nice time?
- Yeah.

331
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:39,837
- What's his name?
- Keith.

332
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:45,616
- Keith? Oh, I thought...
- Rafael. His name is Rafael.

333
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:47,430
- The South-American boy?
- Yes.

334
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:50,500
Well you should invite him for dinner sometime.
We'd love to meet him.

335
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,783
Okay. Sure.

336
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:54,783
He's really nice.

337
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:59,040
- So who is Keith?
- Oh, he's nobody. He's just my lab partner.

338
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,958
"A: It's not a date.
B: You are my lab partner.

339
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,176
C: Just to see..."

340
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:10,907
Clever.

341
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,781
"D: Bowling is the most popular sport in
America and it is important that we fit in.

342
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:22,050
E: It's not and will never be a date."
What is he, he's like stalking you, or something?

343
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,567
- So what should I do about him?
- Oh, simple...

344
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:26,886
Ping!

345
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:33,813
Okay, your papers on the
"Great Gatsby" are due in two weeks.

346
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:36,979
For those of you without a calculator,
that's May 4th.

347
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,032
The way write to write the paper?
Is to go home, go into your room.

348
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:44,500
 I know it's gonna be strange for some of you,
but trust me something valuable will happen...

349
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:52,332
"The european heritage two-week-tour is a living classroom.

350
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:56,306
Students have an opportunity to
acquire a greater perspective on the world

351
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,535
and an increased enthusiasm for learning."

352
00:26:58,694 --> 00:27:03,199
Personally I'm interested in acquiring a deeper
appreciation of french wine-drinking heritage.

353
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,898
What about the Amsterdam wake and bake heritage?

354
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:10,500
Well don't we have an increased enthusiasm
for learning. It's working already.

355
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:12,430
- Sign me up, baby.
- I'm in.

356
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,020
Oh, we're totally in.

357
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:24,480
Hey, can we meet a little later tonight? Like 9.
I forgot I'm supposed to help somebody in english paper.

358
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,780
- The movie is at 8.
- Oh, shit.

359
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:32,700
- Well, we'll figure out something else.
- Thanks.

360
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:40,436
I don't know...

361
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,690
You really wanna base your relationship with
a great guy like Raff on lies and deceit?

362
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,690
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

363
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,614
You're spending a couple of
hours with your lab partner.

364
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:59,333
- What I do with Raff is not your business.
- My point exactly.

365
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,071
I thought we're going bowling.

366
00:28:02,354 --> 00:28:03,571
We're saving that!

367
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:18,438
Believe it or not, there are bowling balls at the bowling alley.
- But not like these babies.

368
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,580
Cosmo...

369
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:22,541
Patsy...

370
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:27,665
- A Walt ball.
- But we only need two.

371
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,333
If we were just bowling.

372
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:57,000
- Andy is an artist.
- That's great, but you're running out of time.

373
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,523
First things first.

374
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,531
- You're fixing it up with spare parts?
- They're all spare parts.

375
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:14,091
- We're creating life in that hadn't been matter.
- You and Andy?

376
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,522
Me and my Dad.

377
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,960
- Are you close with your Dad?
- Hold this tighter!

378
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,730
Are you?

379
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:26,143
He was alive before the days of
electronic ignition. I need him.

380
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:28,818
So this truck is...

381
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,877
It's like, your thing...

382
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,401
- Yeah, yeah, it's my thing.
- Interesting...

383
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,205
You're so talented, Keith!

384
00:29:40,005 --> 00:29:42,004
You have so much academic potential,

385
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:44,302
What are you doing wasting your time
with that damn truck?

386
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:47,920
Well, I did't say that, but... it's kind of true.

387
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:53,200
Don't listen to her, honey bun! She's just jealous.

388
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:56,730
So... she's your girlfriend.

389
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,012
Look, you're out of time.
I gotta go. No bowling tonight.

390
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:16,010
Keep going! Go around the corner!

391
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:20,300
He's prompt! I like that in a man!

392
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,773
Show up on time and leave him wanting more, baby.

393
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:25,284
Shut up! Just dirve!

394
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:41,808
Sneak down the alley to meet your boyfriend.

395
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:43,492
Sexy.

396
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:46,910
- Bye!
- I'll pick you up at four.

397
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,300
- Four?
- A.M.

398
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:51,720
He'll be gone by then, right?

399
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:56,030
What are we gonna do at 4 A.M.?

400
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:01,000
- Keith?
- It's not a date.

401
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:14,191
I'll pick you up right here!
At our secret spot!

402
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:46,694
What?
What?!

403
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:51,079
- You ever done this before?
- Kissed?

404
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:58,866
Is that gonna be a problem for you?

405
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:02,581
I just don't think this is gonna work out any more, Natalie.

406
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,725
- Oh My God!
- What? I was kidding!

407
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm kidding...

408
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,032
You know it's gonna sound really cheesy but...

409
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:19,720
- when I do that, I just wanted to be...
- Oh, no, no. I've got that all covered.

410
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,712
We'll have a heart-shaped bed that
I ordered and we have candles...

411
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,630
- You know what I'm talking about!
- I know, I know...

412
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,930
- No rush okay?
- Thanks.

413
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:31,105
Just think, years from now you're gonna have a big huge family

414
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,370
and you're gonna wanna share stories

415
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:34,847
and one of the stories will be that when you were in high school,

416
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,859
you put a bowling ball at your chemistry teacher's front porch.

417
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,837
And his name was Walt.

418
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,158
I refuse!

419
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,850
Go! Go!

420
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:51,888
Get outta here, you jerk!

421
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:20,965
- His last name is Marquez.
- It's the thought that counts.

422
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,115
- I'm gonna be so screwed.
- Ah, yeah.

423
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:45,910
- If we're caught just swallow one of these!
- It's not funny shit head!

424
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,380
So, who gets these?

425
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,100
Well, you can't give up now,

426
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,190
Patsy, you're gonna be state champion!

427
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,539
My daddy won't let me...

428
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:17,628
...Cosmo.

429
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,800
Now, what's your daddy know about your bowling?

430
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:25,087
Well, he's warning in and all
you know and to him it's just a game

431
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:28,600
- and to him, games is the devil's handiwork.
- Patsy, you're the greatest!

432
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,676
- You can make the nationals!
- I gotta respect my daddy's wishes.

433
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,333
He's had a hard life.

434
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,690
Particularly killed himself
raise us nine kids.

435
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,450
- That was my last game.
- Well, darling...

436
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:45,870
then it was my last game too.

437
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:50,499
"Dear waitress,

438
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,389
please find a home...

439
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:55,458
...for our balls.

440
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,583
Cosmo and Patsy."

441
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,666
- This is the saddest day of our lives.
- Indeed it is.

442
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:46,202
Natie!

443
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,222
- What's up?

444
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:54,182
I'm just putting in your last match.
You're now ranked 14th.

445
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:55,917
Come take a look!

446
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:56,917
I believe you.

447
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:01,060
If you stay in the top twenty,
you'll be sent for that scholarship.

448
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,459
- Dad!
- What?

449
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,017
- Did you apply the Duke?
- Actually yes I did.

450
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:11,778
I didn't get in. It was very compared of year.

451
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,658
You'd ever think about doing something different?

452
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:17,570
Different?

453
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
- For work.
- Such as?

454
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:23,301
- Something you might actually enjoy.
- Like what?

455
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,830
- Dad!
- What?

456
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:36,184
He's smart, confident, he's really hot.

457
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,350
I kinda think he's perfect.

458
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,400
- So what did you guys do last night?
- Oh, we just hung out and talked.

459
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:50,050
Few other things...
Not that!

460
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,956
It's great with Raff, there's absolutely no pressure.

461
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:57,881
- So I guess Courtney was hallucinating?
- What?

462
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:01,928
She said she saw you with Keith
Zetterstrom on state street.

463
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,699
- Oh, well I hang out with him for a little bit too.
- Oh!?

464
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:12,377
- What? I'm not allowed to have other friends?
- Not when they're stalking you.

465
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:16,874
Keith is cool, he just, he does things his own way.

466
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,733
It's kinda perfect actually.

467
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:23,790
It's Keith keeps me busy and that
way I don't get all obsessive about Raff.

468
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,200
It works so.

469
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:29,200
Alright, hey, if it works out for you,
then that's just great.

470
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,500
It does.

471
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:35,865
I gotta go. I got tennis.

472
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,566
- Bye!
- Call you later.

473
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,010
Do you speak spanish?

474
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,200
That's so cool!

475
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:49,855
- Are you learning any languages at the school?
- French.

476
00:38:54,012 --> 00:38:59,040
- So have you ever been to Italy?
- Oh, yeah, I actually I used to live there, couple years..

477
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,555
We're planning a trip there. It's my dream.

478
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:06,567
Oh, yeah! I recommend!
Florence is one of my favourite cites.

479
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:10,898
Natalie tells us that your planning in attending to Penn State.

480
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:14,023
Umm, actually it's UPENN, sir.

481
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,522
She also tells us you're quite a sportman.

482
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:24,555
Oh, yeah, I play football ever since when I was a little kid.

483
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:27,600
- Oh, you know Pete was a... tell...
- No...

484
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:31,660
Okay, Pete was a great football player in college.

485
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:34,670
I wasn't a great great football player.
But I played a little football.

486
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:36,223
Oh, soccer?

487
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,156
Football.

488
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,212
- Bon appétit!

489
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:59,930
- My uncle says we can have it any weekend next month.
- After the 14th. After APs.

490
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,420
- Sure.
- So your parents are gonna be okay with this?

491
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,155
- Yeah. Yours?
- Something can be arranged.

492
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,840
- Just you and me... and the fireplace...
- Actually...

493
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,059
...we really need to talk.

494
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,917
I need to be honest with you
about how I feel about this.

495
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,932
- What?

496
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,168
It's beautiful. It's perfect. You're perfect.

497
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:26,866
Well, I actually thought we were waiting...

498
00:40:27,914 --> 00:40:29,978
- But we can work up to it, right?
- Oh, yeah...

499
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,655
Come in!

500
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:44,520
Some guy in a truck dropped this for you.

501
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:47,320
- I got it!
- Okay.

502
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:48,360
Thanks.

503
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:54,040
- What's that?
- I don't know. Chem lab notes?

504
00:40:57,217 --> 00:41:01,013
Gross! What is this?

505
00:41:02,102 --> 00:41:04,256
- Carburator tune up kit.


506
00:41:04,741 --> 00:41:05,938
- Just what I always wanted.

507
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:09,155
"Guaranted not to raise your GPA"

508
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,545
- He's really starting to get in my nerves.
- What's that mean?

509
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:18,281
- He just does shit like this.
- Is he a little...?

510
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,052
- Something like that.
- He has a crush on you.

511
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,310
- He's crushed on his truck.
- Oh, whatever, just...

512
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,312
- ...don't encourage him.
- I don't!

513
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:31,378
- Shit!
- Are you ready to go?

514
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:33,927
- Actually I have to take a shower.
- You want me to wait?

515
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:36,334
No, that's alright. You go ahead!
I'll meet you there.

516
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:37,050
Alright. Byebye!

517
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,850
- Bye!

518
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:48,568
Keith!

519
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:50,420
We need to talk.

520
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:52,286
Hop in!

521
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:53,843
I'm not going to anywhere with you.

522
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,657
Cool, well then I'll come inside and
watch TV with Pete and Caroline.

523
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,648
No. No.

524
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:02,834
No!

525
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:08,661
- You can't just deliver shit to my house like that!
- It works, didn't it?

526
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:10,461
Listen,

527
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,875
I like you.

528
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,186
I like being friends with you.

529
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:14,608
But if we're gonna hang out from now on,

530
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:15,730
I gotta be a part of the plans!

531
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,445
- See, but there are no plans!
- Bullshit!

532
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,920
- You got a whole scenario worked out.
- Is that what you think?

533
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:22,233
- Yeah, and you can't just expect
me that drop everything

534
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:24,152
 because you decided you wanna do some...
- Well, I don't expect you to do anything!

535
00:42:25,027 --> 00:42:27,974
You're free go at anytime! In fact,

536
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:31,445
what is Nathalie Anderson doing
hanging out a truck geek like me anyway?

537
00:42:35,424 --> 00:42:36,232
This is cool.

538
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:38,813
 This is the scene
where we're at the crossroads.

539
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,130
You're being a jerk.

540
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:43,336
Oh, come on, miss "the bay queen"
Stud boyfriend, tennis champ!

541
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,420
Do you have any better things to do on a Friday night?

542
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,597
Just go, leave, get out here!

543
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:03,749
You know I thought you were different,

544
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:05,033
but you're not different.

545
00:43:05,102 --> 00:43:08,397
You're just another immature little boy!

546
00:43:08,397 --> 00:43:09,163
You're right.

547
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:13,000
I am wasting my time here.

548
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:24,323
And what about you?
Mr. Egomaniac?

549
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:28,200
Why do you always give me gifts and
writing me clever little notes all of the time?

550
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:31,522
Why don't you leave?

551
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:34,500
- Go ahead! Drive away right now!
- There's Keith! Stop, Al!

552
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:38,230
Keith!

553
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,720
Keith, guess what!

554
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:42,316
They got me Super Smash Brothers and Gran Turismo 3.


555
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,993
They're like beating each other up,

556
00:43:44,015 --> 00:43:46,616
- they got all these characters all brawling each other off...
- Hey, Billy, Al.

557
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:47,919
They got mario, and they got luigi.

558
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:52,181
Billy, how's it going buddy,
Listen, this is, this is sophie.

559
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,730
- Natalie.
- Hi! I'm Al.

560
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,848
She's a double agent. You can't trust her.

561
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:00,866
- they got all these monsters that are
battling and clashing at each other and...

562
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:02,169
- Oh, good. I'm gonna kick your ass!

563
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:05,600
I'll kick your ass!
Come on, let's get out here! Come on!

564
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,253
- Let's go to your house!
- Billy... you know... Billy...

565
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,189
I'm on specially assignment tonight, buddy.
How about tomorrow?

566
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:13,320
- Oh man, I got school tomorrow! Come on, let's go!
- Billy, we gotta go!

567
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,010
- Come on, sleep one more night there! One more!
- Billy, it's time to get in the car right now!

568
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:20,036
- My parents don't care!
- Come on! Next time.

569
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:21,500
- Oh, man...
- Atta boy.

570
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,885
- I'll talk to you, Keith?

571
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:26,885
- Hang in there, Al.

572
00:44:28,388 --> 00:44:29,500
You're doing just fine.

573
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:38,120
- I'll kick your ass!
- I'll kick your ass!

574
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,513
So how do you know them?

575
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,820
The neighborhood.

576
00:44:55,913 --> 00:44:58,625
Billy is what? Hyperactive or something?

577
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:01,509
So you're his...

578
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:05,968
Counselor?
Tutor? Something like that?

579
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,520
Such a guy...

580
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:14,999
...turns out you're a softie.

581
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:26,520
So, what is it?

582
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:31,366
Church program?
The Y? Volunteer thing?

583
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:37,485
Let's get outta here!

584
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:39,609
Come on, let's go!

585
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:43,944
Got a yellow truck

586
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:44,927
Road in front of us, and

587
00:45:47,637 --> 00:45:49,700
Nothing but opportunities, right?

588
00:46:10,113 --> 00:46:12,100
Turn right up here!
Right here! This dirt road!

589
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,722
Come on! What?

590
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:17,331
Why here?

591
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:19,846
Why?

592
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,160
It's not supposed to be a why, right?

593
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,400
What are you scared?

594
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,678
Whoa, whoa! Slow down!

595
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:37,137
Just funny!
Really funny!

596
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,950
- What?
- You chose this road.

597
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:51,535
So that's the Brick!
I've never been on this side.

598
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:54,002
Never been on that side.


599
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:56,584
You're not missing much.

600
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,530
Really? I thought you were the Brick Queen.

601
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,230
It's getting a little old.

602
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:08,660
It's all about what you're wearing and who's
hooking up with who and showing off your boyfriend.

603
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:11,237
- The essential information.
- Oh, yeah.

604
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:15,268
Down there they live and die by that crap.

605
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:21,400
But up here it's like...

606
00:47:23,189 --> 00:47:24,944
...why did I ever care.

607
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,675
But you don't...

608
00:47:33,675 --> 00:47:34,675
What?

609
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:40,445
You don't care what people think.
You're just...

610
00:47:41,343 --> 00:47:42,145
...you.

611
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:49,019
Whatever that is.

612
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:50,492
It's a good thing.

613
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,363
It's a really good thing.

614
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,333
So do you come here a lot?

615
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:04,688
Cool.

616
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:07,440
- I found your place.
- I don't know how you did.

617
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,490
Chances are probably one in a billion.

618
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:13,686
Stranger things have happened, right?

619
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:35,290
We should probably leave.

620
00:48:36,626 --> 00:48:38,760
- Yeah.
- We're lab partners.

621
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,021
- Yeah.
- This is strictly a lab partnership.

622
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:44,654
- Absolutely.
- And Walter would be very very upset right now. So...

623
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,350
- Hey, Raff!
- Hi, beautiful! Are you ready?

624
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:02,036
I'm so sorry, I just got out of the shower.

625
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:06,545
Actually... I don't really feel like
to go to the brick tonight.

626
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:10,190
- Why? What's wrong with the brick?
- Just that we've gone for the last six weeks in a row.

627
00:49:10,191 --> 00:49:12,175
I know but we've promised to Trisha,

628
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:14,342
- and you know, Robbie.
- We see them all the time.

629
00:49:14,648 --> 00:49:18,345
Well, you see me all the time.
So you're getting sick of me Natalie?

630
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:22,139
Of course I'm not getting sick of you
I'm just really beat.

631
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:25,954
Had a long day, practice after school.
I was gonna call you sooner.

632
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:30,105
Okay, it's alright. Just get some sleep
and we'll hang tomorrow, okay?

633
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,745
- Yeah, see what's happening.
- Okay.

634
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,020
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!

635
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:15,090
- Hi!
- Hi!

636
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:15,890
Natalie!

637
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:18,620
- Guess, where I'm gonna be next year!
- Notre Dame!

638
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:22,880
That's great!

639
00:50:23,832 --> 00:50:25,934
We have to celebrate this!

640
00:51:17,629 --> 00:51:21,600
- Okay, partner! Now I've got a scene.
- Shoot!

641
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,300
It's the scene when you tell me the truth.

642
00:51:26,103 --> 00:51:27,690
The big confession scene.

643
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:32,650
What are you doing after you finish highschool?
Really.

644
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,625
- I'm going to London.
- London?

645
00:51:39,206 --> 00:51:42,210
Me too! With Raff and Brooke and Travis!
We should meet up!

646
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:43,837
Not that London.

647
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:46,899
London, Ontario.

648
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,864
There's a classic truckshow
there every year in July.

649
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:54,223
- So you really are truck geek.
- You see I open up to you and you dump on me.

650
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:58,700
No, just because I know you have dreams
more than a truck show.

651
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:04,988
- The sky's the limit, right?
- Yeah, actually it is.

652
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:05,900
Are you sure?

653
00:52:09,244 --> 00:52:11,734
I'm sure you sell yourself short.

654
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:27,360
Are we...?

655
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,360
Are we moving?

656
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:32,771
We are moving!

657
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:35,704
It's like we're moving through space on a mission.

658
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:37,200
Keith, we have a problem.

659
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:41,400
- I think, there's an entry of other space craft.
- Keith! Get up! You gotta get up! Come on!

660
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:44,530
- Keith, it's gonna go over! Get up! Come on!
-And it's taken over the body of our trusted co-pilot

661
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,407
- Natalie Anderson.
- Keith! It's gonna go over!

662
00:52:46,408 --> 00:52:48,136
- "It's gonna go over!"
- Come on! What are you doing?

663
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:49,467
She keeps saying that.

664
00:52:49,487 --> 00:52:51,189
- You're gonna get yourself killed!
- "Keith, stop it!"

665
00:52:51,189 --> 00:52:52,501
Keith!

666
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,070
- Natalie Anderson...
- Keith, Hurry up!

667
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,439
Shit! Keith!

668
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:59,016
"Get up, Keith."

669
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:00,494
"..Keith,  get up."

670
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:04,154
Keith, hurry, get up!
you're gonna get killed! Keith!

671
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,697
Stop the truck! Keith!

672
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:14,845
What the hell was that?

673
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:16,219
Are you crazy?!

674
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,660
You don't do shit like that,
You could get yourself killed!

675
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:20,952
Not to mention what would've
happened to my truck...

676
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,650
Oh! Oh, yeah!

677
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,220
Did you wanna go over?

678
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,010
- I wasn't even close.
- Yes, you were!

679
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:43,836
- You don't know how close is.
- Don't give me one of your stupid lines!

680
00:53:44,027 --> 00:53:45,615
I know what close is!

681
00:53:52,206 --> 00:53:54,312
Good night, partner.

682
00:54:00,076 --> 00:54:01,640
Take care of yourself, okay?

683
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:49,000
TRIPTOPAX XR IS INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION

684
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:22,614
No, not C, Z.
Zetterstrom.

685
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:28,812
Z, E, T, T, E...
Are you sure?

686
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:33,111
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

687
00:56:34,273 --> 00:56:38,614
- Using yourself cellphone in school property?
- Hey... the heck?!

688
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:41,700
It was Duke, apparently there is
a problem with my transcript.

689
00:56:41,707 --> 00:56:43,218
- Oh, is everything okay?

690
00:56:43,218 --> 00:56:46,144
- Actually now, I have to go wait in line
at the office and deal with this.

691
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:47,200
Sucks.

692
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,100
- Bye!
- Bye!

693
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,980
Look, he's been gone for a few days now,

694
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,240
so I was thinking I should call him you know
get him caught up in the homework and all.

695
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,350
I'm sorry, we don't give out that information.

696
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,892
But it's kind of an emergency.

697
00:56:59,893 --> 00:57:01,687
I mean Keith, he's falling way behind,

698
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:04,088
...and it's affecting me.
I need to prepare for the APs.

699
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:06,410
You'll have to speak to Mr. Miles regarding that.

700
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:09,321
Okay, look, he's my friend, you know.

701
00:57:09,321 --> 00:57:12,240
 He's given me his number,
I just lost it. It's really not a big deal.

702
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,000
- I'm sorry, I can't.

703
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:16,109
- Where is he? Why doesn't he come?

704
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,770
I'm trying to learn stuff,
it's like he doesn't care!

705
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,740
I think Keith's having a tough time at the moment.

706
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:26,198
- Tough how?
- Thanks.

707
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,566
That's all I can say really.

708
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:30,377
Well.. is there anything I can do?

709
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,526
I knew this was a bad idea.

710
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,366
- What?

711
00:57:36,642 --> 00:57:37,898
- What?

712
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,096
Partnering you guys.

713
00:57:40,893 --> 00:57:41,800
But it was random.

714
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,690
He chose me?

715
00:57:49,906 --> 00:57:52,512
Keith chose me?

716
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:56,099
I'll make sure he gets your notes.

717
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,773
Damn it!

718
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,299
Game. Set. Match.

719
00:58:29,143 --> 00:58:31,745
Randy Randerson manages to the semi-finals.

720
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:07,155
- You want me to come in?
- Maybe. No.

721
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,823
Shit, I don't know. I think, I just need
to get some sleep, or something.

722
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,756
You have plans with Keith?

723
00:59:15,988 --> 00:59:17,900
- Where did that come from?
- Well, do you?

724
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:21,591
As a matter in fact I have
absolutely zero plans with Keith.

725
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:24,185
- But you've been hanging with him.
- I hang with a lot of people.

726
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:26,600
Is there something wrong with that?
Am I only allowed to be seen with you?

727
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:29,230
No, no. Relax, okay?
The match is over.

728
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:33,123
Sorry.

729
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,963
Just having a really screwed up day.

730
00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:36,465
So everything's okay?

731
00:59:36,636 --> 00:59:40,794
He's just my lab partner, my friend.
Actually he's not even my friend

732
00:59:40,795 --> 00:59:43,413
- so can we just let it go?

733
00:59:44,636 --> 00:59:45,673
- Yeah, whatever.

734
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,142
So well, talk to you later.

735
01:00:07,757 --> 01:00:09,704
Natalie, we have to talk!

736
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:13,450
I lost the match.

737
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,757
Get over it, Mom!

738
01:00:14,757 --> 01:00:16,342
Natalie, come back here!

739
01:00:16,342 --> 01:00:18,967
Natalie, I am talking to you!

740
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:30,719
- Yeah?

741
01:01:30,884 --> 01:01:32,849
- Hi! Is Keith home?

742
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:34,118
- Keith?

743
01:01:34,118 --> 01:01:35,173
- I'm his lab partner.

744
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:37,770
- May I help you?
- Are you Mr. Zetterstrom?

745
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,290
- Mr. who?

746
01:01:41,021 --> 01:01:43,282
- This is the Zetterstrom house?

747
01:01:43,649 --> 01:01:45,769
My name's Don. Don Souper.

748
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:49,425
Sorry.

749
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:51,951
Wrong house.

750
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:14,306
Oh, quiz!

751
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:15,930
Sweet!

752
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,674
What timing!

753
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:20,340
Morning, Walt! Thank you.

754
01:02:33,934 --> 01:02:35,311
Hey, partner!

755
01:02:36,413 --> 01:02:38,386
Thanks for those notes,
I killed that quiz.

756
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:42,240
- Where you been the last two weeks?
- Last two weeks?

757
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:44,518
- What, do you come here every day?

758
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,600
- There's some wrong with you, isn't there?

759
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,003
Yeah, yeah there is...

760
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:52,200
...with me,
definitely with you,

761
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,452
- with this sexy little freshman right here.

762
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:56,229
- I don't wanna be funny anymore, Keith.

763
01:02:56,616 --> 01:02:59,700
Oh, well I hate to break it to you, Anderson
but you've never really been funny to begin with.

764
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,574
What are you?

765
01:03:01,888 --> 01:03:02,490
Depressed or something?

766
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:05,246
Depressed? Yeah, throw that out there.
Chicks find it incredibly sexy.

767
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:07,010
- I'm being serious, Keith.
- Why?

768
01:03:07,813 --> 01:03:09,266
It never works.

769
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,020
You could have to told me.

770
01:03:14,113 --> 01:03:15,500
Could have told you what?

771
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:18,299
That... you have problems...

772
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:21,738
You don't know the half of 'em.

773
01:03:25,026 --> 01:03:27,140
- Hey, Raff.
- What's going on?

774
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:27,945
What?

775
01:03:28,348 --> 01:03:30,127
- The jacket...

776
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:32,392
- Oh, you like it? I got it from K-Mart.

777
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,604
Raff, I was cold he lent it to me.

778
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:39,486
Oh, come on, you don't expect
him to believe that, do you?

779
01:03:39,777 --> 01:03:40,893
You see Raff,

780
01:03:41,594 --> 01:03:43,783
We're part of this jacket smuggling ring,

781
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,830
but if you're quiet enough I swear
there's a fleece in it somewhere for you.

782
01:03:46,831 --> 01:03:48,950
- Look, I'm not talking to you, okay?
- Hey, man, don't get mad at me.

783
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:52,370
- I only a supply this shit, okay? I don't create the demand...
- Shut the hell up!

784
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:55,646
Raff! Raff, it's just a jacket.
That's it! Just a jacket.

785
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,650
This is bullshit!

786
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:02,500
Raff, wait up!

787
01:04:05,182 --> 01:04:06,500
Marquez, it was a joke!

788
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:10,435
Raff! Raff!

789
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,515
- T'was just a jacket, right?
- Yes!

790
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,684
- That's it?
- Of course, that's all it was!

791
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:17,100
Raff, come on...

792
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:20,370
I've class.

793
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:27,312
- So it's all just a big joke to you, huh?
- I don't know.

794
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,150
- How is it?
- I don't know. I don't know anything anymore.

795
01:04:30,155 --> 01:04:31,620
Why did you choose me your lab partner?

796
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,100
- Me?
- Don't bullshit me! Miles told me!

797
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,800
Walter Miles is CIA, you can't trust him.

798
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,430
- Where do you live?
- What?

799
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,344
Where do you live?
You lied about it!

800
01:04:41,373 --> 01:04:43,830
- Are you losing it partner?
- You lied about everything!

801
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:46,015
'Cause you know what, I've got some
great pills that you could take.

802
01:04:46,546 --> 01:04:48,518
But I'm sure you already knew that.

803
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:46,660
I just don't understand, Natalie,
You've always been one of the school's finest students.

804
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,324
- I needed the chemistry notes.
- You know very well that's not the way to get them.

805
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:54,412
- She made a mistake.
- She's been under a lot of pressure lately...

806
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,457
with her tennis schedule and all of her homework...

807
01:05:56,458 --> 01:06:00,300
I'm sorry but defacing school property's
an automatic week suspension.

808
01:06:00,952 --> 01:06:03,000
- What? What was I supposed to do...?
- Natalie.

809
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:08,045
- I can make any exceptions to that rule.
- I needed the notes I have to take the AP!

810
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:11,045
Mr. Miles will make sure you get those notes.

811
01:06:22,654 --> 01:06:24,890
Just don't watch a mess of everything
you've worked so hard for!

812
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:26,143
Please, can we just not?

813
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,399
- If there's something you need to tell us?
- You know what, stop the car!

814
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,191
What?

815
01:06:30,192 --> 01:06:34,050
- I can't think in here. I wanna get out!
- You'll stay right where you are, missy!

816
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,186
Natalie!

817
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:45,058
What?

818
01:06:45,058 --> 01:06:46,533
 The light was red!

819
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,790
- Hi.
- Hi.

820
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:02,380
Umm, chapters 14-16 in history
and that's your math take-home test.

821
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:04,070
Okay, thanks.

822
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:06,341
Are you okay?

823
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:07,909
Fine!

824
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:11,563
- Are you gonna tell me what happened?

825
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:15,053
Had a hissy fit.

826
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:17,232
Natalie!

827
01:07:17,828 --> 01:07:19,461
You broke into Keith's locker.

828
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:20,934
I mean, really what were you looking for?

829
01:07:21,136 --> 01:07:24,600
Oh, that's just great, I'm sure
you're all just gossiping your asses off.

830
01:07:24,601 --> 01:07:26,340
No, I'm just tring to help you, okay?

831
01:07:26,346 --> 01:07:27,757
Look, Keith is a loser! Okay?

832
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:29,831
He's jealous, and he's obviously
trying to break you guys up.

833
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:32,120
- That's ridiculous!
- Raff is pissed.

834
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:33,373
You'd talked to Raff?

835
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:36,999
- No, no! Natalie, just listen to me for one second!
- Go! Go away!

836
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:37,900
Natalie!

837
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,020
Keith's a psycho!
He's gonna screw up everything!

838
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:44,912
I'm going!

839
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:48,860
- Natalie!
- I'd like to warm up by myself for once in my life, Mom.

840
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:50,878
- I'll see you at the match!
- Natalie! I'm not ready!

841
01:07:58,205 --> 01:07:59,582
Natalie.

842
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:04,604
Natalie! Natalie!

843
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:09,068
Natalie! Natalie!

844
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:10,646
What the...?

845
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:33,845
- I told you I would talk to you later.
- I wanna know what's going on!

846
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,080
What's going on is I have a match!

847
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,200
Whatever is you could tell me about it.
Okay, Natalie?

848
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:40,200
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Well, because it has to do with Keith?

849
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:42,023
- It's about me.
- Then it's about me too!

850
01:08:42,024 --> 01:08:44,850
Alright? 'cause you and I is just a little involved
in case you haven't noticed.

851
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:45,500
I need a little time.

852
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,650
If we want the lake house next weekend,
I gotta call my uncle...

853
01:08:47,651 --> 01:08:49,673
- I'll call you later!
- Natalie!

854
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:52,054
Idiot!

855
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,055
Hi!

856
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,655
- Are you Keith's dad?
- Yeah.

857
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:42,000
Keith.

858
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,494
Keith!

859
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,300
I'll get him for you.

860
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:58,196
Does he have any brothers, sisters?

861
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,083
Just two of us.

862
01:10:34,053 --> 01:10:35,204
I'm sorry.

863
01:10:35,718 --> 01:10:37,195
He doesn't wanna to see you now.

864
01:10:39,262 --> 01:10:40,500
Okay.

865
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:43,954
Thanks anyway.

866
01:12:05,743 --> 01:12:06,488
I don't...

867
01:12:07,454 --> 01:12:08,425
I don't care

868
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:09,911
where you're gonna be next year.

869
01:12:11,983 --> 01:12:14,070
I don't care if you're crazy.

870
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,965
God...

871
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,400
I just know I wanna be with you.

872
01:12:25,765 --> 01:12:28,032
I don't understand what you're doing.

873
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:38,273
It seems so pointless,
I mean everything,

874
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,820
it just seems so pointless!

875
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:43,680
But when I'm with you, it's different,

876
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,430
I don't know why.

877
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,257
So..

878
01:13:57,257 --> 01:13:59,464
..we should actually go bowling.

879
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,898
- You know like with lanes and pins.
- Yeah, we should.

880
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,100
- Maybe tomorrow?
- Maybe.

881
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,300
- Are you even gonna be in school tomorrow?
- I don't know.

882
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:12,909
- I don't know about any this actually.
- What?

883
01:14:14,186 --> 01:14:17,258
I mean a guy like me with a truck

884
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:19,000
gotta keep moving.

885
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,240
Stop it.

886
01:14:20,241 --> 01:14:22,800
I mean, you know, I'm not really one
for the whole attachment thing anyway.

887
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,052
Shut up!

888
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:25,052
You got Raff.

889
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,342
Raff's a good guy.

890
01:14:29,143 --> 01:14:30,720
Good for you.

891
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,250
Let's just forget about it.

892
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:46,168
Fuck you!

893
01:14:46,578 --> 01:14:49,139
You just did partner.

894
01:15:27,783 --> 01:15:30,300
If you just forfeit matches
what do you expect?

895
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,541
You're ranking dropped 15 points last month.

896
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:35,122
Great.

897
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,015
That's just perfect.

898
01:15:37,016 --> 01:15:40,950
I'm gonna talk to Richard Honings,
he's a big guy over at the DTTA.

899
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:45,445
No, all we need to do is to get doctor to
write a letter saying that you were injured.

900
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:47,242
But I wasn't injured.

901
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:50,677
This is a 10,000 dollars scholarship we're talking about.

902
01:15:50,677 --> 01:15:53,750
It's not my fault you wanted me to go to
the most expensive school in the universe.

903
01:15:53,752 --> 01:15:56,365
- Duke is the best you'll ever...
- Why would you sell yourself short?

904
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:58,269
I didn't even finish any other applications.

905
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,696
Honey, you didn't have to.

906
01:15:59,932 --> 01:16:01,048
You didn't want me to.

907
01:16:01,192 --> 01:16:02,626
There are a billion other schools out there.

908
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,460
I mean, I could get a job.

909
01:16:04,538 --> 01:16:07,614
- or something.
- You don't have to compromise, honey

910
01:16:07,615 --> 01:16:10,111
if we focus on this, we can get the scholarship back.

911
01:16:10,314 --> 01:16:11,430
Maybe I don't want it back.

912
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,828
Maybe I don't wanna play tennis
for six hours a day at college.

913
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:21,026
Maybe I am sick of it after 10 stupid years!
Did that ever occur to you?

914
01:16:21,587 --> 01:16:22,189
Honey!

915
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:25,485
There is no reason to give up on your dream now!

916
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,888
- Oh, are you even listening to me?
- It is almost june! It is too late!

917
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:32,356
You're right!

918
01:16:32,356 --> 01:16:34,629
Everything is just totally screwed up!

919
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:38,466
- Hey, we're not done here!
- Come right back here!

920
01:17:14,707 --> 01:17:15,300
Hi!

921
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:20,455
We met. I was with Keith.

922
01:17:20,455 --> 01:17:22,567
- Oh... hi!

923
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:26,199
How is Keith doing?

924
01:17:27,236 --> 01:17:28,582
I don't really know.

925
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:30,500
Actually I haven't seen him much.

926
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:36,276
Does he still see that little boy? Billy?

927
01:17:36,754 --> 01:17:38,323
Billy passed away.

928
01:17:39,532 --> 01:17:42,292
- May I help you, sir?
- 15 on pump number three please.

929
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:43,649
What?

930
01:17:44,457 --> 01:17:45,541
I'm sorry.

931
01:17:48,193 --> 01:17:49,709
- How do Keith know him?

932
01:17:50,427 --> 01:17:52,174
- Oh they were in chemo together.

933
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,672
- So you were his doctor?

934
01:18:00,856 --> 01:18:01,654
Counselor.

935
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:03,405
I was...

936
01:18:06,178 --> 01:18:07,970
But he's gonna be okay, right?

937
01:18:12,301 --> 01:18:13,418
How sick is he?

938
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:14,923
Tell me!

939
01:18:15,849 --> 01:18:19,252
I thought you knew. I'm really sorry.

940
01:18:30,849 --> 01:18:32,843
Keith?

941
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,744
Keith.

942
01:18:45,652 --> 01:18:46,868
Please come outside!

943
01:18:51,548 --> 01:18:55,551
Keith, come on!
Keith, open the door!

944
01:18:55,552 --> 01:18:57,970
Just talk to me please!

945
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:01,962
Keith...

946
01:19:06,323 --> 01:19:07,583
Thanks for calling.

947
01:19:08,045 --> 01:19:09,867
Sorry. I've been trying to figure things out.

948
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:12,080
Yeah? And? Did you figure it out?

949
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,838
Raff, we had a good time.
I really like you.

950
01:19:16,873 --> 01:19:18,640
- Then why are you doing this?

951
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,160
I'm just going through a lot of stuff right now.

952
01:19:20,201 --> 01:19:22,277
- Can we just leave it?
- No! We can't actually!

953
01:19:25,744 --> 01:19:29,100
I couldn't find the Caribbean mix
so I'll have to give it to you later.

954
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:31,500
Yeah, yeah, later.
I've heard that one before!

955
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:33,520
I wasn't blowing you off!

956
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,270
Okay, things got complicated.

957
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:38,297
- Yeah, when you started bullshitting me, Natalie!
- You wanna know what really happened?

958
01:19:38,397 --> 01:19:39,812
I know what happened, okay?

959
01:19:39,812 --> 01:19:42,074
You let down that little jerkoff screw with your head!

960
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,023
- Is that what do you think?
- Yes. It's obvious!

961
01:19:47,174 --> 01:19:50,600
- You've no idea what are you talking about.
- Well I would know if you told me!

962
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:51,880
- Stop it!
- What were you thinking?

963
01:19:51,881 --> 01:19:55,180
What the hell were you thinking?!
What were you giving up for that little piece of shit?

964
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:55,900
Stop it!

965
01:20:01,591 --> 01:20:03,840
You know I only hoped good things for you.

966
01:20:04,497 --> 01:20:07,395
'Cause really bad shit happens to people!

967
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:09,625
I hope to God it never happens to you!

968
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:35,464
Welcome back, bad girl!

969
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:42,452
Alright ladies, gentleman!
Please leave your final reports on my desk...

970
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:45,606
I want you to make sure your glasswares are all cleaned,
your beakers, your testtubes, if they're dirty.

971
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:49,670
You must clean them,
or you will lose points in class.

972
01:20:49,672 --> 01:20:52,520
If any items are missing, please notify me immediately.

973
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,728
Finally, make sure that your labsinks are clean
and that there is no material left in them

974
01:21:11,252 --> 01:21:13,730
Four test cubes, three beakers...

975
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:18,600
and a Bunsen burner.

976
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:25,530
Yeah, okay, everything seems to be in order. Keys?

977
01:21:29,378 --> 01:21:30,506
Natalie, key?

978
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:37,189
The end of chemistry as we know it.

979
01:21:38,658 --> 01:21:40,730
You're such a goddamn glib little actor!

980
01:21:41,626 --> 01:21:43,840
As far as I'm concerned this is
a really chickenshit goodbye!

981
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,132
Excuse me.

982
01:21:49,285 --> 01:21:52,787
Don't worry, Walter.
She was adressing her remarks to me.

983
01:22:29,192 --> 01:22:29,918
Hey!

984
01:22:30,431 --> 01:22:31,543
The truck guy's here.

985
01:22:32,288 --> 01:22:35,486
Said something about going bowling?

986
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:42,682
- Okay.

987
01:22:43,756 --> 01:22:44,500
- Okay.

988
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:23,575
- Why didn't you tell me?

989
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,970
- Everybody bites it sooner or later.

990
01:23:26,637 --> 01:23:30,395
I'm just in the AP class, ahead of the game.

991
01:23:31,783 --> 01:23:35,310
- Always the joke.
- Al says it's a phase, it'll stop soon.

992
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:38,488
But, hey! At least it wasn't
about sympathy for the sick kid.

993
01:23:40,272 --> 01:23:41,423
That's not fair!

994
01:23:44,734 --> 01:23:46,294
Is Duke fair?

995
01:23:46,294 --> 01:23:48,259
Is Europe fair?

996
01:23:48,466 --> 01:23:52,270
At this rate I won't even make it
to London, Ontario. Is that fair?

997
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:54,636
Bowling.

998
01:23:56,551 --> 01:23:57,794
That's what I get.

999
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,222
Bowling.

1000
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:18,270
We're not going bowling.

1001
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:19,381
Why?

1002
01:24:20,259 --> 01:24:21,698
We're saving that!

1003
01:24:22,201 --> 01:24:23,290
Turn left.

1004
01:24:53,998 --> 01:24:55,612
So where are we going?

1005
01:24:56,212 --> 01:24:57,357
Sky's the limit!

1006
01:24:57,637 --> 01:24:59,970
I haven't lied to you this far.
I'm not gonna start now.

1007
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,611
What are we doing?

1008
01:25:12,031 --> 01:25:12,991
Really?

1009
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:14,872
- This is the goodbye-scene.

1010
01:25:14,872 --> 01:25:15,872
- Let's not...

1011
01:25:16,438 --> 01:25:17,206
Okay?

1012
01:25:17,206 --> 01:25:19,665
Come on, Zetterstrom!
You can do it!

1013
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,125
Okay.

1014
01:25:26,115 --> 01:25:27,959
Wake up! Natalie!

1015
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,985
Don't you see what happened here?

1016
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:33,511
You had a beautiful life,

1017
01:25:33,985 --> 01:25:35,369
and I had shit.

1018
01:25:36,448 --> 01:25:38,277
I hated your guts.

1019
01:25:38,451 --> 01:25:41,953
I wanted to take you down,
I wanted to make you as miserable as I am

1020
01:25:41,953 --> 01:25:44,850
and that is exactly what I did!

1021
01:25:45,214 --> 01:25:46,211
Now,

1022
01:25:47,419 --> 01:25:48,771
 how's that for a goodbye?

1023
01:25:51,055 --> 01:25:53,621
- Pretty lame.
- Face it, Anderson!

1024
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:55,106
I screwed you!

1025
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,800
I screwed you big time.

1026
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:03,974
So you screwed me.

1027
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:05,662
So what?

1028
01:26:07,404 --> 01:26:08,007
Me?

1029
01:26:09,726 --> 01:26:11,184
I made love to you.

1030
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:17,661
Try again.

1031
01:26:18,436 --> 01:26:19,706
Try again!

1032
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,577
I had it all figured out.
So I cut out early, who cares?

1033
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,058
It's probably a good thing.

1034
01:26:42,058 --> 01:26:44,108
Life sucks, anyway.

1035
01:26:46,275 --> 01:26:47,352
Then I met you

1036
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:48,968
and it got weird.

1037
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:54,622
And you were so..

1038
01:26:55,746 --> 01:26:56,702
..amazing.

1039
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:01,087
- And I...

1040
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,199
What?

1041
01:27:04,573 --> 01:27:05,730
What?

1042
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,543
I just wanted a little more time.

1043
01:27:14,435 --> 01:27:15,642
So all in all,

1044
01:27:16,724 --> 01:27:19,777
I'd say you're the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

1045
01:27:21,431 --> 01:27:22,770
Goodbye partner.

1046
01:27:40,205 --> 01:27:42,359
I am staying with you until you leave.

1047
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:45,549
I don't care how much time we have!

1048
01:27:45,549 --> 01:27:47,660
Get that, you stupid jerk!

1049
01:29:06,122 --> 01:29:07,720
I'm starting her up.

1050
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:19,715
Now turn it to the left.
'til it begins to stall, then back a notch.

1051
01:29:23,379 --> 01:29:24,233
Okay.

1052
01:29:27,259 --> 01:29:30,960
Perfect. Good for another 50,000 miles.

1053
