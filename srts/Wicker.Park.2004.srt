1
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,631
Magnificent, aren't they?

2
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:45,421
God's tears.

3
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:49,341
Yeah.

4
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:51,511
It's beautiful.

5
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,431
So are the others.
I, uh...

6
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,811
I guess I just...
have to make the right decision.

7
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,731
In the end, it's not your eye
that must decide.

8
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,111
Yeah.

9
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,411
Did Rebecca call?

10
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:20,711
Yeah. She'll be at the restaurant
in an hour to take you to the airport.

11
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:24,341
I put your tickets, passport, and
your new cell phone in your briefcase

12
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,051
and Hong will be there
in ten minutes.

13
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,131
Thanks. See you in four days.

14
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,341
The second you land,

15
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:32,641
those guys are gonna start poking
and prodding to see what you're made of.

16
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:34,721
Are you sure I'm the right guy
for this, Walter?

17
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,021
I'm no good at this corporate stuff,
I hate flying--

18
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:39,731
and isn't this Bob's thing, anyway?

19
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,151
Bob? Come on, you're gonna be fine.

20
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,941
Just don't eat anything
that wears a collar,

21
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:46,731
and if you need me, I'll be on the beach
in Cozumel screening my calls.

22
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:50,741
Look...this is a big break for you.

23
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:54,621
But I'm giving you this account because
I think you're the right man for the job.

24
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,041
Besides, you're gonna be a member
of the family soon, right?

25
00:02:58,331 --> 00:02:59,621
Going down, please.

26
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,541
Oh. Matthew, keep away
from the bang-bang girls

27
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,421
or Rebecca will kick my ass, all right?

28
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:21,141
Matty.

29
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,651
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man.

30
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,821
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

31
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,941
Really good. Really good.
Good to see you. You look great.

32
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:31,611
Thanks, man. I mean, I do.

33
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,951
You still doing that whole
advertising thing in New York?

34
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:35,741
I moved back.

35
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,911
- When did you get back?
- Two months ago.

36
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,751
Two months? What are you doing?

37
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,121
You don't call your friend?
You could've called me.

38
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,131
I know. I just--I moved back
with a girl that I met in New York

39
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:47,341
and I'm working for her brother,
and it's...

40
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:49,131
That sounds serious.

41
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,841
Maybe. I don't know.
We'll see.

42
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,221
You look very serious.
Look at you.

43
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,641
I know, man.

44
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:56,851
Hold on!

45
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,021
Listen, man,
I gotta go to a meeting.

46
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,231
Yeah, I need to probably
move my car, too.

47
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:02,811
And then I'm going to China tonight.

48
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,021
- China? That's weird.
- Yeah, I know.

49
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,021
Let me give you a call
when I get back. Monday?

50
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:08,941
Yeah, sounds good--shut up!

51
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:13,031
All right, look, here's my card.
Don't wait two years--call me!

52
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,241
The old shop.

53
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,741
- All right?
- I will, man.

54
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,331
You look good.
That's a nice tie.

55
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,411
Good to see you.

56
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,751
Are you done? Come on!

57
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:32,341
He's very impressed
with what you've done,

58
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:35,931
and he assures you
that when you get to China,

59
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:39,221
you'll be met with much enthusiasm
and support.

60
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,351
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,811
Some champagne, please.
Excuse me.

62
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,741
Excuse you.

63
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,621
Matthew is a, uh, photographer.
Beautifully, wonderfully creative man.

64
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,741
And here's my favorite sister.

65
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,251
His only sister.

66
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,621
Mr. Hong, Ms. Chin,
this is my sister Rebecca.

67
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,721
Hey, Sweetie. How are you?

68
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:15,051
As you can see,

69
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:18,011
Matthew has managed to make himself
indispensable even away from the office.

70
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:26,441
Here, Sweetie. Just take one of these
to help you sleep on the plane.

71
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:29,021
Mr. Hong would like
to propose a toast.

72
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,231
Oh, yes.

73
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:36,741
To a long and prosperous marriage...

74
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,531
of our two companies.

75
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:39,741
Are you okay?

76
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,411
Yeah.

77
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:44,041
Um, excuse me.
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

78
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,251
I'll be right back.

79
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:48,041
Excuse me,
can I have the check, please.

80
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:08,441
Just a minute!

81
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,021
Sorry.

82
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,341
No, you listen!
And I don't feel like calming down.

83
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:38,421
It's over, okay?
That's why I wanted to meet.

84
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,721
No, actually I don't think
it was an accident.

85
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,431
It's in the paper!

86
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,441
I don't ever want
to see you again, Daniel.

87
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,741
Stop following me,
or I'll call the police!

88
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,031
Lisa.

89
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:04,031
Lisa!

90
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,331
Whoa. Hey, come on.

91
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:12,131
Are you all right?

92
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,041
I pissed her off.

93
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,421
You wanna put that
on this card, please?

94
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:59,051
Oh! This stupid...

95
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:00,631
Need some help there, Mare?

96
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:03,551
- What's up?
- It's so frustrating.

97
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:06,221
I just can't work out
why there's no sound.

98
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,721
I just...

99
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:30,411
Matthew? Hello?

100
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,041
Anybody home?

101
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,751
I'll take this one, if you want.

102
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,341
Knock yourself out, kid.

103
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:05,531
Oh, my God.

104
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,451
Shit.

105
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:16,121
- They wanna know how long--hey!
- Mary, I'll be right back.

106
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,541
- Sorry.
- Where are you going?!

107
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:18,751
Oh, sorry!

108
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,941
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lisa.

109
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,741
See you inside.

110
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,341
Hey.

111
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,551
Hey.

112
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,641
- Probably time to go, right?
- Yes.

113
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:37,931
Okay.

114
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:47,151
Pre-boarding call
for flight 752 to Munich.

115
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:50,531
All passengers should board
at this time at gate 5-A

116
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,241
I guess, uh, this is it.

117
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,541
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

118
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,831
No. No, I'm fine.

119
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,541
Okay. Well,
call me when you get there.

120
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:02,121
Okay. I will.

121
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,331
I love you.

122
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,341
Me, too.

123
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:08,921
Bye.

124
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,051
Bye.

125
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,551
Your attention. please.

126
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:19,931
This is the final boarding call
for American Airlines flight 153

127
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,941
service to Shanghai.

128
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,231
All passengers should now
be boarding at gate 1 0-B.

129
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,441
Matthew Simon.
S-l-M-O-N.

130
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:35,741
Shit.

131
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:38,951
Yeah.

132
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,331
Yeah. No, he's not on the plane.

133
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:47,921
He's...

134
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,211
He's sick.

135
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,551
No, he's very sick.
He has food poisoning.

136
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,851
No, he'll be there
in the next couple of days.

137
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:23,621
Lisa?

138
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,341
All right.

139
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,441
Hello?

140
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,631
Lisa?

141
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:03,351
Here. sweetie. Just take one of these
to help you sleep on the plane.

142
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:48,141
That line--what it does to your calf--
that is what we call sexy.

143
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:50,731
Wanna try pink? Hmm?

144
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,731
- Okay.
- Okay. Have a seat.

145
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,151
Hey. There you are.
Where you been?

146
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,441
You look like shit.
I hope she was worth it.

147
00:15:57,531 --> 00:16:00,531
Hey, do we have
a size ten in pink?

148
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,161
Yeah, in the back.

149
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,451
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hey.

150
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,121
- I gotta talk to you.
- Lady Dragon Shoes.

151
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,241
Ow. So, who is she?

152
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:09,541
You wouldn't believe me.

153
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,961
Betcha I do. I probably even know her.
What's her name?

154
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,421
That's the thing.

155
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,421
You don't know her name?
Oh, man.

156
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:20,051
I know that she's a dancer.

157
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,051
You mean, like a stripper?

158
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,931
No, shithead.
Like a real dancer.

159
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,561
Oh, God.
I love a dancer's body. Ooh.

160
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:29,351
But her face is like...

161
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,851
Her eyes...

162
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:35,151
...and her...skin is just...

163
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,941
She just makes me all...

164
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:42,951
What is "wha" and "duh"? She just
makes you more inarticulate than usual.

165
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,031
You are obsessed,
which I don't understand.

166
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:49,121
I mean, I don't know how
you decide on just one.

167
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,121
I mean, my customer over there--
she's got great legs. Ellie.

168
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,041
All right? There is
something hot about Ellie.

169
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,631
The blonde at the window.

170
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,131
I mean, come on.

171
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:03,341
What are you doing?

172
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:07,721
Matty, are you all right?

173
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,141
Lady Dragon Shoes.
Can I help you?

174
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:14,021
The blonde?

175
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:20,941
What are you doing?

176
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:22,151
Give me some shoes.

177
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,451
- Shoes?
- Yeah.

178
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:24,821
Got lots of shoes.

179
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,331
I'm sorry I took so long.
Pink. It's my last pair.

180
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,131
Could I help you with anything?

181
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:41,761
Yes.

182
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,221
Those shoes in the window.

183
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,141
The black ones
with the red sole.

184
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,641
I'd like to try them on, please.

185
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:51,561
The blacks and reds. Okay.

186
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:54,231
I'll just go in the back
and get them for you.

187
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,731
That's where we keep them--
in the back--so...

188
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,021
I'll be right back.

189
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:01,321
Uh, Matty?

190
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:04,821
Maybe you'd like to ask the lady
what size shoe she wears.

191
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,241
- Right.
- 8 1/2.

192
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,161
Like Fellini.

193
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:09,661
Right.

194
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:15,251
I mean his movie, not his shoe size.
I don't know his shoe size, obviously.

195
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,421
8 1/2.

196
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,551
Shit.

197
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:24,921
What was that?

198
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:26,551
Fellini! What the hell
was I thinking?

199
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,221
I have no idea.

200
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,431
But you were right about one thing.
God, she's beautiful.

201
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:34,431
And you, my man,
are an idiot.

202
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:36,941
All right, look.
Here's the thing, all right?

203
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,351
You've obviously blown it,
she obviously hates you,

204
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,521
so you stay right here
and let the man take a shot.

205
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,031
- Shut up. Give me the shoes.
- All right. Go.

206
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:45,941
Just remember--
you're not funny.

207
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:54,241
Here we go.
Black and red.

208
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,731
What do you think?

209
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,031
They're too big.

210
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:29,821
Too big? Really?

211
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:33,161
Luke, these are 9 1/2s.

212
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:36,451
I'm sorry.
That's the smallest size we have.

213
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,041
Oh, well. Too bad.

214
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,331
Not--you know...
not necessarily.

215
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,341
We can order these for you.

216
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:46,131
Special order. And, uh--
I can, uh, if you leave your number,

217
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,421
I can give you a call personally
when they come in.

218
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,551
Do you normally spy on people?

219
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:53,721
What?

220
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,851
Are you really gonna tell me that
you're a huge fan of modern dance?

221
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:08,531
Look, I've never done
anything like that before.

222
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:14,451
Honestly--could you let me take you out
for a cup of coffee and explain?

223
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,121
I don't think so.

224
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:18,451
I'll stay on my side of the table.
I promise.

225
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,621
Just call me
when the shoes come in, okay?

226
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:24,631
Listen, I'm not
what you think I am, okay?

227
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:32,631
Shit.

228
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:47,151
"Tomorrow night. 6:00.
CafР“В© Tangiers on Kinzie.

229
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,231
Now you won't have to follow me. "

230
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:14,261
Well, my parents eventually split up,
and my mom moved back to Prague.

231
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,431
But my dad's still here.
He lives in California.

232
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:21,641
I wish I was in California right now.

233
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:27,021
So, why did you want
to become a photographer?

234
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,651
Fish.

235
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,031
Fish.

236
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:37,951
Tropical fish, actually.

237
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:44,461
When I was a kid, I used to go
to the library and pick out all the books...

238
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:47,041
...with tropical fish, you know.

239
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,841
Beautiful colors and shapes.

240
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:53,551
When I was eight years old, I realized
someone had to take pictures of the fish.

241
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:55,341
And I wanted that to be me.

242
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:59,931
But I grew up and I realized that...

243
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:03,061
things don't have to be extraordinary
to be beautiful.

244
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:05,441
The ordinary
could be just as beautiful.

245
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:08,441
Like what?

246
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:11,021
Well...

247
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,531
Like--you see the couple there?

248
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,531
Look at the way the girl
is holding on to him so tight.

249
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:19,831
But he can still drink his coffee.

250
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:22,741
It looks like she feels safe
wrapped around him.

251
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,341
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another one.

252
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:40,431
Take my picture.

253
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:43,851
I feel beautiful tonight.

254
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:25,431
Bye.

255
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,241
Bye.

256
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,251
Okay.

257
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:32,461
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:33,441
Ma'am?

259
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:36,231
I have your dry cleaning.

260
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,361
Shit.

261
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:16,651
Hey, you're not in China.

262
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:18,441
I didn't make it past O'Hare.

263
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:21,231
- What happened?
- I found Lisa.

264
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:22,941
Whoa.

265
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:31,161
Here it is.

266
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:32,951
This is the article she left behind.

267
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:35,751
The funeral's today.

268
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:37,961
I can't believe you're
blowing off Shanghai for this.

269
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,341
This isn't actually Lisa.
This is a compact.

270
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:42,631
What about your woman?
What's her name, anyway?

271
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:43,841
Rebecca.

272
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:45,551
Yeah, I mean, isn't--
Matt. Matt!

273
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:48,431
Shit.

274
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:51,051
Is it broke?

275
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:53,851
You superstitious?

276
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:55,931
God, I am so stupid.
Here, give it to me--

277
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:58,061
- No, no. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

278
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:00,731
You're right.
This doesn't make any sense.

279
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:03,441
One minute I'm looking at rings,
and the next I'm here, doing this.

280
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:06,361
Whoa.
Whoa, looking at rings?

281
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:08,821
I didn't realize you were that serious.

282
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:10,241
Apparently, I'm not.

283
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:13,831
See, that's how the universe works.

284
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:17,041
The minute you make a decision--
you decide on anything--

285
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:19,331
along comes temptation.

286
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:21,631
What would you do?

287
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:27,131
Keep them both and hope they didn't find
out about each other is what I would do.

288
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:29,431
That's perfect.
Asshole.

289
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,931
I have to find out why she left.

290
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,851
She got scared.
Everyone gets scared.

291
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:42,441
No, not Lisa. She wouldn't have left
without an explanation.

292
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:45,231
Without some sort of letter
or a call or something.

293
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,241
She's not like that.

294
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:49,741
Something must've happened,
and whatever it was--

295
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:52,241
Screwed you up big time.

296
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:58,621
I know she loved me.

297
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:02,131
So let me borrow
your keys, okay?

298
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:04,341
Why?

299
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:07,921
The funeral's today.
It's the only lead I've got.

300
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:09,931
Oh...my car.

301
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:13,051
- Come on.
- Okay. I know. I'm sorry.

302
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,141
You just have to be back by 7:00.

303
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:16,431
I will. Thank you.

304
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,931
I've got a date.

305
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,651
You got a date?

306
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:22,861
Yeah, I got a date.

307
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:24,861
With who?

308
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:28,441
This actress that came into my shop
a couple weeks ago, and, uh...

309
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:32,241
God, I like her a lot,
so please do not be late with my car.

310
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:35,451
I won't be. 6:00.
I'll be back by 6:00, okay?

311
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:45,251
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

312
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:47,841
I have your powder case.
Call me at--"

313
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,761
Excuse me?

314
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:55,761
What can I do for you?

315
00:28:58,061 --> 00:29:00,431
I found a hotel key
in the back yesterday.

316
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:02,561
A woman left it.
I don't know if you saw her.

317
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,521
She fell right over there.
Broke her heel.

318
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:08,651
Yesterday?
Yeah, that's right. I remember.

319
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:10,741
You wanted to leave
the keys with me?

320
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,741
No. Actually, l, uh...

321
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:15,161
could you give her this note
if she comes back in here?

322
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:16,831
- No problem.
- Thanks a lot.

323
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:17,951
Sure.

324
00:30:21,931 --> 00:30:22,931
Lisa!

325
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:25,851
Lisa!

326
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:37,421
"Lisa. I returned your key
as you asked.

327
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:40,931
"You must let me see you
if only for one last time.

328
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,561
"Call me.
My heart can't stand it.

329
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,641
All my love. Daniel. "

330
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,131
Shit.

331
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:31,331
- Ass.
- I'm so sorry.

332
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:33,541
- Hey, I could explain.
- You are an asshole.

333
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,751
Do me a favor--
don't ask me for any more favors.

334
00:33:35,831 --> 00:33:37,461
Come on.
Luke...

335
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:41,471
I found her. I think I found her.
I found her apartment, anyway.

336
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:43,261
I'm really happy for you, Matty.

337
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:46,261
I left a note under her door
to meet me at the park tomorrow.

338
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:48,641
Guess you guys
should have a picnic.

339
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,771
Jesus, man.
I said I was sorry.

340
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:53,231
My entire evening is screwed.

341
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:55,351
Look, I'm not really
that late, brother.

342
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:59,441
Alex doesn't wait for anyone. Trust me.
I've already left three messages.

343
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:01,861
Well, why didn't you take a cab?

344
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:04,661
'Cause I was waiting for you.
I was waiting for my car.

345
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:08,241
Luke, it's not that late.
You can still drive over there.

346
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:11,541
Go over there? And do what?
Throw little pebbles up at her window?

347
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:14,961
She's gone. It's over.
Just forget it.

348
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:18,041
Maybe not.

349
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:26,141
I hope, for our friendship,
this is who I want it to be.

350
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:28,351
Want to see how cool I am?
Three rings.

351
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:32,431
Hello?

352
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:34,441
Hey, how's it goin'?

353
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:37,151
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did you get my messages?

354
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:41,941
No, I lent my car to my buddy Matt,
and he was a little late coming home.

355
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:46,031
No, sure. He's right here.
Hold on a sec.

356
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,451
She wants to talk to you.

357
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:50,831
Fix it.
You have to fix it.

358
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:55,661
Hello?

359
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:58,461
He's full of shit. isn't he?

360
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,541
Yeah, he's full of shit, all right.

361
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,961
Yeah. I knew it.

362
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:07,051
He didn't lend me his car. I took it.

363
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:08,431
I stole his keys.

364
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:10,051
That's good.

365
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:11,561
Why would you do that?

366
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,851
Because I'm a selfish idiot.

367
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:18,941
And I had this whole thing
going on that...

368
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,731
I don't wanna bore you with it.

369
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:22,861
Please. I insist.

370
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:25,531
Okay.

371
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,661
Well, um...

372
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:32,741
I was looking for somebody.
A woman.

373
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,951
I wasn't thinking.

374
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,831
Got a little desperate.

375
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:38,751
Oh. I'm sorry.

376
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:40,041
No.

377
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,041
I should be apologizing to you.

378
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:46,761
And I am apologizing to you.
I'm very sorry that I ruined your evening.

379
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:48,841
Did you find her?

380
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:53,261
I think so. Yeah.
I found where she lives.

381
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,641
Well. you should go back.
and you should look for her.

382
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:57,731
I think I will. Thanks.

383
00:35:57,851 --> 00:35:59,441
You're boring now.
Give me the phone.

384
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:01,231
- Okay, Alex. I gotta go.
- Nice to talk to you.

385
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:03,151
Nice to talk to you, too.
Bye-bye.

386
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:04,941
She's nice, man.

387
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:06,151
Thanks.

388
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,031
Hello?

389
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:16,331
Okay. Why don't I just--
I'll pick you up at the theater.

390
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:35,261
I think not so, my lord.

391
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:37,351
Dear lad, believe it,

392
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:41,941
for they shall yet belie thy happy years
to say thou art a man.

393
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,151
Prosper well in this,

394
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:45,861
and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
to call his fortunes thine.

395
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:48,361
I'll do my best to woo your lady...

396
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,741
...and yet a barful strife.

397
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:53,531
Whoe'er I woo,
myself would be his wife.

398
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,951
Alex, what's going on?

399
00:36:57,951 --> 00:36:59,161
What do you mean?

400
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,751
Well, I'm sitting in the audience
and I'm getting nothing.

401
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:05,541
I figured maybe I'm missing something,
so I come, I take a closer look.

402
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:07,761
But you know what?
I'm still not buying it.

403
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,971
What the hell's
the matter with you today?

404
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:15,051
Look, the line, "Whoe'er I woo,
myself would be his wife"

405
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:16,931
defines your character.

406
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:18,431
You're in love with this guy,

407
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:22,141
and he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

408
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:26,361
You're upset, you're confused,
it's tearing you up inside!

409
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,361
We've gotta see the love,
but we've also gotta see the agony.

410
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,151
You have been in love before,
haven't you?

411
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:36,871
Yes. Sure.

412
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:40,751
Oh, good. Well, please,
share a little something with us, huh?

413
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:46,961
God. you sound so close.
Can't believe you're 7.000 miles away.

414
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,551
I know.
It's crazy, isn't it?

415
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:51,471
How's the weather?

416
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:53,471
I don't know.
It's still dark out.

417
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:55,931
Isn't it. Iike.
10: 00 in the morning there?

418
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:59,061
I--you know what?

419
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:02,941
I'm so zonked, I didn't
even open the blinds yet, and, uh...

420
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:06,441
you know what--it's actually a really
nice day out, now that I see it.

421
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:08,361
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

422
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:11,571
No. I'm just a little out of it,
that's all.

423
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:15,241
Well. you better get in it. because
today's meeting is very important.

424
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:17,951
You'll be fine. honey.
I'll speak to you later. okay?

425
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,951
I miss you.
Bye.

426
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:21,331
Bye.

427
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,741
"Lisa. I found your powder case.

428
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:55,031
"I have to see you.

429
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:58,451
"Meet me tomorrow at 3 : 00.
our usual spot.

430
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:00,451
Matt. "

431
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,071
Hello?

432
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:23,871
Lisa?

433
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:29,141
Fuck.

434
00:42:35,671 --> 00:42:36,961
Lisa?

435
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:49,351
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry. It's okay.

436
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:51,141
I'm calling the police!
Where's the phone?

437
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:53,771
No! Don't call the police!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

438
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,271
- Get away from me!
- Okay! Okay! Calm down!

439
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:58,231
Calm down. It's okay.

440
00:42:58,361 --> 00:42:59,731
I'm a friend of Lisa's.

441
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:01,941
A friend of Lisa's?

442
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,151
Yeah.

443
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:04,861
Is that supposed to be funny?

444
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:08,531
No. You can ask her
when she comes, okay?

445
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:11,541
I'm Lisa.
I live here.

446
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:15,961
Your name's Lisa?

447
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,171
Yeah.

448
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:21,341
And you live here?

449
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:22,761
Yeah.

450
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:26,761
No...

451
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,471
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, wait. Don't.

452
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,771
Hey, you see that letter there?

453
00:43:37,771 --> 00:43:39,941
- You wrote that?
- Yeah.

454
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:42,731
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.

455
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:46,741
Yeah...I was.

456
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:49,451
And you had a room at The Drake,
room 679?

457
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:51,531
Yeah.

458
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:53,951
How'd you know that?

459
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:01,961
I can't believe I did this.

460
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,841
I'm going crazy. Here.

461
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,471
That's yours.

462
00:44:09,761 --> 00:44:10,851
It's broken.

463
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:14,431
I'd be happy to pay for it.
You know, my bad luck.

464
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:16,061
Wait.

465
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:18,561
Your hand.

466
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:20,651
It's bleeding.

467
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:23,571
It's all right.

468
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:25,441
I got this.

469
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:28,861
No, l...
I'll fix it. I'm a nurse.

470
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:33,871
Okay.

471
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:35,661
Thank you.

472
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:40,831
You know, at the restaurant,

473
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:43,341
I would've bet anything
you were this girl I used to know.

474
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:50,761
But now seeing you here, you don't
really look that much like her at all.

475
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:54,141
Must be hallucinating.

476
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:58,351
I was crazy about her.

477
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:08,151
So, what about the, uh...
what's-his-name in the Cadillac?

478
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:11,241
- Daniel.
- Yeah. What's his story?

479
00:45:14,451 --> 00:45:16,451
He's been stalking me.

480
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:19,371
He scares the hell out of me.

481
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:23,751
That's why I was staying in the hotel--
because I didn't want him to find me.

482
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:26,841
I hope he didn't follow you here.

483
00:45:29,051 --> 00:45:30,761
I don't think so. No.

484
00:45:31,971 --> 00:45:33,471
How's your hand?

485
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:35,971
It's okay.

486
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:38,271
I wasn't even hungry or anything.

487
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:40,771
Actually, you know what?

488
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:43,061
Thank you for everything.

489
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,061
For the bandage...

490
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,651
...not calling the cops...

491
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:52,741
...not beating me to death
with the little bronze ballerina, or...

492
00:45:55,371 --> 00:45:56,741
You're leaving?

493
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:58,951
Yeah.

494
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,961
I'm late, you know.

495
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:06,341
Very late, actually, for China, so...

496
00:46:07,461 --> 00:46:09,461
China. That's funny.

497
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:12,261
That's what my friend said, too.

498
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:16,761
Well, maybe you should wait.

499
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,931
I can't. I mean...
I gotta go.

500
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:24,941
Do you really think planes
are still taking off this late?

501
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:32,571
What are you doing?

502
00:46:35,741 --> 00:46:36,951
I'm scared.

503
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:39,241
Of him.

504
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:44,171
I haven't stayed alone here
since his wife died, and...

505
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,041
Would you mind if you stayed?

506
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,261
Lisa, you don't even know me.
I broke into your apartment--

507
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,141
I know. I know. I know.

508
00:46:56,261 --> 00:47:00,061
But--don't take this the wrong way,
but I just think you're a nice guy.

509
00:47:00,141 --> 00:47:01,471
That's all.

510
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:10,441
Okay.

511
00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:13,741
Good.

512
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:15,451
Where does a nice guy sleep?

513
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:18,871
A nice guy
sleeps on the couch.

514
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,241
What are you doing?

515
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:01,951
I'm watching you sleep.

516
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:37,361
Lisa!

517
00:48:47,371 --> 00:48:48,961
Hey, how are you?

518
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:51,331
What are you doing here?

519
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,841
I gotta talk to you.

520
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:55,251
Now?

521
00:48:55,251 --> 00:48:56,961
Yeah, it's kind of important.

522
00:48:57,761 --> 00:49:00,641
Wanna go get a drink or something?
It's freezing out here.

523
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,471
- Okay.
- Okay? Come on.

524
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:09,771
My friend gave my stuff
to this head of the agency, and...

525
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:11,061
he liked it.

526
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:12,441
So...

527
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:14,571
he offered me a job in New York.

528
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,731
That's great.

529
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:21,451
It'll help me pay my rent, but...

530
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:23,371
But what? Why not?

531
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:25,951
Move in with me.

532
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:32,961
I--I know it's only been
a couple of months, but I just, um...

533
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:36,171
You're the reason
I don't wanna move to New York.

534
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:39,551
I wanna make my life
here with you.

535
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:46,851
Look, I'm really late for rehearsal.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

536
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:51,941
Sure.

537
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:55,271
Matthew, trust me, okay?

538
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:57,781
Just meet me tomorrow
in the park. Same time.

539
00:50:00,451 --> 00:50:01,451
Bye.

540
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,651
Have you seen Lisa?

541
00:50:38,651 --> 00:50:39,941
Lisa?

542
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,071
She's gone on a European tour
of Cabaret.

543
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:44,071
It all happened real fast.

544
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:47,241
They came to our rehearsal and
just picked her out, and she was gone.

545
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:53,371
Like...did she say anything
before she left?

546
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,041
Like what?

547
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:57,341
Like, uh...

548
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,341
Cool. Thanks.

549
00:51:02,471 --> 00:51:03,471
Okay.

550
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:50,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

551
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:01,751
You want a cup of coffee?

552
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:03,461
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

553
00:53:24,571 --> 00:53:25,651
No.e

554
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:27,571
No.

555
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,371
No.

556
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:34,371
Yeah.

557
00:53:44,381 --> 00:53:46,051
He broke all my cups.

558
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:49,471
That's original.a

559
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:54,851
Sugar?o

560
00:53:54,971 --> 00:53:56,471
Thanks. Yeah.

561
00:54:03,861 --> 00:54:04,861
Thank you.

562
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:06,651
To us.

563
00:54:31,841 --> 00:54:32,971
Leaving?p

564
00:54:33,551 --> 00:54:35,851
Yeah. I have to go to work.

565
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:38,561
I'm due at the hospital.

566
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:41,271
That's right.
You're a nurse.

567
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:43,061
I got a double shift.

568
00:54:49,861 --> 00:54:51,781
You should stay.u

569
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:57,081
You have a key?t

570
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:58,161
Yeah.b

571
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:01,371
Well, I should be back by 10:00.

572
00:55:03,251 --> 00:55:04,871
Will I see you later?r

573
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:08,381
Maybe.,

574
00:55:09,461 --> 00:55:10,551
Yeah.b

575
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:20,471
- Bye.
- Bye.c

576
00:55:32,781 --> 00:55:34,571
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.i

577
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:38,661
Yeah. I was.

578
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:44,371
Hello?a

579
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:46,751
What happened to you?r

580
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:50,881
Hang on.
Just a minute!

581
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,051
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

582
00:55:54,171 --> 00:55:55,971
- Yeah. Of course.
- Great.

583
00:55:55,971 --> 00:55:58,681
Well, I've gotta call Daniel first,
then I'll be right over.

584
00:55:58,761 --> 00:56:00,051
- Okay.
- Bye.

585
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,441
Lisa!h

586
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:15,361
Oh, shit. Get up.

587
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:25,141
You know.
at the restaurant.o

588
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:27,771
I would've bet anything
you were this girI I used to know.

589
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:32,651
But now seeing you here. You don't
really look that much like her at all.

590
00:58:05,871 --> 00:58:07,281
Hi.-

591
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:34,191
Come on, Lisa.
Let's just talk about this, all right?

592
00:58:35,271 --> 00:58:37,901
Don't start shit like that.
Look, I don't have time...

593
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,691
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

594
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:42,361
Stop acting like a goddamn child
about this crap!

595
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:44,361
Stop screaming at me!

596
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:47,871
Lisa, what are you doing?
Jesus Christ. Be carefuI.

597
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,371
It's over. Get out of my house.

598
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:52,371
Stop! Enough!

599
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:54,291
Get back in here now!h

600
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:56,501
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Don't do it!

601
00:58:56,581 --> 00:58:58,171
Lisa, stop this!

602
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:01,591
Is this how you deal
with your problems?

603
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,971
Huh? You run away
and act like a child?r

604
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:07,091
Go home, and don't bother
calling me, okay?

605
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:08,181
Hi.

606
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:09,761
- Goddamnit!
- Can I come in?

607
00:59:09,891 --> 00:59:11,101
Of course.

608
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:15,391
I'm sorry.
I hate to bother you, but, um,

609
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:19,981
my... ex-boyfriend just told me
he's seeing someone else.

610
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:21,901
I took a chance.
I hope you don't mind.

611
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:23,361
No, not at all.h

612
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:25,491
Lisa, this is stupid, all right?
Come on!

613
00:59:25,571 --> 00:59:27,201
Go home!s

614
00:59:30,491 --> 00:59:32,791
Excuse me, are you leaving?
I'd like to park.

615
00:59:49,181 --> 00:59:50,891
- Hey!
- Hey.p

616
00:59:56,981 --> 00:59:58,981
I'm sorry I didn't call.
l, um...

617
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:01,901
Don't worry.
I've just been thinking.

618
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:04,481
Are you okay?

619
01:00:06,491 --> 01:00:07,991
I'm going to London.

620
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,491
Why?

621
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:12,581
A friend of mine
started his own company.n

622
01:00:12,581 --> 01:00:14,081
He's asked me to choreograph.

623
01:00:14,161 --> 01:00:17,161
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

624
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:18,871
When do you leave?

625
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:20,381
Tomorrow afternoon.g

626
01:00:20,381 --> 01:00:22,381
Is it okay
if I stay another night?

627
01:00:22,381 --> 01:00:23,591
Of course.

628
01:00:23,591 --> 01:00:25,671
No, it has to be tonight.

629
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:28,591
Well, then I'd say
the 10:15 flight to Los Angeles

630
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:30,181
would be your best bet.

631
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:32,391
You can catch the flight
to Shanghai from there.

632
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:35,601
But there's only coach available;
your ticket's for first.

633
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:36,771
It's okay.

634
01:00:38,981 --> 01:00:40,191
I'll tell you what.e

635
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:42,191
I think I can get you an upgrade..

636
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,981
Why don't you come back
in a few hours. Around 4:00.

637
01:00:45,071 --> 01:00:47,491
Something should've
opened up by then.

638
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:48,571
Okay.

639
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:50,991
Thank you.
See you at 4:00.i

640
01:01:11,471 --> 01:01:13,471
The hotel thing was just stupid.

641
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:16,761
I knew Daniel would find me.

642
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:21,191
So...n

643
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:24,771
Why don't you come with me?

644
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:31,701
Well, I've got great shifts
at the hospital now,

645
01:01:31,781 --> 01:01:34,281
and, you know...c

646
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:35,991
And the guy who gave you that.

647
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:38,581
Yeah.e

648
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:43,791
Well, come on. Tell me!.

649
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:49,801
Last night we did it
on the sofa in the doctor's lounge.

650
01:01:49,801 --> 01:01:51,671
You little slut.
I'm jealous!

651
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:54,261
The bad part is
I'm already seeing his best friend.

652
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:56,601
Another surgeon.

653
01:01:57,471 --> 01:02:01,481
He's adorable and he adores me,
but he's the clinging type.

654
01:02:01,771 --> 01:02:06,901
So she had the same name,
same perfume, same shoe size?

655
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:08,981
That's so hot.

656
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:11,781
Or... or maybe this is creepy.

657
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,071
I think it's a little bit of both, actually.b

658
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:16,491
So, did you hit it??

659
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:21,871
No. Um... I slept on the couch,
you know.

660
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:23,791
When I woke up
in the morning, she was gone.

661
01:02:23,871 --> 01:02:25,791
- But you wanted to hit it, didn't you?
- Come on.

662
01:02:25,881 --> 01:02:26,961
Come on.

663
01:02:26,961 --> 01:02:30,671
I'm going to China tonight, I'm practically
engaged... do I need to remind you?

664
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:32,471
The lies we tell ourselves.

665
01:02:34,591 --> 01:02:36,891
So, what about you and Alex...
how's that?

666
01:02:36,971 --> 01:02:38,471
How was your date?7

667
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:42,181
- It was great.
- Good.

668
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:44,271
I mean, what...
you wanna wanna hear about it?

669
01:02:45,191 --> 01:02:46,481
I don't know. Sure.

670
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:52,361
Well. After I left you. I went
to pick up Alex from the theater. Right?

671
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:57,491
She has this director... the guy is
such a cheese ball. Not that impressive.

672
01:02:57,491 --> 01:03:01,581
I mean. She should be on Broadway
or something. 'cause she was awesome.

673
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:04,501
It was super late
by the time she got changed.

674
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:32,281
So we went out.
had a couple drinks and a couple laughs.

675
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:36,071
On the way home. I told her the whole
sordid story about you and Lisa.

676
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:38,281
So now, finally, he's found her.

677
01:03:39,701 --> 01:03:41,371
- Wow.
- Yeah.

678
01:03:43,371 --> 01:03:46,291
And did she explain
why she disappeared?s

679
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:48,291
No, not yet.
He just wrote her this note.

680
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:51,461
They haven't actually spoken,
but they're supposed to speak soon.

681
01:03:58,801 --> 01:03:59,761
You okay?-

682
01:04:03,101 --> 01:04:06,981
No, I'm not. You know, I don't...
I don't feel very well.

683
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:09,691
You're kidding me.

684
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:11,561
No.n

685
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:14,481
Do you mind
just taking me home?

686
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:20,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

687
01:04:20,871 --> 01:04:21,991
Thanks.

688
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:39,091
So, I was thinking,
maybe I could go upstairs with you

689
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:43,261
and I'll make you
a nice big cup of hot chocolate...

690
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:46,771
...put a bunch
of little marshmallows up on top.

691
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:49,191
We'll watch TV and just hang out.

692
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:51,691
Do you love me?

693
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,401
I just wanna be alone.e

694
01:04:57,781 --> 01:04:59,201
- Well...
- I'll call you.

695
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:00,781
I'll call you tomorrow.

696
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:04,081
Alex.
Alex, wait a second.

697
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:05,581
You gotta be kidding me.

698
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,791
This girl's unbelievable.o

699
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:09,501
You know what?
Don't call me, okay?

700
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:12,291
Don't call me until you figure out
what you wanna do with your life,

701
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:13,791
'cause I can't deal with this.

702
01:05:13,881 --> 01:05:16,461
Every time, it's a different story
with you, all right?

703
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:22,181
Wait, l... I'm sorry.

704
01:05:22,971 --> 01:05:24,181
I'll call you tomorrow.

705
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:27,101
God!r

706
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:33,561
This girl is ridiculous.

707
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,171
Taxi!r

708
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:08,181
And we had sex all night.

709
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,891
And the next morning.

710
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:12,891
I made her my dad's
world-famous breakfast, and...

711
01:06:12,981 --> 01:06:14,561
I don't know.
It was pretty perfect.

712
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:18,071
That sounds really good, man.

713
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:19,401
It was pretty good.

714
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:20,781
When do I get to meet her?

715
01:06:22,861 --> 01:06:23,991
Tonight.l

716
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:27,371
Yeah, tonight. Tonight is her...
she's got this play.n

717
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:29,991
It's the big opening.
It's Shakespeare.

718
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:31,791
Shakespeare.

719
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:35,001
Shakespeare. I know.
But it's supposed to be good. Trust me.

720
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:38,881
I'm supposed to leave tonight.l

721
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:40,091
Yeah, but it's early.

722
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:42,091
You can go to the play,
then get on the plane.

723
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:51,271
Have you seen my compact?
You know, the silver one.

724
01:06:51,771 --> 01:06:54,191
No, I haven't.

725
01:06:56,981 --> 01:06:59,191
I hope I didn't leave it
at the hotel.

726
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:02,491
It was a gift from my grandmother.

727
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:11,291
Where did you get this?

728
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:16,501
Um... it's surgeon number two's.

729
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:18,291
He left it here last week.

730
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:21,961
Oh, my God.
It's so much like...

731
01:07:23,381 --> 01:07:24,591
What?s

732
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:28,971
Matthew.h

733
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:43,781
So you're not getting
into too much trouble?

734
01:07:45,201 --> 01:07:46,281
Thanks.w

735
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:47,991
Take care of yourself, okay?

736
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:39,501
- Come on, let me film you.
- No. You first.

737
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:43,801
Come on, Alex. Are you shy? You can't
be shy if you wanna be an actress.

738
01:08:43,801 --> 01:08:44,881
Here.h

739
01:08:45,011 --> 01:08:47,671
- Shakespeare?
- This is your big break.

740
01:08:47,801 --> 01:08:50,301
That's Shakespeare.
I can't do that. That's too hard.

741
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:52,801
Haply, when I shall wed.

742
01:08:52,891 --> 01:08:55,391
that lord whose hand
must take my plightw

743
01:08:55,471 --> 01:08:59,771
shall carry half my love with him,
half my care and duty.

744
01:08:59,891 --> 01:09:04,481
Surely I shall never marry
like my sisters to love my father all.

745
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:09,991
So true, my lord.
In life... oh! I blew it.

746
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:11,701
I'm sorry. That was bad.

747
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:15,291
No, that was amazing.

748
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:18,371
You know, the thing with acting, Alex,
is you just have to commit.

749
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:20,171
Otherwise, you're just a phony.

750
01:09:25,001 --> 01:09:26,171
I can't hear anything.k

751
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:27,461
I know.

752
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:29,971
That's weird.o

753
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:36,681
- Is it hooked up right?
- Yeah.

754
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:38,481
Can you take it back?g

755
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:42,101
I know a place
I can get it fixed, actually.

756
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:48,401
Do you believe
in love at first sight?.

757
01:09:48,491 --> 01:09:49,691
Well, who is he?.

758
01:09:51,781 --> 01:09:53,571
Don't even try to lie about it.

759
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:57,371
I haven't met him yet.
I've just seen him.

760
01:09:57,491 --> 01:10:00,211
I don't think he's got a girlfriend.
I can tell.

761
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,291
Don't wait.
The good ones go fast.

762
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:06,381
Well, I gotta go get the video camera,
so I'll talk to you later.

763
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:07,591
All right..

764
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:10,591
Hey... promise you'll talk to him?

765
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:13,891
Yeah... I'll think about it.

766
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,471
Okay. Bye.n

767
01:10:57,301 --> 01:10:58,311
I'll be right back.

768
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:00,391
- Sorry.
- Matthew, where are you going?r

769
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:01,771
Sorry.a

770
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:32,881
My God.
it's so much like... Matthew.

771
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:35,681
Don't be silly.

772
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:38,181
It belongs to one of the doctors
at the hospital.

773
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:42,271
Why would you think of Matthew?e

774
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:51,481
Could I borrow
your car again tonight?o

775
01:11:51,571 --> 01:11:52,571
Oh, sure.

776
01:11:54,401 --> 01:11:55,571
Thanks, Lisa.h

777
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:59,701
Well, I better go.
I'll see you later.

778
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:00,871
Okay.w

779
01:12:05,711 --> 01:12:07,671
Hi, excuse me?
I was in here a couple of days ago.

780
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:11,381
I think I might have left a compact.
It's silver, engraved.

781
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:12,881
Um, let me ask.w

782
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:16,171
Tony, did anyone turn in
a silver compact?

783
01:12:16,301 --> 01:12:17,681
No. Sorry.e

784
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:19,471
Okay. Thank you.i

785
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:20,601
Lisa?a

786
01:12:22,311 --> 01:12:23,601
Yeah?

787
01:12:23,681 --> 01:12:27,391
A guy did come in here looking for you.
Said he found your keys. Oh! And...

788
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:31,691
He left you this.

789
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:33,071
- Thank you.
- Sure.o

790
01:12:37,071 --> 01:12:39,701
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

791
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:41,581
"I have your powder case.

792
01:12:41,581 --> 01:12:43,201
"Call me.s

793
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:44,371
Matthew. "e

794
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:37,091
Hey, Luke, can I talk to you
for a second?

795
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:40,381
Hey, Ellie, do me a favor.
Will you help her out?

796
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:41,591
Yeah, sure.j

797
01:13:41,681 --> 01:13:42,891
How's it goin'?

798
01:13:42,971 --> 01:13:45,391
Hey. I just wanna say thanks
for everything

799
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:47,601
and, you know,
you've been great.

800
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:49,981
What about the play?
I thought you were comin' to the play.

801
01:13:51,271 --> 01:13:53,981
I don't wanna miss
another flight, you know.

802
01:13:54,111 --> 01:13:56,781
Listen, I'll make it up to you
when I get back. I promise.

803
01:13:58,071 --> 01:13:59,191
Hey, taxi!t

804
01:13:59,991 --> 01:14:03,281
You have fun tonight, though, all right?
Say hi to Alex for me, and, you know.

805
01:14:03,411 --> 01:14:05,281
- You're a lucky guy.
- You got plenty of time.

806
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:08,701
It's the late flight. I really want you
to come to the play. Please?

807
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:11,871
See, things, um... it's just not going
that well with Alex.

808
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:14,171
I've been kind of
exaggerating a little.

809
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:16,171
What do you mean?

810
01:14:16,171 --> 01:14:17,381
Well...

811
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:19,801
Lying.
Uh! I've been lying!

812
01:14:19,881 --> 01:14:21,511
It's 'cause my life's so pathetic.

813
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:22,881
No all-night marathon?

814
01:14:22,971 --> 01:14:25,391
God, I'm lucky if I get a kiss
at the end of the night.

815
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:29,101
So I was thinking that if you came
to the play, I think that would really help.

816
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:31,771
I mean, I'd be so much
more confident with you there.

817
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:34,901
And then I can go to the bathroom
and you can tell her,

818
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:36,611
you know,
what a great guy I am

819
01:14:36,691 --> 01:14:39,571
and rumor has it I'm really good
in the sack, and that, um...

820
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:42,071
I'm hung like a camel...
I don't know.i

821
01:14:43,781 --> 01:14:46,411
Please? I wouldn't ask
if it didn't mean a lot to me.

822
01:14:46,491 --> 01:14:49,491
- I'll be there.
- Oh, you're the best. Thanks, buddy.

823
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:51,291
7:30, all right?

824
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:53,581
- I got it.
- Good. There you go.

825
01:14:53,581 --> 01:14:55,291
- See you, brother.
- Yeah.

826
01:14:57,091 --> 01:14:58,381
You the man. Thanks, man.

827
01:14:58,501 --> 01:15:02,381
Well, you're all set.
You're on flight 1559. First class.

828
01:15:03,301 --> 01:15:04,381
Have a good trip.i

829
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:06,801
I will. Thanks a lot..

830
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:29,991
Um, I'm booked in a flight
to London today.

831
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:32,581
I'd like to postpone it
until tomorrow, please.n

832
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:39,171
Those shoes.
The black ones with the red sole.

833
01:15:39,171 --> 01:15:41,091
I'd like to try them on. Please.

834
01:16:06,201 --> 01:16:10,781
Oh, excuse me, dear. Could you tell me
how to get to this museum from here?

835
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:15,001
I think it's...e

836
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,291
I think it's back here.o

837
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:23,381
- Let me show you. I'll walk you.
- Oh, thank you.

838
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,491
Alex, ten minutes!

839
01:16:55,201 --> 01:16:57,081
This is it right up here.i

840
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:01,381
- Here. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

841
01:17:02,381 --> 01:17:03,501
Thanks.w

842
01:17:10,471 --> 01:17:14,181
How much better that man should fall
before the lion than the wolf.

843
01:17:15,101 --> 01:17:17,891
The clock upbraids me
with the waste of time.o

844
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:22,691
Be not afraid, good youth.
I will not have you.

845
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,781
And yet when wit and youth
is come to harvest,

846
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:27,401
your wife is like
to reap a proper man.

847
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:28,571
I'm right here. Sorry.

848
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:30,201
There lies your way.
Due west.

849
01:17:30,281 --> 01:17:31,281
Excuse me.

Then westward ho. Grace and
good disposition attend your ladyship.

I prithee, tell me
what thou thinkst of me.

854
01:17:46,301 --> 01:17:48,801
That you do... think...

855
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:57,471
Sit down.

856
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:58,891
- You are...
- Sorry.

857
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,901
Not what you are.

858
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,481
Is that her?

859
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:06,111
Yeah, that's my girl.

860
01:18:08,611 --> 01:18:10,201
Then think you right.o

861
01:18:11,071 --> 01:18:12,571
I am not what I am.s

862

I would you were
as I would have you be.

863
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:18,871
Would it be better,
madam, than I am?

864
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:22,211
I wish it might,
for now I am your fool.

865
01:18:29,011 --> 01:18:30,301
You're in love with this guy.

866
01:18:30,381 --> 01:18:32,881
and he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

867
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:36,311
You're upset. You're confused.
it's tearing you up inside!

868
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,601
You have been in love before.
haven't you?

869
01:18:48,611 --> 01:18:51,491
By my innocence, I swear,
and by my youth,

870
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:54,991
I have one heart,
one bosom, and one truth.

871
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:58,081
And no woman has,
nor never none shall,

872
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,791
mistress be of it
to save I alone.

873
01:19:01,501 --> 01:19:04,211
And so adieu, good madam.c

874
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:07,211
Nevermore will I my master's tears
to you deplore.

875
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:12,171
She's good.

876
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:26,981
Look, I should really get
to the airport.

877
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:29,191
Yeah. Yeah.
If you have to go, go.

878
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:33,201
I'm sure Alex is gonna be disappointed
she didn't get a chance to meet you.

879
01:19:33,281 --> 01:19:35,491
Tell her she did a great job.
And I'll see you on Monday.

880
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:38,491
I will. Hey, Matt, thanks for everything.
It means a lot to me.

881
01:19:39,281 --> 01:19:40,991
I'm sorry you didn't find Lisa.

882
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:43,001
Yeah, me, too.

883
01:19:45,001 --> 01:19:47,211
- I'll see you around, huh?
- All right, man.

884
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:14,701
Hey, Alex..

885
01:20:14,781 --> 01:20:16,281
Alex, it's me.

886
01:20:17,201 --> 01:20:18,701
Please go away.

887
01:20:19,701 --> 01:20:21,201
C'mon, baby. Open the door.u

888
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:24,081
I don't want your friend
to see me like this.

889
01:20:24,201 --> 01:20:26,501
He won't. He left.t

890
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:32,171
What? He left?
Did I scare him away?

891
01:20:32,171 --> 01:20:34,011
Scare him away?
You blew him away.

892
01:20:34,091 --> 01:20:37,681
You blew everyone away.
You were unbelievable.

893
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:39,181
He just had a plane to catch.

894
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,181
A slow one to China.
Open the door.r

895
01:20:43,101 --> 01:20:44,471
Did he find her?c

896
01:20:45,391 --> 01:20:46,481
What?i

897
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:49,401
Your friend... did...n

898
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:52,771
Did he find Lisa?T

899
01:20:55,111 --> 01:21:00,071
No, it just turned out to be some... psycho
with the same name, same everything.

900
01:21:00,071 --> 01:21:03,081
He slept on her couch and ran away
as fast as he could.

901
01:21:04,581 --> 01:21:05,791
Are you okay?p

902
01:21:08,871 --> 01:21:10,711
Alex. You've gotta help me..

903
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:13,591
What's wrong?

904
01:21:13,671 --> 01:21:16,801
Well, I booked this job...
a European tour of Cabaret.

905
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:18,301
Oh, wow! That's fantastic!a

906
01:21:18,381 --> 01:21:21,091
I know. Some girl broke her ankle,
I'm taking over.m

907
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:22,891
But listen, I can't find Matthew.

908
01:21:22,971 --> 01:21:27,101
I've been looking all over for him,
and my plane's leaving in two hours.

909
01:21:27,181 --> 01:21:29,191
Did you leave him a message?

910
01:21:29,311 --> 01:21:31,771
I can't really leave this
on his machine, you know.

911
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:33,611
It's too complicated.

912
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:36,491
I wrote him a letter.
Do you mind giving it to him?

913
01:21:38,201 --> 01:21:41,071
I've never even met him.
He doesn't knowwho I am.

914
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:44,491
It doesn't matter... just tell him
you're my friend. It'll be fine.

915
01:21:44,581 --> 01:21:47,001
You know what,
and if he's not there...

916
01:21:47,081 --> 01:21:50,211
just let yourself in
and leave it on his bed.

917
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:55,001
I really appreciate this.
Thank you so much.

918
01:21:55,091 --> 01:21:57,011
Sure. Okay.d

919
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:58,091
All right.h

920
01:22:02,181 --> 01:22:04,011
He asked me
to move in with him.

921
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:08,391
Oh. What did you say?

922
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:09,981
I didn't really say anything.

923
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:13,191
I was late for a class,
and I just sort of ran away.

924
01:22:14,111 --> 01:22:17,481
I said I'd meet him tomorrow.
If I don't show up, you know, he'll go nuts.

925
01:22:17,611 --> 01:22:19,111
Anyway, I have to go.

926
01:22:19,191 --> 01:22:22,071
Thanks again, and I'll call you
when I get there, okay?

927
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:24,201
Are you gonna do it?

928
01:22:25,281 --> 01:22:27,491
Of course.
I love him.

929
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:30,581
Bye.o

930
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:31,871
Bye.z

931
01:23:04,991 --> 01:23:08,081

Please leave a message.

932
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:12,001
Hey. It's me again.e

933
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:14,291
Where are you?

934
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:16,381
Did you get my letter?

935
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:18,211
Anyway. I'm in Paris.h

936
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:21,301

the number in my last message.

937
01:23:21,381 --> 01:23:23,681
Matt. Please call me.e

938
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:26,601
This is driving me crazy.
I need to speak to you.

939
01:23:27,681 --> 01:23:30,811
Look. If you're angry at me.
then don 't be.

940
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:34,391
Just call... please.
Bye.

941
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:17,311
I don 't know
if I can stay with the show.e

942
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:19,481
I feel like I have to come home
and look for him.

943
01:24:20,611 --> 01:24:21,901
No, I...,

944
01:24:23,991 --> 01:24:26,281
I wasn't gonna say
anything before, but...r

945
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:29,911
...when I brought him the letter...

946
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:33,081
...he wasn't expecting me, and...

947
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:38,711
...I found him in bed
with another woman, Lisa.

948
01:24:43,091 --> 01:24:44,591
l... I can't believe it.

949
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:48,591
Just... forget about him.i

950
01:24:48,591 --> 01:24:51,681
The best thing for you to do
is stay with the show and...

951
01:24:51,811 --> 01:24:53,181
just forget him.

952
01:24:57,601 --> 01:24:59,981
I really thought I knew him.'

953
01:25:00,111 --> 01:25:02,481
Just forget him.
He's not even worth it.t

954
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,871
Luke, I'm so sorry.o

955
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:21,711
No. Shh... it's okay.y

956
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:23,501
I'm so sorry.I

957
01:25:23,591 --> 01:25:26,511
No. Please, don't apologize.
Please. God.

958
01:25:29,391 --> 01:25:31,181
I know you're doing the best you can.

959
01:25:32,181 --> 01:25:33,181
I just...

960
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:40,981
I just want you to know that I...
that I love you.

961
01:25:44,271 --> 01:25:46,691
All right? And I don't
wanna play games anymore..

962
01:25:46,691 --> 01:25:49,281
What's the point?
I'm just terrible at them anyway.

963
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:47,591
Do me a favor.
Grab that, would you?

964
01:26:51,091 --> 01:26:52,181
Hello?e

965
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:54,601

966
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:57,101
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

967
01:26:57,101 --> 01:26:59,101
This is Matthew.
Who is this?

968
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:02,391
Hello?s

969
01:27:02,981 --> 01:27:04,101
Hello?0

970
01:27:04,191 --> 01:27:07,191
Hey, what's up, kid?
I thought you left.

971
01:27:07,981 --> 01:27:09,491
No, uh...'

972
01:27:10,781 --> 01:27:12,401
What are you still doing here?e

973
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:14,491
I'm over at the...

974
01:27:14,491 --> 01:27:15,781
girl's apartment.i

975
01:27:16,701 --> 01:27:19,201
You went back
to the crazy girl's house?i

976
01:27:20,081 --> 01:27:21,791
What the hell are you doing there?r

977
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:27,091
I'm really starting
to worry about you, man.

978
01:27:28,501 --> 01:27:30,301
I'm starting to worry myself.

979
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:33,511
It's not just that..

980
01:27:34,091 --> 01:27:36,181
I couldn't even
get on the airplane.

981
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:40,601
The thing is....

982
01:27:42,181 --> 01:27:43,981
...there's something
about this apartment.

983
01:27:49,781 --> 01:27:51,691
It's like Lisa's been here.

984
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:56,201
I know this sounds insane. But...

985
01:27:56,281 --> 01:27:58,491
I think this is her place. Man.

986
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:04,211
Well. Maybe you're
just hot for this crazy girI.

987
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:07,581
First thing you gotta do is get out
of her apartment and get over here.

988
01:28:07,711 --> 01:28:09,501
I'll tell you about some stuff. Too.

989
01:28:09,591 --> 01:28:13,591
I've had the most amazing night
of my entire life last night.

990
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:16,891
Okay. I'll be over. Just give me
a couple of minutes. Okay?

991
01:28:17,011 --> 01:28:19,311
All right. I'll wait.
Later.

992
01:28:26,311 --> 01:28:28,191
- Hello?
- Hi. Um...

993
01:28:28,311 --> 01:28:30,821
May I speak to Matthew, please?

994
01:28:32,901 --> 01:28:34,191
Who is this?

995
01:28:34,281 --> 01:28:36,701
Um... this is Lisa.

996
01:28:36,781 --> 01:28:40,081
I'm a friend of his.
I'm calling about my compact.

997
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:41,791
I think he might have found it.

998
01:28:41,911 --> 01:28:43,791
Uh... which Lisa is this?

999
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:45,211
Pardon me?

1000
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:49,001
Uh... I'll tell you what...

1001
01:28:49,081 --> 01:28:53,381
he's actually supposed to be here
in a couple of minutes.

1002
01:29:01,181 --> 01:29:02,311
Hello?

1003
01:29:02,511 --> 01:29:03,521
Hello!c

1004
01:29:04,521 --> 01:29:05,601
Hi.a

1005
01:29:05,811 --> 01:29:06,811
Hi.t

1006
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:10,191
I'm sorry I didn't come back.
My, um...

1007
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:15,281
...double shift turned into a triple,
and I just couldn't get away.

1008
01:29:15,401 --> 01:29:17,201
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

1009
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:19,281
Are you mad?

1010
01:29:20,411 --> 01:29:22,701
No. Not at all.
I had a great time.

1011
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,791
Where are you?.

1012
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:28,211
Well, I'm still at work but, um,
I'm just leaving now,

1013
01:29:28,211 --> 01:29:29,581
so why don't you wait?

1014
01:29:30,881 --> 01:29:32,091
Yeah, I'll wait.

1015
01:29:32,211 --> 01:29:34,511
Okay. Great.
I'll see you soon.d

1016
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:41,801
Let me. Uh...
let me grab your phone number

1017
01:29:41,891 --> 01:29:45,311
and I will have him call you
when he gets in.

1018
01:29:45,391 --> 01:29:50,981
Um, you know... actually, could you
just tell him to meet me at 3:00?

1019
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:53,901
He'd know where.
Um, I'll be waiting for him.

1020
01:29:53,981 --> 01:29:56,281
3:00. Okay.

1021
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:59,611
l... you know what,
it can't be him already,

1022
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:01,201
but I'm expecting him.

1023
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:03,781
Someone's at my front door.
so maybe it is him.

1024
01:30:03,911 --> 01:30:05,201
So hold on a second.

1025
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:14,301
Matthew, trust me, okay?i

1026
01:30:15,801 --> 01:30:17,801
Meet me tomorrow in the park.
Same time.m

1027
01:30:21,011 --> 01:30:22,091
Bye.a

1028
01:30:30,811 --> 01:30:33,111
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It wasn't him. It was someone else.

1029
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:37,481
But I promise you
I will give him your message. Okay?

1030
01:30:37,481 --> 01:30:39,191
Oh. Okay. Thank you.o

1031
01:30:45,201 --> 01:30:47,291
I went to get cigarettes.
What's going on?

1032
01:30:48,701 --> 01:30:51,211
Matthew. He didn't leave.

1033
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:54,081
He went back to that girl's house.
The crazy one.

1034
01:30:54,211 --> 01:30:56,091
Oh, the plot thickens.

1035
01:30:56,211 --> 01:30:58,301
Oh, yeah. It gets even better.
Listen to this.

1036
01:30:58,381 --> 01:31:02,221
So I hang up the phone,
and five seconds later, Lisa called.

1037
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:06,891
The real Lisa.
The one from two years ago.

1038
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:08,311
She wants to see him.

1039
01:31:10,891 --> 01:31:12,101
You tell him?

1040
01:31:12,191 --> 01:31:15,111
No, not yet.
I'll wait till he gets here.

1041
01:31:15,191 --> 01:31:18,191
He's gonna be so happy,
he's gonna hit the moon again.

1042
01:31:18,321 --> 01:31:19,491
I have to go!.

1043
01:31:20,111 --> 01:31:22,281
- What do you mean?
- I'll call you later. I promise..

1044
01:31:22,281 --> 01:31:24,701
But I made breakfast.
My dad's famous potatoes.

1045
01:31:32,081 --> 01:31:34,501
Lisa called.
She wants to see him.

1046
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:39,001
So, will you let me
meet your friends?

1047
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:40,711
Don't you have a store to run?

1048
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,381
Oh, okay.
I can take a hint.

1049
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:44,091
So we're going out tomorrow, right?

1050
01:31:44,091 --> 01:31:46,101
- 7:00?
- Sure.

1051
01:31:46,181 --> 01:31:47,181
Okay..

1052
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:49,521
Bye, and thanks for the lift.i

1053
01:31:49,521 --> 01:31:50,601
Bye.n

1054
01:31:53,311 --> 01:31:54,901
Matty. Hey.
Matty!

1055
01:31:55,981 --> 01:31:58,401
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man!

1056
01:31:58,481 --> 01:32:00,691
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

1057
01:32:00,821 --> 01:32:01,991
Really good. Really good.

1058
01:32:08,991 --> 01:32:12,291
Oh, excuse me. Could I order
an espresso while I wait for my friend?

1059
01:32:12,411 --> 01:32:13,411
Absolutely.

1060
01:32:20,211 --> 01:32:23,091
He's very impressed
with what you've done.o

1061
01:32:23,221 --> 01:32:26,801
and he assures you that
when you get to China...

1062
01:32:27,801 --> 01:32:30,101
...with much enthusiasm
and support.

1063
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:32,891
I'm sitting over here.

1064
01:32:34,811 --> 01:32:35,811
Excuse me. Champagne.

1065
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:44,491
Excuse you.h

1066
01:32:47,111 --> 01:32:48,121
No.i

1067
01:32:50,201 --> 01:32:52,291
Uh, Miss Chin,
this is my sister Rebecca.

1068
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,791
Shit, shit, shit!

1069
01:32:56,791 --> 01:32:59,001
As you can see, uh...

1070
01:33:02,211 --> 01:33:03,511
Here, Sweetie...

1071
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:15,521
Hello. Bellucci's.
May I help you?

1072
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:17,601
Hello, may I speak
to my friend Lisa, please?

1073
01:33:17,601 --> 01:33:20,481
She's the blonde.
She's sitting at a table behind the bar.

1074
01:33:22,111 --> 01:33:23,191
Yes. Just a minute. Please.s

1075
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:26,111
Excuse me. Are you Lisa?

1076
01:33:26,781 --> 01:33:27,911
Phone's for you.t

1077
01:33:27,991 --> 01:33:30,911
It's a little noisy here. Why don't you
take the house phone around the corner.

1078
01:33:30,991 --> 01:33:32,201
Okay. Thank you.

1079
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:37,211
T o a long and prosperous marriage...
of our two companies.

1080
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:40,791
Excuse me. I'm gonna go make
a phone call. I'll be right back.

1081
01:33:40,921 --> 01:33:41,921
No.a

1082
01:33:44,211 --> 01:33:45,301
No.o

1083
01:33:45,381 --> 01:33:47,881
- Hello?
- Hey, Lisa. It's me.

1084
01:33:48,011 --> 01:33:49,301
Hey. What happened to you?m

1085
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:51,511
I know. I'm so sorry.
I got stuck at work.

1086
01:33:51,601 --> 01:33:54,101
Look. Daniel's found me
at the hotel.

1087
01:33:54,101 --> 01:33:55,891
Hang on.
Just a minute!

1088
01:33:57,891 --> 01:34:00,601
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

1089
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:02,481
Yeah, of course. Um...

1090
01:34:03,401 --> 01:34:05,821
Go there right now.
I'll... I'll meet you there.

1091
01:34:23,421 --> 01:34:24,501
Hey.

1092
01:34:24,591 --> 01:34:25,711
Hey.s

1093
01:34:29,011 --> 01:34:30,091
How are you, Lisa?

1094
01:34:30,221 --> 01:34:32,801
Good. How are you?

1095
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:33,891
Good.e

1096
01:34:35,681 --> 01:34:37,391
Thought you'd be in China by now.e

1097
01:34:38,181 --> 01:34:40,191
That makes two of us.
Sit down.?

1098
01:34:43,691 --> 01:34:45,901
- What's that?
- It's a present.

1099
01:34:45,981 --> 01:34:47,611
- For me?
- Yeah.

1100
01:34:49,491 --> 01:34:52,911
I saw that yours were...
yours were broken, so...

1101
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:55,791
Uh, wanna try them on?

1102
01:34:59,211 --> 01:35:01,211
That's very sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1103
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:02,581
Oh, that's okay.

1104
01:35:10,511 --> 01:35:11,721
They're a little big.

1105
01:35:14,801 --> 01:35:16,811
What size shoe do you wear?

1106
01:35:21,101 --> 01:35:22,101
Seven.

1107
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:25,611
These are 8 1/2.

1108
01:35:33,411 --> 01:35:37,411
I would've told you what size I was if I
knew you were gonna get me some shoes.

1109
01:35:38,491 --> 01:35:40,201
It's okay.
I could exchange them.

1110
01:35:45,081 --> 01:35:46,711
You don't have to do that. I...

1111
01:35:47,501 --> 01:35:50,721
Anyway, I told a friend of mine I'd
meet him for coffee before I left, so...

1112
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:53,801
What? You're leaving?

1113
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:56,101
Yeah.

1114
01:35:58,391 --> 01:35:59,521
Bye.

1115
01:36:17,911 --> 01:36:20,411
Hey, Luke. It's me.
Let's meet.

1116
01:36:50,111 --> 01:36:51,401
Jesus Christ.

1117
01:36:51,481 --> 01:36:53,491
What are you doin'?
I thought you were comin' by.

1118
01:36:53,491 --> 01:36:56,781
l, uh... I was comin' by.
I just lost track of the time.

1119
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:59,621
I got good news for you.
Let's go have a drink.

1120
01:36:59,621 --> 01:37:01,491
I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

1121
01:37:03,701 --> 01:37:04,711
Come on.

1122
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:13,801
Hey, babe. I came as soon as you called.
Look who I ran into. It's Matthew.

1123
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:15,881
Matthew, Alex.
Alex, Matthew.

1124
01:37:16,011 --> 01:37:18,011
Finally you two meet.

1125
01:37:27,401 --> 01:37:28,601
Hi.

1126
01:37:29,611 --> 01:37:30,691
Hello.

1127
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:32,901
Have a seat.

1128
01:37:38,991 --> 01:37:40,201
Hi.

1129
01:37:40,201 --> 01:37:41,701
Hello.

1130
01:37:41,781 --> 01:37:42,911
Want a cocktail?

1131
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:45,001
Excuse me.

1132
01:37:46,711 --> 01:37:48,001
Hi, how can I help you?

1133
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:49,211
What do you want?

1134
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:52,211
A vodka rocks. Double.

1135
01:37:52,921 --> 01:37:54,011
Wow.

1136
01:37:54,091 --> 01:37:55,211
Baby?

1137
01:37:56,301 --> 01:37:58,881
You know what? I'll have, um,
I'll have a Seven and Seven.

1138
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:01,801
Put it in a bucket. Not like a double,
but more like a one and a half.

1139
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:04,101
He knows how to do it.
Thanks.

1140
01:38:04,101 --> 01:38:05,181
You got it.

1141
01:38:05,181 --> 01:38:07,021
So what happened
with your psycho?

1142
01:38:10,101 --> 01:38:13,191
You can say it in front of Alex.
She knows the whole story anyway.

1143
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:19,781
Sometimes when you see
someone from afar...

1144
01:38:21,491 --> 01:38:23,201
...you develop a fantasy.

1145
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:27,711
Then when you see them up close,

1146
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:30,081
nine times out of ten,
you wish you hadn't.

1147
01:38:34,301 --> 01:38:37,881
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1148
01:38:41,221 --> 01:38:44,601
I was confused,
so I went back to her apartment, and...

1149
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:51,691
...thought I'd find what I was looking for,
but I found something else.

1150
01:38:53,481 --> 01:38:54,691
Did you talk to her?

1151
01:38:55,821 --> 01:38:58,691
Just long enough for her
to convince me that she's a liar.

1152
01:38:59,991 --> 01:39:01,611
No harm, no foul, though, right?

1153
01:39:03,911 --> 01:39:06,911
What do you think, Alex?
I mean, you know the whole story.

1154
01:39:09,501 --> 01:39:11,581
It's easy to stand back and judge.

1155
01:39:11,711 --> 01:39:14,421
You don't know anything
about this woman.

1156
01:39:15,211 --> 01:39:19,091
I know that she has no conscience
and no regard for anyone but herself.

1157
01:39:19,221 --> 01:39:20,721
I mean, what else
do I need to know?

1158
01:39:20,801 --> 01:39:23,221
You make yourself
into such a victim.

1159
01:39:23,301 --> 01:39:26,391
Nobody made you be with her. You can't
even see what a hypocrite you're being.

1160
01:39:26,511 --> 01:39:28,181
I'm being a hypocrite?
How am I being a hypocrite?

1161
01:39:28,181 --> 01:39:30,101
- Yes, you are!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1162
01:39:30,181 --> 01:39:31,521
You guys. Hey, relax.

1163
01:39:31,601 --> 01:39:32,901
No, Luke. Hey, hold on.

1164
01:39:33,021 --> 01:39:35,901
Alex, I'd like you to explain to me
how I'm being a hypocrite.

1165
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:44,991
Who's to say this woman hasn't been
in love with you for a really long time?

1166
01:39:45,121 --> 01:39:49,621
And now that she found you again,
she wasn't about to let you go twice.

1167
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:53,501
What?

1168
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:54,711
Maybe...

1169
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:56,591
the first time she saw you,

1170
01:39:56,711 --> 01:39:59,921
maybe she felt the way you did
the first time you saw Lisa.

1171
01:40:01,301 --> 01:40:02,591
You remember that.

1172
01:40:04,221 --> 01:40:06,601
Love makes you do crazy things.

1173
01:40:07,511 --> 01:40:08,891
Insane things.

1174
01:40:10,101 --> 01:40:13,101
Things in a million years
you never thought you'd see yourself do.

1175
01:40:15,521 --> 01:40:18,111
There you are doin' it.
Can't help it.

1176
01:40:19,111 --> 01:40:22,191
Jesus Christ.
Lighten up, you guys.

1177
01:40:22,321 --> 01:40:25,491
This woman... she's a nut.
She's psycho.

1178
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:28,491
She's cuckoo-bananas, all right?
End of story.

1179
01:40:28,621 --> 01:40:30,701
Can we change the subject?

1180
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:32,791
I actually have something
to cheer you up.

1181
01:40:32,911 --> 01:40:36,921
Did you, uh, leave a note
with the bartender here a few days ago?

1182
01:40:37,791 --> 01:40:39,591
Yeah, I did.
How do you know that?

1183
01:40:39,591 --> 01:40:41,011
'Cause Lisa called.

1184
01:40:41,591 --> 01:40:42,801
What?

1185
01:40:42,881 --> 01:40:47,721
Yeah! After you got off the phone.
She said to meet her at 3:00.

1186
01:40:47,801 --> 01:40:51,391
She couldn't wait long, 'cause she had
to get on a plane to London.

1187
01:40:52,811 --> 01:40:55,021
W-where am I
supposed to meet her?

1188
01:40:55,101 --> 01:40:57,101
She didn't say.
She said you'd know.

1189
01:40:57,901 --> 01:40:59,401
You don't know?

1190
01:41:00,691 --> 01:41:02,611
I think you know where.

1191
01:41:02,611 --> 01:41:04,401
It hasn't been that long, has it?

1192
01:41:04,401 --> 01:41:05,611
What?

1193
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:09,121
You know, uh...
I'll ask Tony.

1194
01:41:09,911 --> 01:41:11,621
Maybe he'll know something.

1195
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:16,211
You knew she was here
the whole time?

1196
01:41:26,511 --> 01:41:28,511
This belongs to you.

1197
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:30,101
It's from her.

1198
01:41:43,611 --> 01:41:48,201
"Matt. Please don't think
that I'm running away from you.

1199
01:41:48,321 --> 01:41:51,621
"I was so overwhelmed
when you asked me to move in.

1200
01:41:51,621 --> 01:41:53,791
"I couldn't speak.

1201
01:41:53,911 --> 01:41:56,711
"My answer. Of course. Is yes.

1202
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:59,791
I love you.
and can't wait to come home. "

1203
01:42:03,301 --> 01:42:05,591
I'm not going to apologize
for what I've done.

1204
01:42:09,221 --> 01:42:11,221
This is for me to live with now.

1205
01:42:16,101 --> 01:42:18,101
Now you see me for who I am.

1206
01:42:26,321 --> 01:42:28,111
Yes, I do.

1207
01:42:39,211 --> 01:42:40,421
Hey. Where you goin'?

1208
01:42:40,501 --> 01:42:41,581
Hey.

1209
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:43,211
Where you goin'?

1210
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:44,801
I knowwhere she is.

1211
01:42:45,591 --> 01:42:47,301
All right.
Tell me what happens.

1212
01:42:49,091 --> 01:42:52,221
That guy. He's um...

1213
01:42:52,301 --> 01:42:54,511
more drama
than a Mexican soap opera.

1214
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:57,391
Luke! This...

1215
01:42:57,521 --> 01:42:58,601
This is over.

1216
01:42:58,681 --> 01:43:00,191
- What's over?
- Us.

1217
01:43:02,021 --> 01:43:04,021
How can it be over?
We haven't even started yet.

1218
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:05,691
I'm not who you think I am.

1219
01:43:07,111 --> 01:43:08,401
I used you.

1220
01:43:23,581 --> 01:43:24,591
Taxi!

1221
01:43:26,091 --> 01:43:27,091
Come on.

1222
01:43:41,391 --> 01:43:42,401
Hey!

1223
01:43:43,521 --> 01:43:45,021
Hey, come on!

1224
01:43:45,691 --> 01:43:47,611
God!

1225
01:43:51,611 --> 01:43:52,701
Hey!

1226
01:43:54,821 --> 01:43:56,621
Hey! Hey!

1227
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:01,791
Sorry.

1228
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:03,001
Thanks.

1229
01:44:03,121 --> 01:44:05,211
- Goin' to Wicker Park.
- Yeah, right away.

1230
01:45:06,601 --> 01:45:08,191
Your attention. Please.

1231
01:45:08,311 --> 01:45:11,691
Flight 862 service to London
is now boarding.

1232
01:45:38,591 --> 01:45:39,601
Hi!

1233
01:45:41,011 --> 01:45:42,811
There you are!

1234
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:45,891
Where've you been?
Your flight got in an hour ago.

1235
01:45:46,021 --> 01:45:47,811
I've been down
to luggage claim and back.

1236
01:45:49,111 --> 01:45:50,611
- Rebecca.
- Hey.

1237
01:45:50,691 --> 01:45:51,901
l, um...

1238
01:45:52,021 --> 01:45:53,611
What's the matter?

1239
01:45:53,691 --> 01:45:55,321
Rough flight home?

1240
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:57,821
Did you bring me back
that little Chinese dress?

1241
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:03,411
- Rebecca...
- You okay, Sweetie?

1242
01:46:05,201 --> 01:46:06,621
I didn't go to China.

1243
01:46:08,711 --> 01:46:10,131
What are you talking about?

1244
01:46:10,211 --> 01:46:13,211
Hi, Alex. You're never gonna
believe what happened.

1245
01:46:13,301 --> 01:46:15,091
Matthew's back in town.

1246
01:46:16,591 --> 01:46:18,091
I can't marry you.

1247
01:46:19,091 --> 01:46:20,721
It would be a huge mistake.

1248
01:46:20,801 --> 01:46:23,511
You're gonna have to help me out, baby.
Did I do something wrong?

1249
01:46:23,511 --> 01:46:26,521
No, you didn't...
You didn't do anything wrong.

1250
01:46:26,521 --> 01:46:27,601
Rebecca, I...

1251
01:46:28,901 --> 01:46:31,691
I've been doing something wrong
for the last two years.

1252
01:46:32,611 --> 01:46:35,191
I'm not...
I'm not this person.

1253
01:46:35,191 --> 01:46:37,611
I can't go back with you.
I can't do this.

1254
01:46:38,201 --> 01:46:40,621
I was gonna meet him in the park,
but he didn't show up.

1255
01:46:41,701 --> 01:46:43,991
Yeah... I know.

1256
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:45,411
What do you mean?

1257
01:46:45,501 --> 01:46:50,791
Lisa. I've been doing some really...
horrible and selfish things.

1258
01:46:50,921 --> 01:46:52,591
What are you talking about?

1259
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:54,801
I've been keeping you apart.

1260
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:58,091
When we met two years ago,
I was in love with someone else.

1261
01:46:58,091 --> 01:47:01,091
And she just came back
into my life.

1262
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:04,511
She broke my heart...
and I'm sorry!

1263
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:06,391
Oh, my God.

1264
01:47:12,191 --> 01:47:15,111
l... Rebecca, I know...

1265
01:47:15,111 --> 01:47:17,031
I know that I'm still in love with her.

1266
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:19,821
I just... I needed you to know.

1267
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:21,911
Knowwhat?

1268
01:47:23,121 --> 01:47:25,121
Know what, Matthew?

1269
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:28,411
That I'm not the girl
that can break your heart?
