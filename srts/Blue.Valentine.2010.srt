00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,508
OK.

173
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,434
You remember what to do
when Pa snores, right?

174
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,730
- Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
- That's my girl.

175
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,557
OK, go have fun.

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,642
[Cindy] All right, run to Mama!

177
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,478
Come on, you can do it!
Come on, sweetie pie.

178
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,777
Yay, that was great.

179
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,318
That was great.
All right, you ready to go inside?

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,738
So what's with him,
you two fighting again?

181
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,243
[Cindy] We'll talk about it later.

182
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,869
[Frankie] Why isn't Daddy
gonna come in?

183
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,992
[Cindy] I don't know.

184
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,730
- Mr. Benatti, good to meet you.
- Have a seat.

185
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,982
What kind of job are you applying for?

186
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,531
- Driver? Helper? Packer?
- Whatever, one that pays.

187
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,608
- Do you have any experience at all?
- Sure.

188
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,781
Where have you worked?

189
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,989
I mean, you know,
I've helped people move before.

190
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,448
You mean, what are my jobs?

191
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,783
But you've never worked
for a moving company?

192
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,992
No.

193
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,170
OK, so that would be "no experience."
Where are you from?

194
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,088
- Florida.
- And how long have you been here?

195
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,337
- Like two years.
- And where are you living?

196
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,340
- I live in Brooklyn.
- Can you get here every day?

197
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,013
- Yeah, I'll get here.
- I need you here by 7:00am.

198
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,340
I'll get here.

199
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,675
- Ready?
- Yeah.

200
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,852
- Hold it. There you go.
- All right, Marshall.

201
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,180
- Good job!
- You're a man amongst men. No homo!

202
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,316
[Marshall] Sit up, son! Sit up, sit up!

203
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,691
Don't worry about it. You ain't
a professional yet, that's all.

204
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,652
[Dean] How do you meet girls?

205
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,700
[Marshall] I just walk up,
talk to them.

206
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,827
Whatever comes in my mind
at that moment.

207
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,533
- [man] He honks the horn.
- I gets out of the truck.

208
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,539
I get out the truck and talk to 'em.

209
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,461
[man] Or he screams out,
like, "chocolate thunder."

210
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,167
[laughing]

211
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,505
[Dean] See, I don't know. I feel like
men are more romantic than women.

212
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,757
When we get married,
we marry, like, one girl.

213
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,716
'Cause we 're resistant the whole way,
until we meet one girl and we think,

214
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,552
"I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry
this girl, she's so great. ”

215
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,559
But it seems like girls get
to a place, they just kinda pick,

216
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,140
pick the best option or something.

217
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,067
I know girls that get married, they're
like, "Oh, he's got a good job."

218
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,395
I mean, they spend their whole life
looking for Prince Charming,

219
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,947
and then they... then they marry,
they marry the guy

220
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,741
that's got a good job
and who's gonna stick around.

221
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,115
[man] Take your share and go home,
OK? Let's call it a good night.

222
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,411
Thanks, Jamie.

223
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,951
[ukulele playing]

224
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,276
Lemme tell you something.
When I get old, I'm gonna look good.

225
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,780
When you get old,
you're gonna look like him.

226
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,533
What do you mean "when" you get old?

227
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,955
It's gonna be a long time,
another 50 years.

228
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,122
[Marshall] Damn, it look like
World War III in this motherfucker.

229
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,296
[Jamie] OK, look, box everything in
the kitchen, bag everything upstairs.

230
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,545
Let's get this truck loaded,
up to Pennsylvania and back by tonight.

231
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,791
[man speaks indistinctly]

232
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,255
- This is a small, small room here.
- Here we go.

233
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,009
How's all the stuff gonna fit in here?

234
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,006
[Jamie] it's probably not gonna,
so strip the furniture.

235
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,554
OK, I'll bring you boxes,
you start unpacking, placing.

236
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,849
Flatten all the cartons,
we'll get 'em outta here.

237
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,393
- What happens to all the other stuff?
- [Jamie] Not our problem.

238
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,603
[exhales heavily]

239
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,458
[Marshall] Come on, come on,
speed it up, speed it up.

240
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,132
Gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go.

241
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,299
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

242
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,879
[Marshall] We gotta go.
We got another job to do, we gotta go.

243
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,425
[Jamie] Dean, you ready?
Let's get outta here, OK?

244
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,636
Job's over, here.
I'll give you your pay.

245
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,345
- One hundred...
- Damn.

246
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,898
One hundred and ten...
and 20 is part of your tip, OK?

247
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,648
Let's go, we've got
a two-hour ride back to the city.

248
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,564
Walter!

249
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,117
OK... Don't be mad.

250
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,537
I hung some of your stuff,
I hope it's OK.

251
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,912
You wanna walk in here?
You don't wanna get wheeled in here.

252
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,493
This is your new house.

253
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,712
I hung your uniform. I hope that's OK.

254
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,290
It's just so handsome, you know?

255
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,590
I noticed you had a lot of matches,
so I stuck 'em on the wall.

256
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,517
If you don't like it, you can
just take 'em down. It's tape.

257
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,351
Do you wanna sit down in the chair?

258
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,398
- OK.
- Please.

259
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,272
Here, let me get this out of your way.

260
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,400
You got it?

261
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,026
OK, Walter,
I'm gonna get in trouble, I gotta go,

262
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,736
but I'm gonna show you a few things, OK?
That's your shoes, see?

263
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,492
- Hey, Dean we gotta go, all right?
- Yo. OK.

264
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,323
- I'll meet you in the truck.
- OK.

265
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,792
And... He's not the boss of me,
by the way. What else?

266
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,374
All your stuffs in here.
That's your pants, sweaters, shirts.

267
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,461
Hey, Walter, is this your wife?
Is this you and your wife?

268
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:48,878
[exhales]

269
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,056
She was a beautiful woman.

270
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,676
OK, nice to meet ya.

271
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,270
- Thank you.
- Good luck here.

272
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,517
OK. I'll see ya down the road.

273
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,940
[birds chirping]

274
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,246
[shovel scraping]

275
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,472
- [sniffles]
- I'm sorry.

276
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,268
I know.

277
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,600
Don't be sorry, baby.

278
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,821
Oh, fuck.

279
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm just tired, you know.

280
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm just fucking tired.

281
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,712
Come here, boy!

282
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,380
[Dean] Maybe it's because we didn't
make it comfy enough in there.

283
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,547
Maybe we made it too girly.

284
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,392
- Too girly?
- Yeah.

285
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:24,690
[Dean] Well, I think it...
Maybe we just need to put something...

286
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,894
...like a nice blanket
in there for him to lay on.

287
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,820
- [Frankie] OK.
- [Dean] You think that's a good idea?

288
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,068
- [Frankie] Yeah, let's get a blanket.
- [Dean] OK, buddy.

289
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,368
[Frankie] But don't take
the one I usually do.

290
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,071
[Dean] OK, you better ask your mom
which blanket's OK to use,

291
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,407
because I don't want to get in trouble.

292
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,244
- [Frankie] OK. Will you open this up?
- [Dean] Watch your hands.

293
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,671
But close it quickly,
'cause the dog is in there.

294
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,007
Can you take the trash out?

295
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,460
Yeah. Baby, do you know
where we put that...

296
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,132
I got an idea.

297
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,062
Hello?

298
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,357
I'm calling to see if I can make
a reservation for tonight.

299
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,811
- I have a gift certificate.
- [whispering] No.

300
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,567
What's our options?

301
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,951
They have Cupid's Cove room available.

302
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,950
I'm not going to some cheesy sex motel.
I'm on call tomorrow.

303
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,827
What else? That's it?

304
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, and there's a Future Room.
Can you hold on one second?

305
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,295
- Baby, will you make the decision?
- I'm on call. I can't go.

306
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,462
Baby, please.

307
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,006
- Listen to me for a second.
- What do you want me to say?

308
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,085
Can you hold on one second?
Listen to me for a second.

309
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,421
Would you stop cleaning for one minute?

310
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,428
- What?
- I'm asking you. Please.

311
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,057
Let's get outta here.
We gotta get outta here.

312
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,136
[sighs]

313
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,689
Baby, we have to get out of this house.

314
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,063
Let's go get drunk and make love.

315
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:57,321
- Now, do you want the Cupid's Cove...
- Dean, I don't wanna...

316
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,528
...or do you want the Future Room?

317
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,368
Make a decision, baby, please.

318
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,166
I don't want to get in the car
at 7:30 and drive for two hours.

319
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,588
OK. I'll make the decision.
The Future Room.

320
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,841
For two.

321
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,047
- Periera.
- You're crazy.

322
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,807
[Dean] Thanks.

323
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,814
Pack your bags, baby,
we're going to the future.

324
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,865
[man chuckles] Oh, my God.
ls that Cindy Heller?

325
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:53,715
- Bobby Ontario?
- [laughing] How are you?

326
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,260
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm... you know, I'm hanging in there.

327
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,340
Wow. Wow. it's been a while.

328
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,014
- How about you?
- Yeah, here.

329
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,317
Here. Been here,
stayed here, never left here.

330
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,520
Here's good, here's good.

331
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,072
- Married?
- Married.

332
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,117
- Married.
- That's crazy. Lucky guy.

333
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,159
- Have you been faithful to him?
- [laughs nervously]

334
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,545
That's a strange question to ask
somebody you haven't seen in forever.

335
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,247
Yeah, well, you know...

336
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,048
- Seriously.
- Yes.

337
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,750
Yes you have, or yes you haven't?

338
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,461
Yes... I have, I mean, I have...
I have been...

339
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,886
Why are you looking at me like that?

340
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,845
I'm not looking at you like anything.

341
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,933
Oh, OK.

342
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,188
- Yeah.
- Uh.

343
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,618
Come on, let's go.

344
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,697
Let's go.

345
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,877
What you thinking?

346
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,049
What's on your mind?

347
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,059
You're never gonna guess
who I saw at the liquor mart.

348
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,523
- [Dean] Richard Grieco?
- No, but good guess.

349
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,478
Jon Bon Jovi.

350
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,109
Bobby Ontario.

351
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,379
What the fuck was he doing there?

352
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,333
[Cindy] I don't know...
I mean, buying liquor, I guess.

353
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,428
[Dean] Jesus.

354
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,804
- How come you're just telling me now?
- 'Cause I'm telling you now.

355
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,260
How come you didn't tell me
when we were there?

356
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,347
I don't know, 'cause I was flustered
and I'm telling you now.

357
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,353
- You talked to him?
- No. I mean like,

358
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,187
- "Hi, bye, how are you..."
- How are you?

359
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,775
- Yeah, he asked me how I was.
- And you told him?

360
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:28,202
I mean, I didn't want to,
but we were stuck there.

361
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,281
We were in the same store,
buying things together at the same time.

362
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:38,333
I wish you'd seen him. I wish you'd...
You wouldn't feel so bad. He's fat...

363
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,210
- What do I care?
- I don't know.

364
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,041
What do I care if he's fat or not?

365
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,633
What does that mean?
Make me feel better?

366
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,635
I don't know. 'Cause he's a loser.

367
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,726
What does that have to do with me?

368
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,600
Whether he's a loser or he's fat or not?
What the fuck do I care?

369
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,101
I don't... What!?

370
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:02,904
What are you saying that for? That
would make me feel better, he's fat?

371
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,027
So what? If he was in good shape,
I shouldn't feel good?

372
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,154
I said the wrong thing.
I'm nervous, OK?

373
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,826
- What do you mean you're nervous?
- I feel funny, because you feel funny.

374
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,459
You're nervous 'cause I feel funny?

375
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,001
- What does that mean?
- I feel like I said the wrong thing.

376
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,378
I feel like I shouldn't have
said anything.

377
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,335
Really? That's an option?

378
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,549
You run into Bobby Ontario
and it's an option not to tell me?

379
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,269
I feel like you're upset,
and I upset you and I'm sorry.

380
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,062
And I said the wrong thing.

381
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,941
Baby... you can do whatever you want.

382
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,361
OK.

383
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,321
I'm sorry.

384
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,779
[Dean sighs]

385
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,037
Fuck.

386
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,628
- What are you doing?
- I gotta pee.

387
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,176
- Where, in this person's house?
- Fuck you.

388
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,799
Fuck me.

389
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,757
[indistinct shouting]

390
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,600
[whistle blows]

391
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,109
[shouting continues]

392
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,452
- [whistle blows]
- [applause]

393
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,471
Hi.

394
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,847
- What are you doing?
- Research.

395
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,643
Really, research.

396
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,693
So what, I mean,
you're supposed to be a quadriplegic?

397
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,564
No, quads can't use their arms.
I'm a paraplegic.

398
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,483
Really?

399
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,370
Hi.

400
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:06,253
Why do you have to act like
such a freak all the time, huh? Huh?

401
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,171
Come over.

402
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,546
- Come on.
- I can't.

403
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,844
- I can't.
- You know you want it.

404
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,013
I gotta go get Gramma.

405
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,640
I just came to say hi.

406
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,731
- Call you later.
- Yeah. Whatever!

407
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,270
- [woman] Oh! I thought you were Dad.
- Just us.

408
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:35,233
- [woman] How was the beauty parlor?
- Oh, lovely, just lovely.

409
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,612
Good.

410
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,949
What did it feel like
when you fell in love?

411
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,868
Ooh...

412
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,286
Oh, dear.

413
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,956
I don't think I found it.

414
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,630
[Cindy] Even with Grandpa?

415
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,762
Maybe a little in the beginning.

416
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,887
Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

417
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:05,437
[Gramma] He didn't really have
any regard for me as a person.

418
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,765
You've gotta be careful of that.

419
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:11,728
You've gotta be careful that
the person that you fall in love...

420
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,605
...is worth it to you.

421
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,240
[Cindy] I don't ever want
to be like my parents.

422
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,869
I know that they must have loved
each other at one time, right?

423
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,417
Did they just get it all out of the way
before they had me?

424
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,790
[Pa] We're supposed to
eat this garbage?

425
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,125
Huh?!

426
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,752
[woman] I'm sorry.

427
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,922
- Do you want me to make you some eggs?
- [Pa] No!

428
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,018
I want you to enjoy
your goddamned dinner!

429
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,309
[Cindy] How do you trust your feelings
when they can just disappear like that?

430
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:59,734
[Gramma] I think the only way you can
find out is... to have the feeling.

431
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,320
You're a good person, honey.

432
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,909
I think you have the right to say,
"Yes, I do trust. "

433
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,786
"I trust myself. "

434
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,467
[panting, moaning]

435
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,603
[grunting]

436
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,604
[heavy panting]

437
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,322
- [moans]
- What?

438
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,991
What, what?

439
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,831
- Fuck!
- Shit.

440
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,667
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

441
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,761
[locking door]

442
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,939
[urinating]

443
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,708
[Cindy] "Somehow, she didn't want to
confess to him that she was still wary

444
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,461
of all those people who'd
seemed to want to care about her.

445
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,260
He touched her cheek gently,
caressing her.

446
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,053
Her heart was beating so loudly
that surely he could hear it. ”

447
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,634
Arms up.

448
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,139
[Cindy] "He smoothed her hair back,

449
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,722
the touch of his fingers sending
waves of awareness through her.

450
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,979
He was going to kiss her.
That was what she wanted, wasn't it?

451
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,562
So why did she feel as if she trembled
on the edge of a precipice,

452
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,693
ready to topple over in an instant?

453
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:07,073
Then his lips found hers
and she stopped thinking at all,

454
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,996
only feeling,
feeling the tenderness of his kiss,

455
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,915
the strength of his arms around her...

456
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:19,002
...the steady beat of his heart under
her hand as she turned into his arms.

457
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,008
There is a precipice,
and she was falling.

458
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,962
Head over heels.
Falling in love with him.

459
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,213
Chapter 11 ..."

460
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,094
Hi.

461
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,096
- Hi.
- Hi.

462
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:36,349
- I want a cigarette.
- No, Gramma, it's bedtime.

463
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,684
You're in bed.
You can't have a cigarette now, OK?

464
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,940
Do you want me
to keep reading or are you tired?

465
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,442
I need a cigarette!

466
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,457
[indistinct chattering]

467
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,555
[knocking on door]

468
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,477
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

469
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,482
Why?

470
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,815
You think I stole that money, don't you?

471
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,235
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

472
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,912
Look, I've stolen money before, OK?
I know what it's like to get busted.

473
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,285
- That's what it feels like.
- OK.

474
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,412
I didn't steal it. I got a job.

475
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,244
- OK? This is my job.
- All right.

476
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,295
- All right? I make money.
- OK, I got it.

477
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,170
Money I can take girls out
on dates with.

478
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,462
Just so you know.

479
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,052
Good to know. OK.

480
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,645
- What's your name?
- Go away.

481
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,064
- "Go away"?
- Go away.

482
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,732
That's a weird name.

483
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,893
OK, hold on a second.

484
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:10,068
I wanna give you something.
Look at that. That's my business card.

485
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,951
I don't have a phone...
or a phone number,

486
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,954
but if you call
this number right here...

487
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,165
...and then you ask for me...

488
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,417
- ...they'll tell me you called.
- Great.

489
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,169
Who should I say is calling?

490
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,013
[door beeps]

491
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,146
Whoa!

492
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,565
Where are we, huh?

493
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,946
We're inside a robot's vagina.

494
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,907
[chuckling]

495
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,209
[Cindy] Was this the only one
that they had?

496
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:06,336
[Dean] I told you, you know...
they had Cupid's Cove or this.

497
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,212
You want me to see
if we can get Cupid's Cove?

498
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,634
[Cindy] I'm gonna make a drink.

499
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,925
There's no windows.

500
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,557
Cool bed, huh? Check this out.

501
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,317
- [bed humming]
- [Dean] Whoa!

502
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,565
The bed turns.
Hey, did you see this?

503
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,570
Hey.

504
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,156
Hey, look at me.

505
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,661
- I don't think that there's a fridge.
- [Dean laughing]

506
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,462
[cawing]

507
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,592
Hey, that's how they laugh
in the future. Like this...

508
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,710
[cawing]

509
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,044
[Dean laughs]

510
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,713
[cawing]

511
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,344
Oh, God.

512
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:01,099
I thought the whole point of coming here
was to have a night without kids.

513
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,220
[phone ringing]

514
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,899
Hello? Yeah, hold on.

515
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,272
Here, sweetheart, it's your mommy.
She wants to talk to you.

516
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,780
- Hi, Mom.
- [Cindy] Hi, sweetie!

517
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,736
[wooing noises]

518
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,704
Yes.

519
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,249
OK, honey. Don't forget
to go potty before you get into bed, OK?

520
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,416
Bye... Bye, I love you!

521
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,293
Frankie, this is
how they laugh in the future.

522
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,088
[cawing]

523
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,672
Try it.

524
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,632
Huh?

525
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,759
[muffled blowing sound]

526
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,514
Frankie, are you tooting?
Is that you tooting?

527
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,729
[repeats sound]

528
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,270
Frankie... I can hear...

529
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,832
I love you like crazy. I gotta go, OK?

530
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,538
Kiss, kiss. [kissing sounds]

531
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,502
Bye-bye.

532
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,802
What are you doing?

533
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,684
What? What's it look like I'm doing?

534
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,022
Getting all wet and naked.

535
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,531
I'm gonna go order some food.
Do you want some?

536
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,153
You know what I like.

537
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,160
Can you close the door?

538
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,752
Oh.

539
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,972
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

540
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,871
[mumbling]

541
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,041
[Cindy] All right.

542
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,460
Come up.

543
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,333
Come up.

544
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,686
[woman moaning]

545
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,690
[beeping]

546
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,705
What are you so grumpy about?

547
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,499
Oh, I don't know. I don't know why.

548
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,886
- [Cindy] Do you want a drink?
- [Dean] Yes, please.

549
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,385
[J' Penny & the Quarters: You and Me]

550
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,922
- Hey, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

551
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,099
You're Gramma.
It's great to meet you.

552
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,926
Cindy, come on.

553
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,229
Could you talk to me
for five minutes, please?

554
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,977
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

555
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,933
Gramma, you know you have
an amazing granddaughter?

556
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,485
- Oh, of course I do.
- She's unbelievable.

557
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,697
I got these for you.
Would you please take them?

558
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,778
Cindy, come on,
would you give me five minutes?

559
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,739
This is ridiculous.
You're not even gonna talk to me?

560
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,665
Come on, Cindy.

561
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,419
I'm trying to say I'm sorry,
and you're acting like a total bitch!

562
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,630
[Dean] I don't know, I just
feel like I should just stop...

563
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,221
You know, just stop thinking
about it, but I can't.

564
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:58,182
Maybe I've seen too many movies,
you know, love at first sight.

565
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,726
- Anyone call?
- No.

566
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,982
Thanks.

567
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,650
[Dean] What do you think
about love at first sight?

568
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,318
You think you can love somebody
just by looking at 'em?

569
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,112
- [Marshall] By looking at 'em?
- But the thing is, man,

570
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,942
I felt like I knew her. You know?
You ever get that feeling?

571
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,904
[Marshall] Yeah, like, you've seen her
before and you just know her...

572
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,120
- Yeah.
- [Marshall] it's a feeling.

573
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,911
But, actually,
you really don't know her.

574
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,545
- Yeah, I probably... I don't, right?
- [Marshall] That's right.

575
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:35,215
- I felt like I did, though.
- If you get a little pussy...

576
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,510
...I think all the mental-ness
will go away from you.

577
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,266
[Dean] You think
I'm too much in my head?

578
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,687
Yeah, too much.

579
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,692
[Marshall] You already know
where she live at, right?

580
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,395
[Dean] No, she was just, like,
visiting her grandmother.

581
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,778
[Marshall] So why don't you go back
to that grandmother...

582
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,612
- ...and ask her where she lives?
- [Dean] I should go back, right?

583
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,579
[Marshall] Yeah. if you like her; yeah.

584
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,203
[Dean] She just seems different,
you know? I don't know.

585
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,159
[Marshall] Wait. How different?

586
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,999
[Dean] I don't know,
I just got a feeling about her.

587
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:14,296
You know when a song comes on
and you just gotta dance?

588
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,748
- Hi.
- [Gramma] Hi.

589
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,959
Do you know
what happened to Walter?

590
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,966
- Who?
- [Dean] Walter.

591
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:01,350
He's the gentlemen that just moved in
across the hall about a month ago.

592
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,559
I don't know anything
or anybody named Walter.

593
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,223
Oh.

594
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,814
OK.

595
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,522
Hey, can I ask you something else?

596
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,657
What's the story with that girl
that was in here like a month ago?

597
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,112
The blonde, the young blonde?

598
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,290
[Dean] I gave her my card,
but she never called me.

599
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,625
What's her name ?

600
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,787
- [Gramma] Cindy.
- [Dean] Cindy.

601
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,420
- Will you tell her I say hi?
- [Gramma] OK. Why not.

602
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,433
Shit.

603
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,425
Do you think I could sit down,
because all these other seats are taken.

604
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,302
- OK.
- Hey, thanks.

605
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,680
You know, I just talked
to your grandmother.

606
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,025
That sounds weird, huh?

607
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,023
- Yeah.
- OK, let me put it into context.

608
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,448
I went out there to see Walter,
who's not there anymore.

609
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,360
That's why I talked to her.

610
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,866
Do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

611
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,539
Yeah, do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

612
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,290
No, I don't know what happened
to that guy, Walter.

613
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,712
What happened?

614
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,959
[tsks]

615
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,717
You gotta do it like that?

616
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,221
- What do you expect?
- What do you mean?

617
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,641
They're old.
Would you want to live like that?

618
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,718
- Like what? In that home?
- [Cindy] Yeah.

619
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,897
Well, no but I'm not getting old
and he's a dummy for dying.

620
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,937
- [Cindy] Walter's a dummy for dying?
- Yeah.

621
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,235
[Cindy] What are you gonna do,
wise guy?

622
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,311
Not do it.

623
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,818
- Are you gonna die?
- Definitely.

624
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,984
Hmm?

625
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,455
- What'd you say?
- I said definitely.

626
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,532
Well, with that
kind of attitude, you will.

627
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,456
Don't do it. it's for suckers.

628
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,704
Don't do it.

629
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,624
- [Cindy] What are you gonna do?
- Just not do it.

630
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,883
I went out there to give him this.

631
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,836
Isn't that nice? I found it.

632
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,259
Look at that.

633
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,349
- Is that him?
- Yeah, and his lady.

634
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,178
- isn't he handsome?
- [Cindy] Look at her, she's so pretty.

635
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,893
[Dean] So she's probably nuts, then.

636
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,565
In my experience, the prettier
a girl is, the more nuts she is.

637
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,323
Which makes you insane.

638
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,865
You're probably nutty-coo-coo crazy.

639
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,659
It's not your fault.
You know, it's just like...

640
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,504
Everybody treats you different.

641
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,458
Like, you make jokes and they're
not funny, but people laugh anyway.

642
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,042
That's gotta make you nuts.

643
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,347
I like how you can compliment
and insult somebody at the same time.

644
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,924
In equal measure.

645
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,725
What's an insult about that?

646
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,561
That I'm crazy and I'm not funny.

647
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,436
Well... I don't know if you're
not funny, tell me a joke.

648
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,025
So there's a child molester
and a little boy walking into the woods.

649
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,147
[Dean chuckles]

650
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:48,031
The child molester and the little boy
keep walking further and further,

651
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,738
and it's getting darker and darker
and they're going deeper and deeper

652
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,040
into the woods and the child molester...

653
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,244
...and the little boy looks up
at the child molester and he says,

654
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,295
[high-pitched voice]
"Gee, mister, I'm getting scared!"

655
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,213
And the child molester
looks down at him and says,

656
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,418
"You think you're scared, kid?
I gotta walk outta here alone."

657
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,635
You don't think that's funny?

658
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,274
- No, I'm sorry.
- I do.

659
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,686
[Dean] You get along
with your grandma, huh?

660
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,487
Yeah, she makes me laugh.

661
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:29,611
Nobody else talks in my family.
And when they talk, they just yell.

662
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,950
[Dean] I'm never getting married.

663
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:39,788
[Dean] This is a nice place, you live.
You like it?

664
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,999
- It's all right.
- Where you wanna go?

665
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,926
I wanna go away to school.

666
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,968
- What are you gonna study?
- Medicine.

667
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,933
[hissing] Really?

668
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,931
- Yeah, really.
- Yeah, right.

669
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,512
Yeah, right.

670

01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,237
- OK?
- [door knob jiggles]

840
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,940
Let me out.

841
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,024
[pounds on door]

842
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,444
Open the door. Open the door.

843
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,494
[pounding continues]

844
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,912
Open the door.

845
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,449
Open the door.

846
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,001
Hey! Open this door!

847
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,922
- [exhales heavily]
- Hey! Open the door!

848
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,380
Open the door!

849
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,470
Hey!

850
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,131
Open the door!

851
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,509
Can you open the door?

852
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,429
Can you open the door?

853
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,311
Go.

854
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,729
[laughing]

855
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,994
No. No!

856
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,585
[laughing] OW... ow. OW.

857
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,711
[Dean] What is going on? What kind
of operation are you running...

858
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,421
- Stop.
- ...around here?

859
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,007
OK.

860
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,728
[Dean laughing]

861
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,941
[Cindy yelling]

862
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,324
[man] Do not touch
the young lady in my taxi!

863
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,491
Please, sir!
Don't touch her back there, please?

864
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:33,420
- Thank you! Thank you very much.
- Come on! Why not?

865
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,544
Sir! Please there's no sex in my taxi!

866
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,297
Do not touch the young lady in my taxi!

867
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,754
I'll have you know that she was
putting the moves on me.

868
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,965
That's not true.
Would you believe a face like this?

869
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,551
- That doesn't...
- Look at that face. Look at that face.

870
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,729
[man] I will not have you trying
something that's wrong in my car!

871
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:51,930
What's wrong?

872
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,107
[man] This is my car,
this is like my home.

873
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,059
You're in my home now, OK?

874
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,895
It's not my business
what you do with this girl,

875
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,072
but you're not gonna do it in my cab.

876
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,668
[exhales softly]

877
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,650
[Cindy groaning]

880
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,839
Oh, God.

881
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,257
[panting continues]

882
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,795
God. Oh, no, no, no.

883
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,132
No, no, no, no, no...

884
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,636
No.

885
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,852
[laughing]

886
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:18,024
Oh, my God.

887
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,818
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

888
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,909
[Bobby] Good job.

889
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:48,926
[undoes zipper]

890
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,924
[urinating]

891
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,733
[indistinct chattering]

892
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,911
Hi.

893
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,386
Hi.

894
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:14,800
You OK?

895
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,348
Yeah, you OK?

896
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,439
Yeah, you OK?

897
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,693
[Dean] You gonna talk to me or what?

898
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,696
You gonna tell me what's goin' on?

899
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:38,740
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I don't know what you want me to say.

900
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,871
I want you to tell me what's going on.
I wanna know.

901
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,832
You got me feeling sick, you know?

902
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,003
I'm very intuitive.

903
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,963
I know there's something up.

904
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,637
- I don't know what to do.
- OK, you're not gonna tell me?

905
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,812
[train passing]

906
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,311
Stop! Stop, stop! No, no, no, stop!

907
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,109
- You gonna tell me?
- Stop! Come down!

908
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,404
- You gonna tell me?
- Just come down! I'm not kidding you!

909
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,232
- You're gonna tell me what it is?
- Come... Please come down!

910
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,192
Come down. Please... Please stop.

911
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,744
- You want me to go over the edge?
- No, I want you to come down!

912
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,617
- Tell me what it is.
- Come on, it's dangerous!

913
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,698
- You gonna tell me?
- No!

914
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,160
No, stop! Please come on!

915
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,371
Please! I'm pregnant!
Stop, come back, please!

916
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,757
Please come down. Please come down.

917
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,606
Is it mine?

918
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,938
- I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?

919
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:53,944
Maybe.

920
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,573
- Maybe?
- Probably not.

921
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,833
What are you gonna do?

922
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,796
- What am I gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

923
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,383
I don't know...

924
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,011
You're gonna have it? You're not
gonna have it? What are you gonna do?

925
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,803
- You thought about this?
- I don't know.

926
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:26,439
You don't know?

927
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,401
[Dean punches fence]

928
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:44,616
[woman] You've opted for our
vacuum-aspiration abortion today.

929
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,997
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

930
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:52,253
They're sensitive in nature,
so if at any time, you're uncomfortable,

931
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,174
you just let me know, OK?

932
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:02,058
At what age were you
when you first had intercourse?

933
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:07,013
- Thirteen.
- OK.

934
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,103
That's not unusual.

935
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,444
OK, and how many sexual partners

936
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:21,027
would you say you've had
from when you first began?

937
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,326
Maybe...

938
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,871
...twenty... twenty...

939
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,049
- ...twenty-five?
- GK.

940
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,969
Do you know
which partner you were with

941
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,217
at the time that you became pregnant?

942
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,556
CK. And is that partner
supportive to you?

943
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,720
Um...

944
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,812
No. OK.

945
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,190
[phone ringing]

946
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,151
[inhaling deeply]

947
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:05,739
[man] Good, all right, now I'm gonna
put my hand on your belly...

948
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,368
...and then I'm gonna
introduce a finger.

949
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,669
You're gonna feel it.
OK, there you are.

950
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,621
- [groaning]
- [man] All right...

951
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,253
That's it, OK, good.

952
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,337
Deep breathing. That's it.
All right, I feel the uterus.

953
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:24,390
Indeed, it's probably
11 and a half, 12 weeks.

954
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,684
It's in a safe position
for the procedure.

955
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:32,107
OK, I'm gonna insert a speculum.
it's gonna cause some pressure.

956
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,977
Here it goes, this is it.

957
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:39,064
That's it. I know it's uncomfortable.
I know it's uncomfortable.

958
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:43,697
But as much as you can relax,
the easier it goes, OK.

959
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,074
It's set right where I need to have it.

960
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:49,157
Good work. Keep that breathing.

961
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,493
- You're making me breathe hard.
- [woman] You're doing great.

962
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:56,082
[man] The next thing I'm gonna do is I
want to give you some local anesthesia.

963
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,712
It's a little uncomfortable,
so what I want you to do...

964
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,673
Right now, I'm gonna
give you the first injection.

965
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,754
Take a giant breath and cough.

966
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:07,012
Go ahead. Breath... Cough.

967
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,141
OK, fine, fine, fine.

968
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:16,226
OK. I'm just gonna
put that down and let it take effect.

969
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:21,781
Breathe deeply, slowly, deeply...

970
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,243
What I'm gonna do
is apply an instrument,

971
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:28,037
so I can hold the cervix still.

972
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,661
Shouldn't feel this.
Maybe a little pressure.

973
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,914
- I can't.
- [woman] Oh, sweetheart, are you OK?

974
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,336
[man] Cindy?

975
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,081
- Stop.
- [woman] OK. OK.

976
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,134
- Stop.
- [man] OK, I'm sorry and I will stop.

977
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:46,924
All right, you wanna sit up?
OK, all right.

978
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:51,682
You want me to just stop
the whole procedure, is that correct?

979
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,605
All right, I'm gonna step out.

980
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,523
- Felicia...
- [Felicia] Yeah.

981
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,357
- Do you wanna put your things back on?
- Can I see my...?

982
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,319
- Can I see my friend?
- Sure, honey.

983
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,414
Let's do it.

984
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,500
Let's be a family.

985
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,348
Let's be a family.

986
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,288
[Cindy] You don't have to do this,
you know.

987
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,371
It's not your fault.

988
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,961
[Dean] I love you.

989
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,457
I love you, too.

990
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,298
[phone ringing]

991
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:13,486
Hey, it's me Cindy. Hi.

992
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,909
We need you to come in...

993
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,958
[groans] Who else did you call?

994
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:22,663
- I called Janet, and I called...
- I'm out of town, too.

995
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,749
What time is it? What time is it?

996
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,132
Six, seven, eight, nine...

997
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,554
Nine o'clock.

998
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,968
If I'm there at nine?
I'm coming if I'm there at nine.

999
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:32,865
- [phone ringing]
- [Dean yawns]

1000
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:39,239
[grumbles] Cindy!

1001
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,202
Cin!

1002
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,163
I'm gonna fuckin' kill her.

1003
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,256
Yo.

1004
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,459
[man on recording]
This is your 11:00am wake up call.

1005
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,920
OK. Thank you.

1006
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:23,832
Cin?

1007
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,687
[sighs]

1008
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,447
[phone ringing]

1009
01:18:55,522 --> 01:19:00,779
- [indistinct chattering]
- Yeah. Um...

1010
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,656
Where's the nearest bus station?

[Bobby] I just want to say to you,
thanks for making all bets off

1013
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:47,033
and for freeing me of my human decency.

1014
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,335
All your shit is going in the trash.

1015
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,754
All your books
are gonna get fucking ripped up.

1016
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:54,457
You want to go to war? I mean,
we’ll go to wan we'll see who wins.

1017
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:58,716
I know who the fucker is, OK?
And I'm gonna destroy him.

[Bobby] You probably don't even know
what you did.

1020
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,637
I want you to hear something, OK?

1021
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,395
I have never... I have never
cursed at a girl in my life.

1022
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,645
Fuck you!

1023
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,812
Fuck you, bitch!

1024
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,527
Do you understand that?

1025
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:22,610
I'm gonna find him
and I’m gonna fuck his ass up!

1026
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,321
I hope he looks so beautiful to you...

1027
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:29,500
I hope he looks so beautiful
to you when I'm done.

1028
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,077
Do you hear me?

Hey.

1035
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,471
Hey, I'm looking for Dean.

1036
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,097
For Dean. I'm looking for Dean.
You know where he's at?

1037
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,050
- Yeah, I'm Dean.
- Oh, OK.

1038
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,606
[Bobby] Your little boy's
gonna call me Daddy from now on.

1040
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,081
Fuck you! Bitch!

1041
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,258
- [man] Such a little bitch. Pussy.
- Piece of shit!

1042
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,382
- [man] Fuck him up.
- Bitch!

1043
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,010
You fuckin' piece of shit!

1044
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,511
Fucking pussy!

[phone still ringing]

1046
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:43,126
Dr. Feinberg's Office. Mm-hmm.
OK, when were you looking to come in?

1047
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,137
Oh! Busy! Haven't sat down yet.

1048
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,964
What do you have?
Can you walk with me?

1049
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:52,426
I've got a woman in five, Hispanic...
Excuse me.

1050
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:55,308
Doesn't speak much English, and she's
complaining of pain in her left breast.

1051
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,937
All right, I'll be in in a minute.
Oh, hey, you know what I was thinking?

1052
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:02,987
I realize it might be hard for you to
move the whole family up to Riverdale,

1053
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,654
'cause your daughter's
still in school and everything,

1054
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,153
and I thought maybe
you get an apartment.

1055
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,985
You know, work during the week,
drive home on the weekends.

1056
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,706
Wouldn't have to worry about being
lonely. We could hang out together.

1057
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,578
You know, get dinner sometimes.

1058
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,837
Anyway, that was not a proposition.

1059
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,414
- It was just...
- I'm married.

1060
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,751
Just trying to... Just trying to help.

1061
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:28,463
I thought you wanted me there
because I'm good at my job.

1062
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:29,922
Yeah, I thought...

1063
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,843
Anyway... I'll see you in a minute.

1064
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,562
[indistinct chattering]

1065
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:58,037
I can't do that over the phone.
I can't do it over the phone.

1066
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,208
Hold on, please.

1067
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:03,539
Sir, could you just fill that out and
when you're done bring it back up to me?

1068
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,716
[whispering] I don't need this.

1069
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,589
Could you hold on just
one second, please?

1070
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,670
- OK, thank you.
- I was looking for my wife.

1071
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,807
- I don't need that.
- OK, and who is your wife?

1072
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:17,477
- Cynthia.
- Oh, you must be Dean.

1073
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:22,566
OK, yeah, let me get her,
she'll be right with you.

1074
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:27,859
[woman] Cindy, sweetie,
you have a visitor.

1075
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,991
- [Cindy] Who?
- it's your husband.

1076
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,536
- [Cindy exhales]
- [woman] I think he's been drinking.

1077
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,961
- Hi.
- Oh, there you are.

1078
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,879
What are you doing here?

1079
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:48,716
Oh, well, you're awful friendly
right now, aren't ya?

1080
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:53,089
- No, I'm just surprised to see you.
- Oh, this is where the smiles happen.

1081
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,674
This the smile room? Huh?

1082
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,102
You take off, you leave me,
you don't tell me what's going on?

1083
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,807
I was so goddamn worried, I thought
something might of happened to Frankie!

1084
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,358
- I don't know what the hell happened.
- Meems, can you give me a few?

1085
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,902
- You just take off like that?
- I'll be right here if you need me.

1086
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,775
Yeah, Meems, can you give her a few?

1087
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,731
I don't know if there's an emergency...
You're just gone!

1088
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,658
- Frankie's fine. Come on, lets go.
- Well, good to know.

1089
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,361
Cindy, I'm here if you need me.

1090
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,867
- OK, come on, let's go.
- Don't let him brainwash you.

1091
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,495
- Can you give me a hand with this?
- "Don't let him brainwash you"?

1092
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,372
Can you give me a hand?

1093
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,502
Oh, God...

1094
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:35,840
Look, OK, I know everything
got fucked up last night.

1095
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,096
OK?

1096
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,301
Can't believe you'd show up here drunk.

1097
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,478
Hey, I'm talking to you!

1098
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:45,315
- Hey. I know that...
- Can you drive?

1099
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,392
- What?
- I said can you drive?

1100
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:49,524
What do you mean?
What kinda question is that?

1101
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:51,321
Of course I can drive.
I know how to drive...

1102
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,444
Take the keys, go home.

1103
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,821
You don't even care
if I fuckin' can drive.

1104
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,869
You'd love it if I got in
a goddamned accident.

1105
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:00,572
Yeah, I'd love it.
I'd just love it, you're so right.

1106
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,205
[Dean] That's the point. You don't
have any goddamned time anymore.

1107
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:04,910
It all goes to this fucking place.

1108
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,496
And these fucking people
don't give a shit about you.

1109
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,503
- Do they? Hey!
- Just go home!

1110
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,300
[Dean] Hey, come here for a second,
I'm gonna come in there!

1111
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:16,381
I'm gonna come in!
All right, I'm coming.

1112
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:23,016
Just have a seat and we'll be
with you as soon as we can, OK?

1113
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,597
Thank you.

1114
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:29,151
- Are you OK? Is he gone?
- [Cindy] I fucking hate him.

1115
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,731
[Meems] Why don't you just give her
a couple of minutes?

1116
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,532
No. Dean, you can't come back here.

1117
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,200
- [Cindy] Oh, God.
- Dean...

1118
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,572
- [Meems] You can't be back here.
- It's OK, you're OK.

1119
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,871
[Cindy] I can't do this,
I can't take this shit.

1120
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,203
- Come outside with me.
- Dean, I cannot take this shit anymore.

1121
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,083
- Just come outside.
- I cannot take this shit.

1122
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:52,132
I am not going outside with you.
I've had it!

1123
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,209
- I've had it. I've had it.
- Come and talk to me...

1124
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:57,136
I am up to here!
I'm done, OK? I'm done!

1125
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,930
- Let's go outside...
- I'm done. I'm done.

1126
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,474
Look, no... I am done. I am done.

1127
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,520
I'm done with this.
I'm done being angry like this.

1128
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,722
I'm done having you drunk like this.
I am done!

1129
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,228
- Don't close that door!
- I'm closing the door.

1130
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,230
- Don't...
- Don't talk like that.

1131
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,357
- Mimi...
- Hey, don't talk to Mimi.

1132
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:16,190
Hey, Mimi, you know what?
We're gonna take a little minute.

1133
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:18,025
We're just gonna take a second.

1134
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,406
You know what,
this is why I don't talk to you.

1135
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,579
'Cause you go from here to here
in no time at all.

1136
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,907
This is why you talk to me.
Because I'm here.

1137
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,742
This is the only reason
you're talking to me.

1138
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,920
- You fuckin' asshole.
- I'm a fuckin' asshole?

1139
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,668
I'm so out of love with you.

1140
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:34,546
I've got nothing left for you,
nothing, nothing!

1141
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,678
Nothing! There is nothing here for you!
There is nothing here for you!

1142
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:42,429
- I don't love you. I don't...
- Don't say stuff you can't take back.

1143
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:45,386
[Cindy] You fucking asked for it, you
asked me. You asked me. I talk to you.

1144
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:46,937
I couldn't drive you crazy
unless I love you.

1145
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,310
I gave you the goddamn answer
and you don't like it.

1146
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,811
- Are you gonna hit me?
- That's why I don't talk to you.

1147
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:51,938
No, I'm not gonna hit you.

1148
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,894
- You're the bad guy, not me, asshole.
- I'm the bad guy?

1149
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,605
- Yeah, asshole!
- OK.

1150
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,361
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1151
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,442
Yeah, I'm more man than you are,
you fucking cunt.

1152
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,778
- Don't say that shit about being a man.
- I am, I am. I can handle it.

1153
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,863
What is it with this shit
and being a man? What is that?

1154
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,038
What does it even mean?

1155
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,991
- What is that?
- What does it mean?

1156
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:11,123
- What does it mean to be a man?
- You're scaring us, you're scaring us!

1157
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:14,127
- It doesn't mean you can come here...
- Don't say that stuff.

1158
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,925
- "Be a man!" What is that shit?
- I mean, don't bully...

1159
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,128
I'll be a man.
You want me to be a man? Here you go.

1160
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,134
- Is this what men do?
- Oh, just stop it.

1161
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:23,307
- I'm a big man!
- [Meems] Get out!

1162
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,804
- Get out. Stop it!
- Look at me, I'm a big fucking man!

1163
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,477
- I'm being a man!
- No, I'm the man!

1164
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,145
- I'm being a man now.
- Stop it! Stop it, now.

1165
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,599
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Hold on. This is what men do.

1166
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:34,309
I'm tired of talking.
I'm fucking tired of talking.

1167
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,269
- Hey, hey...
- Stop it!

1168
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,196
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1169
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,990
- What are you doing?!
- [Cindy] He's being an asshole.

1170
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,693
- Hey, stop!
- Who are you, by the way?

1171
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:43,993
- Hey, take it easy.
- Who are you?

1172
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:45,821
Who am I? I'm a doctor.
I'm Dr. Feinberg.

1173
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:49,374
You're fuckin' Dr. Feinberg?
You've been e-mailing my wife?

1174
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,622
- Excuse me?
- You're the guy e-mailing my wife?

1175
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,749
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Stop it!

1176
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,173
Don't! Don't! Don't!

1177
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,501
- I'm gonna hit you in five seconds.
- No one is hitting anybody.

1178
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,960
I'm gonna hit you in five seconds...

1179
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,216
- I'm gonna hit you in five seconds!
- Mimi, call the cops.

1180
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,343
- Five! Four!
- They're coming!

1181
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,390
- Will you take it easy?
- Get out!

1182
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,719
- Get out!
- Take it outside, my friend!

1183
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,021
- Two!
- Think about your wife, will you?

1184
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,313
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- You fucking son of a bitch!

1185
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:18,771
- I'm sorry... Look...
- I'm so sorry!

1186
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,198
- I'm so sorry.
- Buddy, get up. Just get up.

1187
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:22,320
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1188
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,743
You got a glass jaw or something?
You can't take one hit?

1189
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:26,195
- All right, that's enough!
- it's one hit!

1190
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,780
What is wrong with you?

1191
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,991
Oh, my God, you fucking son of a bitch!

1192
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,825
You fucking asshole!

1193
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:33,251
I'm gonna kill you!

1194
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,953
- You son of a bitch!
- That's enough.

1195
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,504
You son of a bitch!

1196
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,753
- I fucking hate you!
- [Feinberg] You two, break it up.

1197
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,550
- That's enough.
- Stop it! Don't. Don't.

1198
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:41,877
[Feinberg] Mimi, please!

1199
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,964
Cindy, would you get out
of here? You are done here, get out!

1200
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,548
- Get out! You're done!
- [Cindy] I'm trying to take him!

1201
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,384
She's done?! You're gonna fire my wife?!

1202
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,770
Hey! This is between
you and me, motherfucker.

1203
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,564
Don't you fucking
blame her for that shit!

1204
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,017
- Yeah, you're going to jail, my friend.
- I'm going to jail?

1205
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,149
- [Cindy] Please, come with me!
- [Meems] Just get the hell out of here!

1206
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,401
- [Feinberg] That's it. Keep moving!
- Come on!

1207
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,115
Give me the keys.

1208
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,333
I fucking want a divorce!

1209
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:41,811
[ring bouncing]

1210
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,911
Where are you going?!

1211
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:53,039
What the fuck are you doing!?

1212
01:30:58,411 --> 01:30:59,412
[car door shuts]

1213
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:30,986
[doorbell rings]

1214
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,076
- Hey.
- Mr. Heller.

1215
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,785
- You must be Dean.
- Yeah.

1216
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:42,339
I didn't know if it was pot luck,
so I brought an eggplant.

1217
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:46,001
- Very funny. Come in.
- Thank you.

1218
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:54,516
Let me see. Let me see.

1219
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:55,969
I don't know what you're talking about.
See what?

1220
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,520
- Let me see.
- See me through the flowers?

1221
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,597
- Do you like 'em?
- Oh, babe.

1222
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,102
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

1223
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,607
Like right now, when you're doing that.

1224
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,155
- Sorry!
- Yeah.

1225
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:10,575
Cindy doesn't usually bring
her boyfriends home for dinner.

1226
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,954
So... I'm thinking
this might be serious.

1227
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:17,783
[Gramma chuckles]

1228
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,960
- [woman] Don't listen to him.
- Well, I hope so.

1229
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,706
- You hope so.
- Yes, sir.

1230
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:27,292
-Mmmm
- I mean, I'm pretty serious.

1231
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,300
What do your folks do, Dean?

1232
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,848
Well... I don't know...

1233
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:38,474
My mother, I don't know,
to be honest, what she does.

1234
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:42,065
But my father is a janitor...

1235
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:46,111
...and he's a very talented musician.

1236
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:49,398
- [woman] What does he play?
- Everything.

1237
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,735
He can kind of play
a little bit of everything.

1238
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,740
He's one of those people.

1239
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,448
- [woman] So you don't see your mother?
- No, I don't.

1240
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,750
[woman] Why?
Not that it's my business...

1241
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,499
No, I understand you asking.

1242
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,840
I don't really talk about it very often,
to be honest.

1243
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,595
You know, she just...

1244
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:16,766
When I was ten, she...
my father and her just decided

1245
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,937
that it wasn't, you know, gonna work out

1246
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,185
and she...

1247
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,938
...she met somebody, and I think...

1248
01:33:27,477 --> 01:33:28,899
...that was that.

1249
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:32,607
[Mr. Heller] You graduate
from high school, Dean?

1250
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,159
Well, sir, no, I didn't, I didn't.

1251
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,075
But, you know, I didn't feel like...

1252
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:40,703
...there was a place for me there,
to be honest.

1253
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:45,003
I don't think that high school
is all it's cracked up to be.

1254
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,209
[woman] Cindy's... studying.

1255
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:56,466
- I know. She's...
- it's exciting.

1256
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:59,267
She's about the smartest person
I ever met.

1257
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:01,386
How's it going?

1258
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:04,935
- It's good.
- Yeah?

1259
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:07,642
Mm-hmm. It's really good. Um...

1260
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:13,899
There's one teacher in particular that
I've really enjoyed getting to know.

1261
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:18,737
She says that I have a lot of potential.

1262
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,197
What's her name?

1263
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:22,870
- Professor Comstock.
- Comstock!

1264
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:28,001
- [Dean laughs]
- What's so funny about that?

1265
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:30,961
Teachers, they just always
have these names you know?

1266
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:36,171
It's never like... I don't know...
They always have these names. Comstock.

1267
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:38,348
- Is that funny?
- Yeah.

1268
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,926
I don't know why, sorry. So you...

1269
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:45,480
- What course is that?
- it's a biology course.

1270
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,520
That's good.

1271
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,102
[Mr. Heller] Cindy wants to be a doctor.

1272
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,356
I know, that's...

1273
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,568
She'd be a great doctor.
I wish she'd be my doctor.

1274
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:00,870
I'd trust her.

1275
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:03,494
A lot of these doctors,
they're just in it for the money.

1276
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:06,497
It would make me relieved to know
that someone like Cindy

1277
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,045
was my doctor, or my kid's doctor.

1278
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:13,629
[woman] She's got a lot ahead of her.
it's really exciting.

1279
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:20,469
- You know I'm not good enough for you.
- Stop it.

1280
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:21,891
- it's true.
- Stop it.

1281
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:23,718
- Baby, it's true.
- No, it's not.

1282
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:26,224
- It is true.
- You're hurting my feelings.

1283
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,147
- Don't say that.
- No, but nobody is.

1284
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:34,738
You know, so as long as...
that's the case, I want the job.

1285
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:38,524
[moaning]

1286
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:41,819
[Dean] Baby...

1287
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,160
- What?
- I got you a present.

1288
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,459
That's it. Hold on... Boom!

1289
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:52,080
- Oh, baby...
- Mmm?

1290
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:54,299
Did you make it?

1291
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,218
Well, I didn't make it,
but I got us a song.

1292
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:01,214
You know, like our song
that will just be for you and me.

1293
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:07,270
Because everybody's got songs, but
they're lame and they all share them.

1294
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,188
You know, it's disgusting.

1295
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:12,650
- Not us. We have our own song.
- We have our own song.

1296
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:16,146
- What is it?
- Do you wanna listen to it?

1297
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:24,575
[♪ Penny & the Quarters: You and Me]

1298
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,706
[Dean] OK, turn it up.

1299
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:33,418
- Stop it.
- Take it easy.

1300
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,211
Listen.

1301
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:56,023
[Dean starts singing along]

1302
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:05,968
Baby! Hi!

1303
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:10,013
Look at you.

1304
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:12,303
[sighs]

1305
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:19,151
[Dean] Oh...

1306

[grunts]

1307
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:23,235
Hi.

1308
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:27,280
- Are you OK?
- I don't want to talk to you.

1309
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,579
I can't play right now, OK?

1310
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,208
What's going on, Dean?

1311
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,168
[Dean sighs]

1312
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,345
Dean, leave her alone.

1313
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:53,386
Hey! You can't lock me
out of my own house!

1314
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:57,266
I don't have my oxygen out here! Hey!

1315
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,261
You know, it's not just us.

1316
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,638
We got a little girl
we gotta think about.

1317
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,734
[Cindy] I know, I am thinking about her.

1318
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:48,983
I can't do this anymore.

1319
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:57,747
[Dean] Baby, you're just thinking
about yourself. What about Frankie?

1320
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:02,418
You want her to grow up
in a broken home?

1321
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:07,586
- Is that what you want?
- I am thinking about Frankie.

1322
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:09,594
[Dean] You're not
thinking about Frankie.

1323
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:11,885
- I am thinking about...
- No, you're not.

1324
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:18,475
Is this how you want her to grow up?

1325
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,685
[Cindy] I don't want her
to grow up in a home

1326
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:23,234
where her parents
treat each other like this.

1327
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,609
