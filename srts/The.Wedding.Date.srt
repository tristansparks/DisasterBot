1
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,159
<i>Hi, this is Kat.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

2
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,199
<i>Hi, Kat. This is Nick Mercer.</i>

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,259
<i>Sorry I didn't get back to you last night
but I got your messages.</i>

4
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,000
<i>All seven of them.</i>

5
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,780
<i>I know you're nervous, Kat,
but this is what I get paid for.</i>

6
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,440
<i>I'm running late so
I sent a messenger to pick up my ticket.</i>

7
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,799
<i>Kat, stop worrying.</i>

8
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,399
<i>Your ex-fiancÅEwill wish he never left you ...</i>

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,219
<i>... and your family will think we're in love.</i>

10
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,840
<i>Trust me. I'll see you at the airport.
Can't wait to meet you.'</i>

11
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,940
So sorry. I wasn't quite ready.

12
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,060
It's a plane ticket.

13
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,280
For a date. My date.

14
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,739
For my sister's wedding, in London.

15
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,540
You need to let go.

16
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,780
You're gonna have to help me.

17
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,600
'... 356 to London Heathrow,

18
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,500
'all remaining passengers
please make your way... '

19
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,679
Harry, I'm not working,
I'm going to my sister's wedding.

20
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,179
Customer service
will have to survive without me.

21
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,999
But Kat, we've had three delays
and two reps call in sick.

22
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,359
And a 2505 on the 8:20 CPT to LGW.

23
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,842
And there's this guy on line two

24
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:40,659
who gut stuck with in-laws because
we couldn't get him out of Heathrow.

25
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,559
I'd love to help you, sincerely,
but I haven't seen my family in two years

26
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,439
and my flight leaves in 15 minutes.

27
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,520
Come on, Kat. Please, I'm begging you.

28
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,559
Bump the 14:14 to the upper on 16:10.

29
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,900
What about line two?

30
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,700
Check my bags.

31
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,519
I understand, you want your family
to see you the way you see yourself,

32
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,419
or would, if you didn't feel
so victimized by them.

33
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,340
Hello!

34
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,080
We regret that you were inconvenienced.
Unfortunately, we are not liable.

35
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,019
But just this once I'll refund your ticket
and credit you 10,000 frequent flyer miles.

36
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,440
Thank you for calling Virgin Atlantic.

37
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,720
Your first trip?

38
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,019
My sister's getting married
and the best man is my ex.

39
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,800
If I chicken out,
I wanna know where the exits are.

40
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,179
I'm not a knuckler, I fly all the time.

41
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,619
The reason I can't feel my legs

42
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,059
is that any second
my date is gonna sit down in 3B

43
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,980
and I need him to look really good today.

44
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,140
Hello, 3B.

45
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,100
Thank you.

46
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Hey.

47
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Kat.

48
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,340
Let's sit.

49
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,359
I'm glad you found it OK.

50
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,260
The airport... The plane, I mean.

51
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,700
I'm sorry we couldn't leave sooner. I know you
wanted to get settled before the party.

52
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,840
Work must be crazy.

53
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,959
Oh, I should warn you.

54
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,419
You know those families
where everyone's out of their mind

55
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,180
but they're your family so you love them?

56
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Mine's not like that.

57
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,900
I love my dad.

58
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,719
But since he's my stepdad,
he's technically not family.

59
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,060
He's more like a hostage.

60
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,719
'Ladies and gentlemen,

61
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,360
'we will shortly be arriving
at London Heathrow.

62
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,219
'On arrival, please remain seated

63
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,980
'until the seat belt sign
has been switched off.

64
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,020
'Local time is 4:22pm

65
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,399
'and the temperature is a warm 21... '

66
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,279
Good morning.

67
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,940
'That's 72 degrees Fahrenheit.

68
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,199
'We would like to thank you
for flying with us today

69
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,560
'and look forward to seeing you again soon.'

70
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,540
Oh.

71
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,380
Nick, please tell me
you're not wearing that tonight.

72
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,620
I am.

73
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,219
It's no big deal really, it just looks like
a tailor made your tie out of my dress.

74
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,480
Don't get me wrong - matching's fine.
It's matchy-matchy you wanna look out for.

75
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,059
- We look like we're trying too hard.
- Exactly.

76
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,620
I want us to look like we fit
but not like we're trying to look like we fit.

77
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,459
Let me teach you a trick.

78
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,420
If you look people in the eye,
they'll never notice what you're wearing.

79
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,319
There's no way I'm showing up
in his and her outfits

80
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,260
so if you're gonna wear that tie,
I have to change my dress.

81
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,820
Driver, will you please
pull over somewhere?

82
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry. I promise next is the last one.

83
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,519
You must think...
Who knows what you think?

84
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,199
I know how important this is for you.

85
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
But remember, you're a beautiful woman
and you've got everything going for you.

86
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,180
Don't patronize me.

87
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,980
I feel like crap but I wanna look hot doing it.

88
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,060
Mission accomplished.

89
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,540
Really?

90
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,380
Don't get too attached.

91
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,680
I prefer the red one.

92
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,300
I'll let her know.

93
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,759
Hmm...

94
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,559
"Hmm, nice dress," or "Hmm...

95
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,420
"Gorgeous. I was insane to let you go"?

96
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,220
Well, I'd shag you.

97
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,240
If that's all right with you?

98
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,619
I don't know if I can do this.

99
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,540
Well, you can never be sure of anything
but we still have to go inside.

100
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,680
- Aunt Bea!
- Dear girl.

101
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,879
This should have been you getting married.

102
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,519
You know, you didn't have
to return the gravy boat.

103
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,019
And to think Jeffrey is the best man.

104
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,979
Have you met Nick?

105
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,480
- How do you do?
- Oh.

106
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,180
Charming.

107
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,760
And what do you do?

108
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,740
Excuse us.

109
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,520
What a nightmare.

110
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,839
OK, we need a story.

111
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,020
You're a therapist, we just started dating and
you're crazy about me.

112
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,339
Count it. 6,000 even.

113
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,720
- Oh, I trust you.
- No. Count it.

114
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,780
All right.

115
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,059
I'll cover expenses but if you want
to be intimate, we talk money first.

116
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,520
That won't be an issue. I find the idea
of sex for money morally repugnant.

117
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,340
I'm sorry. No offense.

118
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,159
Do me a favor, quit apologizing.

119
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,419
If you look at this as a business transaction,

120
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,379
maybe you won't
feel compelled to keep saying sorry.

121
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,939
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,580
It's also really annoying.

123
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,919
Sorry.

124
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,259
- Sorry.
- Pussy Kat! What happened to you?

125
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,880
- Pull over for a quickie?
- Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.

126
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,999
And who might this be?

127
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,359
Hi. I'm the new guy.
It's great to meet you.

128
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,079
Lovely. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

129
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,118
We've got welcome cocktails today

130
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,319
then tomorrow's Young People In The Park
and Stags And Hens.

131
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,459
Friday's the picnic, then the rehearsal dinner
and since you have left no margin for jetlag,

132
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,180
I need you to hydrate.

133
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,200
- Dad.
- My darling.

134
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,379
- Meet Nick.
- Professor Ellis.

135
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,200
- How do you do?
- Kat?

136
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,319
- Kat! Oooh! I'm getting married! Oh, Kitty!
- Hey!

137
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,319
Oh, I missed you so much.

138
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,579
Gosh, who's the hunky, huh? Nice.

139
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,480
There you are! Get over here!

140
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,259
At times like these,
I find a good, stiff drink helps.

141
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,160
- Can I get you a refill, sir?
- Very kind of you.

142
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,919
Where did you find him?

143
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,580
Thank you.

144
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,140
Yellow Pages.

145
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,960
- Hello!

146
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,299
Sweet Jesus.
Who gave that woman an amp?

147
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,839
Hello. Hello?

148
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,239
Oh. Wonderful. It's finally working.

149
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,180
Does everybody have a drink?
Because I am going to say a few words.

150
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,140
Welcome, friends and family...

151
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,319
- I'm...

152
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,160
Victor and I are so happy

153
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,659
that you're here to celebrate with us

154
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,099
as we welcome Edward and
the Fletcher-Wootens into our family.

155
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,440
We always thought that
we would marry off Kat first.

156
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,519
We had good reason to hope because
she was so popular with the boys at school

157
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,419
and we came pretty close once,

158
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,120
but, as you all know,
that crashed and burned.

159
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,919
Luckily, we were able
to get the deposit back,

160
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,220
- so here we are again...

161
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,000
To the bride and groom.

162
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,960
Oh. Yes. Yes. Well, back
to the bride and groom to be.

163
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,440
Um...

164
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,919
Edward, we are so glad that
you fell in love with the girl next door.

165
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,799
Our Amy. Congratulations, babies.

166
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,180
- Congratulations.

167
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,999
Jeffrey.

168
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,420
Hello. Kat-mandu.

169
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,500
Wow, you look gorgeous.

170
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,959
Gorgeous.

171
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,359
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

172
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,239
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God,  Top Kat! Ooooh!

173
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,579
Where the bloody hell have you been?
I have gynecologists that call more often.

174
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,620
- You have more than one?
- I play them off against each other.

175
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,359
Hello, arsehole. Listen,
Since you dumped my cousin brutally,

176
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,999
you won't mind if I steal her away, will you?

177
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,940
Thanks.

178
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,059
- You didn't have to do that.
- I wasn't saving you from him,

179
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,999
I was saving you from yourself.

180
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,260
You, my love, are too bloody nice.

181
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,280
I've never seen so many
beautiful women in one room.

182
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,619
By the way, Did he bring a date?

183
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,319
Darling, why waste time on that horse's arse

184
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,859
when Mr. Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down
is waiting for you over there?

185
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,239
- What does he do?
- He's a therapist.

186
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,980
- The perils of paranoia.
- Yes.

187
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,720
Oh, God. I think I've just come.

188
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,039
Thank you.

189
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,380
Can I have that?

190
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,380
Thank you.

191
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,199
You know what I love about all this, Kat?

192
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,479
There's finally a reason for
the world to revolve around you?

193
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,240
Exactly.

194
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,819
- There you are.
- How's the future missus?

195
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,220
I'm perfect, I'm all ginny.

196
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,060
Snufflepop.

197
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,479
Am I not the luckiest bastard on earth?

198
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,740
Aw! Well, I'll dance to that.

199
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,979
You know,That's what he gets
for not taking dance lessons

200
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,239
until two days before the wedding.

201
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,320
Come on Who's ever heard of
dance lessons for a wedding?

202
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,899
Just about everyone.

203
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,009
You are taking the piss?

204
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,119
We'll go with you.

205
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,759
I don't even know you, hunky dunky,
and I love you already.

206
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,580
Dance lessons? Hm. Right.

207
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,980
- Hey.
- Oh. Hello.

208
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,180
Weddings are a celebration
of love and commitment...

209
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,239
in Utopia.

210
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,519
In the real world they're an excuse to drink
excessively and say things you shouldn't.

211
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,019
- A philosopher, huh?
- Well, shrink.

212
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,359
- Crikey!
- What?

213
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,059
- No, nothing.
- No, tell me.

214
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,699
Well, you Yanks and your therapy,

215
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,200
it's a load of touchy-feely mumbo jumbo.

216
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,640
Spilling your guts to a total stranger,
it's not natural.

217
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,180
Oh, God.

218
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,119
It's just...

219
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,359
There's this girl that I care for...
Well, I suppose you could say I love her.

220
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,340
The bugger is,
she's here with some other guy.

221
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,020
There you are.

222
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,759
Hey, Kat. Hey, Kat.

223
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,560
Oh, hey, yourself. I see you met my ex.

224
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,180
- I was just telling him how we met.
- Mm.

225
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,539
- The Knicks game.
- Oh, yes.

226
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,819
Yeah... Oh.

227
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,619
You hate sport.

228
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,000
- I hate cricket.
- Right, yes.

229
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,520
Well, I should go and... go.

230
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,179
He looks miserable.

231
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,659
- What were you talking about?
- He seems a little drunk

232
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,420
but I think he's still crazy about you.

233
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,440
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- No.

234
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,200
What did he say? You don't...

235
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,320
You don't think he wants me back?

236
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,760
Are you OK?

237
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,479
- Here we are.
- Thank God!

238
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,360
- Oh!
- Thanks, Mom.

239
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,039
- There you are, darling.
- Thanks, Dad.

240
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,700
God!

241
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,759
- Thanks again for having me.
- Don't be silly. It's wonderful to meet you.

242
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,259
Although technically,
I never knew you existed.

243
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,020
- Come on, Bunny.
- I love surprises.

244
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
Where's Nick sleeping?

245
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,699
My mother has this rule about sharing
when there's no ring involved...

246
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,839
- Don't be silly.
- What!?

247
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,220
I am not as small-town
as my daughter seems to think.

248
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,559
Sorry about this.

249
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,200
I went through a painfully
earnest floral phase.

250
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,960
Air Supply?

251
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,780
Oh. My parents had a German
exchange student a few years back.

252
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,400
He must have left it here.

253
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,399
Everyone knows their greatest hits.

254
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,580
Some of their lesser-known ballads
are surprisingly poignant.

255
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,540
Is that an old habit from ballet class
or from a lifetime of walking on eggshells?

256
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,140
I never took ballet.

257
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,760
How'd you know that was me?

258
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,500
I have a friend at the magazine.

259
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,820
So much for anonymity.

260
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,040
Go ahead, take a look.
It's part of the package.

261
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,860
I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.

262
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,959
I never thought anything like this
could happen to me.

263
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,160
This happened to you?

264
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,579
It happened in the sense that
I picked up the phone, tracked you down,

265
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,880
flew you over her and gave you $6,000.

266
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,680
- Will you grab my shampoo, please?
- Shampoo! Got it.

267
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,619
<i>I'm all out love,
I'm so lost without you</i>

268
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,619
<i>I know you were right,
believing for so long</i>

269
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,299
<i>I'm all out of love,
what am I without you?</i>

270
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:03,980
<i>I can't be too late
to say that I was so wrong</i>

271
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,520
The part where you were
a sexual surrogate and then started to...

272
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,599
branch out, is...

273
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,559
Is that really how it happened?

274
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,399
The real story -
my mother was a hippie, and a stripper.

275
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,279
She was insanely inappropriate with me,

276
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,979
she washed her lingerie
in my bath water while I was still in it.

277
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,159
Oh....oh

278
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,199
So as an adult, I needed to find ways
to experience intimacy and sex

279
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,460
- but with rules that couldn't be violated.
- Wow.

280
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,700
I'm just screwing with you.

281
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,760
You shit.

282
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,440
OK, this part.

283
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,000
You say, and I quote,

284
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,539
"Every woman has
the exact love life she wants."

285
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,720
That seems a broad generalization... Oh!

286
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,659
Do you honestly believe that
I want to be single and miserable?

287
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,959
Do you think that I want to be hung up
on some guy who led me on for years

288
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,379
and out of the blue shattered my heart?

289
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,459
First of all, there's no such thing
as out of the blue.

290
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,680
And second of all, yeah.

291
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,079
- What?
- When you're ready to let go,

292
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,179
to be un-single and un-miserable,

293
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,239
you will.

294
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,420
Till then...

295
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,519
So when you were talking to Jeffrey before,

296
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,719
how did he sound?

297
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,039
Like a harmless, self-absorbed toolbox.

298
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,820
Seriously.

299
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,280
He sounded tormented.

300
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:55,454
Tormented? How?

301
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:57,215
Like he's...

302
00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:01,280
jealous that I'm here
with someone else, or like...

303
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,014
he regrets throwing away
our life together?

304
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:16,810
It's just that...

305
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:20,902
this hasn't really turned out
the way that I thought it would.

306
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:29,747
Hey, Nick.

307
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,621
Oh-oh-oh!

308
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,490
He seems more mature.

309
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:49,530
Run, you fat tart! Come on.

310
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:59,754
Come on, throw it. Throw it!

311
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:05,853
- Well played, darling.
- Ed!

312
00:27:05,854 --> 00:27:07,115
What?

313
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:11,534
- Are you ready, TJ?
- Bugger off.

314
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:19,205
All right, batter, batter.

315
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:36,589
- Move back.
- Yeah.

316
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:43,898
Come on, Kat.

317
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:46,138
Hurry up

318
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,785
 You're up, Kat.

319
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:51,799
Go, Kat.

320
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,958
Be nice to me, Jeffrey.

321
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:07,512
- Out!
- Yes!

322
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,079
Lose the game.

323
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,104
No!

324
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:28,121
- Come on!
- Edward.

325
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,057
Come on!

326
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:35,930
Come on, you sexy little monkey. Come on!

327
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:40,777
- You're supposed to be helping.
- Oh, trust me. I am.

328
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:12,192
- What's with the socks?
- It's a golf-themed bachelorette.

329
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:13,996
Have you ever done a wedding before?

330
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:15,715
No, but I have done funerals.

331
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:18,504
An escort at a funeral? Someone's dead.

332
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:20,673
Yeah, imagine facing that alone.

333
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:22,757
Ah. Catch.

334
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,856
Make sure he stays on
the right side of the road.

335
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:30,328
- Which is, of course, the left.
- That's right.

336
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:35,076
So, are you ever attracted
to your clients?

337
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,165
I know you're curious about my business
but I really can't discuss other clients.

338
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:43,705
Come on! How many of them
want to sleep with you?

339
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:48,295
You know, I swear it's not about the sex.

340
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:51,236
It's about understanding what people need.

341
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:54,823
Please! You're like the Yoda of escorts.

342
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:57,828
Getting you on the phone
was harder than getting into college.

343
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:01,429
- No, I don't play games. No gimmicks.
- Mm-hm.

344
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,510
It's much more...

345
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:06,433
Subtle?

346
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:10,932
It's not about me.

347
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,325
It's about you.

348
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:16,224
Show me.

349
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:21,848
Come on.

350
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,433
Hmm... What's holding me back?

351
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,769
I think it's the words "morally repugnant".

352
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,470
Show me.

353
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:40,177
Close your eyes.

354
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,281
Close your eyes.

355
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,299
Close your eyes.

356
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:59,322
You're safe, you can relax.

357
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:04,193
I'm not gonna kiss you.

358
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:09,960
He's gonna be so sorry he lost you.

359
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:14,934
So, stop worrying.

360
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:17,542
Forget the past.

361
00:31:18,314 --> 00:31:20,346
Forget the pain.

362
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,717
And remember...

363
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:28,400
what an incredible woman you are.

364
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:33,318
If you do that,

365
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:36,137
he'll realize what he lost.

366
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,110
Holy crap!

367
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:46,491
You're worth every penny.

368
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,497
- You should get going.
- Mm-hm.

369
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:57,442
OK, Yoda.

370
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,902
- To Amy!

371
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,063
I thought you might need this.

372
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,157
Silly me. Where was my head?

373
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:31,562
- Bye.
- Listen, why don't you stay

374
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:34,542
- and have a little fiery drink with us, eh?
- Uh...

375
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:36,233
- It's fine.
- Come on.

376
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:38,103
You know you want to!

377
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:41,127
- Oh, I can see why.
- You're lovely.

378
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:43,427
Isn't he lovely? Have you smelt him?

379
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,444
He smells lovely!

380
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:47,975
Can you believe Kat gets to shag this guy?

381
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:52,643
No, really, you should send God
a bottle of wine or a quiche or something.

382
00:32:57,763 --> 00:33:01,271
Look at those buns. Fresh from the bakery.

383
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:05,304
It must feel great getting paid
just for being you.

384
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:07,806
- Who says I'm being me?
- Excuse me.

385
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:11,523
Amy, thank you for granting me
a rare glimpse into a timeless female ritual.

386
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:15,640
Here's to the husbands who've won you,
the losers who've lost you

387
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:18,625
and the lucky bastards
who've yet to meet you.

388
00:33:19,421 --> 00:33:21,933
And to the cock in the henhouse.

389
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:55,424
I can't believe you found him first.
I am so depressed.

390
00:33:55,552 --> 00:33:59,615
Will somebody buy my hoo-hah a drink?

391
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:06,148
You remember when we took
the girls hiking in the Lake District?

392
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:07,294
- No.
- You do!

393
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,632
Blistering heat in the morning,
rained all afternoon.

394
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:11,372
No.

395
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:14,908
You backed your car
over a copper's bicycle.

396
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,662
- Sorry, no.
- The Rat And Gherkin.

397
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:19,803
- Splendid local scrumpy.
- Mm.

398
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,684
Amy wore that little bikini thing.

399
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,480
But somehow it was Kat
that got stung by nettles.

400
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:28,088
Kat never said a word until
Amy caught her scratching her arse.

401
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:32,438
Then you rubbed it with a dock leaf
to bring down the swelling.

402
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:35,792
Yeah, I remember it.

403
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:38,692
I didn't deserve her back then.

404
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,310
And you do now?

405
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:50,786
What is his problem?

406
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:55,771
- What?
- There's something about him I don't like.

407
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:58,849
He's less than 90 per cent body fat
and he's shagging your ex.

408
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,386
No, that is not it. Look at him,

409
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:05,715
he's walking around all American,
like he owns the place.

410
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:14,997
Oh, no!

411
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:18,192
Come on, this is your last chance.

412
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:42,167
Woody?

413
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:47,305
- Not yet, but it's getting there!
- It's getting there!

414
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:51,820
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

415
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:57,102
I thought you were in San Francisco,
or was it Nepal?

416
00:35:57,103 --> 00:36:00,895
Close. Sydney.
But it turns out that I missed the rain.

417
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,509
Did Kat tell you that she dumped you because
of your funky breath?

418
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,245
She's drunk.

419
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:11,750
But I didn't... I didn't really dump you. Right?

420
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:17,511
Hard. But it was understandable,
you were one of the hottest girls in school.

421
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:20,659
And we know that Kat was
one of the hottest expats in school

422
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,424
because she was voted
Best Eyes and Brightest Smile

423
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:27,304
and the Most Likely To Age Well.

424
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:34,919
You're my half-sister but I whole love you.

425
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:45,100
How about you get
my half-sister a Seventh Hole?

426
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:48,289
- Tequila. Tequila.
- Sure.

427
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:57,660
Are you all right?

428
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:01,803
I don't know if I can do this.

429
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,317
The Seventh Hole?

430
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:06,195
No! The wedding.

431
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:11,258
I shouldn't be allowed to get married.
I shouldn't

432
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:13,485
What are you talking about?

433
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:18,406
TJ!

434
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:24,645
Come on! Come on!

435
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:33,088
What's wrong with Jeffrey?
As if I would sleep with a stripper!

436
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,858
I'm about to get married. You have to...

437
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:43,907
It's been my experience that
a man in love doesn't want a prostitute.

438
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:47,662
Eddie, you did the right thing.

439
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:59,780
How do you know so much...

440
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:04,213
about so much?

441
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:07,962
I'm a hooker.

442
00:38:18,957 --> 00:38:20,814
I like that.

443
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:10,565
I just don't feel very well.
I'm gonna go. Give us a kiss.

444
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:15,112
- Ladies...
- How much do you rock, TJ?

445
00:39:15,113 --> 00:39:18,523
...that was a top night.

446
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:20,186
Top night!

447
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,508
She's getting married!

448
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:47,273
Are you OK?

449
00:43:22,591 --> 00:43:25,638
- Morning.
- Morning.

450
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:45,281
Ahoy, there!

451
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:50,685
Hi, Dad.

452
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:22,116
I don't know what works for you
but I brought you some black coffee

453
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:26,392
and some stale crackers, egg and cheese
sandwich and a Bloody Mary.

454
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:30,542
That's very sweet of you.
But I need to ask you something.

455
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:36,265
What happened last night?

456
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:42,838
Nothing.

457
00:44:58,306 --> 00:44:59,800
Thanks.

458
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:18,772
- Is this for last night?
- No! How could it be? Nothing happened.

459
00:45:18,773 --> 00:45:22,347
If I was gonna charge you,
I said I'd tell you first.

460
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:26,800
I didn't want you to think that
I was expecting anything for free

461
00:45:26,801 --> 00:45:29,596
or that I was expecting anything at all.

462
00:45:29,597 --> 00:45:32,556
I mean, obviously
I was expecting something

463
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:35,888
or else I wouldn't have stopped at that ATM.

464
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:38,910
Just so you know, you're 300 short.

465
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:45,720
Wait, you're telling me that
if something happened last night,

466
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:47,818
I'd have to pay you $1,700?

467
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:50,111
That's a down payment on a Ford Focus.

468
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:51,673
Not dollars, pounds.

469
00:45:51,674 --> 00:45:54,261
Besides, it includes, you know...

470
00:45:54,287 --> 00:45:56,485
That's the extra 300.

471
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:01,665
Are you a boatsman, son?

472
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,997
I am now, sir.

473
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:07,181
I'm glad someone's
making use of her at last.

474
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:09,510
The boat, I mean.

475
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:13,199
"To defile." Four letters.

476
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,230
- Good morning, Daddy.
- Ah.

477
00:46:18,182 --> 00:46:22,031
- What if I didn't want you to do that to me?
- The 300's for you doing it to me.

478
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:25,822
If anything had happened, it would have
been one of the highlights, for you.

479
00:46:25,873 --> 00:46:29,965
- But nothing did.
- That's why you get to keep your money.

480
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:32,780
The wedding dance is

481
00:46:32,781 --> 00:46:37,345
the most important dance moment
in a person's life.

482
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:41,318
A room full of friends and family,

483
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:44,123
watching, smiling,

484
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:46,908
betting on how long the marriage will last.

485
00:46:47,612 --> 00:46:50,354
All you'll have is each other

486
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:53,104
and whatever skills you acquire today.

487
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,638
And pair off.

488
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,905
Now, your left foot. Her right foot.

489
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,966
Good. And we'll try to glide across the floor.

490
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,726
Come a little bit closer together. Moving.

491
00:47:16,451 --> 00:47:18,261
Trying to turn.

492
00:47:18,946 --> 00:47:20,734
What's the matter, Nick?

493
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:22,480
Two left feet?

494
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:25,426
Oh!

495
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,051
When I told you
I'd never done a wedding before,

496
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:34,409
it wasn't because I'd never been asked.

497
00:48:36,098 --> 00:48:37,752
I'd just never said yes.

498
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,550
Why'd you say yes to me?

499
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:46,406
There was something in your voice
on the phone that day.

500
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:50,088
Desperation?

501
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,767
I think it was hope.

502
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,334
Get a move on, you lovebirds.
I'm getting married in the morning.

503
00:49:25,238 --> 00:49:28,558
- Ah, hello, Bambi.
- Darling, please don't do that.

504
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,319
Oh, wow.

505
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:40,446
That's a big bed.

506
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:57,185
You know what pisses me off?

507
00:49:57,617 --> 00:50:01,316
I've been spilling my guts all weekend
and I don't know anything about you.

508
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,173
I'm allergic to fabric softener.

509
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:10,903
I'm majoring in comparative literature
at Brown. I hate anchovies.

510
00:50:12,848 --> 00:50:15,505
I think I'd miss you
even if we'd never met.

511
00:50:30,412 --> 00:50:33,679
I'm a little concerned...
I'm just... It makes me nervous...

512
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,182
You know, I might just call you.

513
00:50:37,229 --> 00:50:40,844
But if I did, I would lose,
because my hand is complete shite.

514
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:42,497
Ohhh.

515
00:50:44,784 --> 00:50:45,988
- I'm in.
- Come on.

516
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:48,060
There's gotta be something wrong with him.

517
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:51,189
I bet his thingy bends, doesn't it?
Got a little kink in it.

518
00:50:51,732 --> 00:50:55,213
Oh, no, don't tell me.
It's bloody perfect.

519
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,911
I'm going to see you.

520
00:50:59,837 --> 00:51:02,140
And Looky, looky here.

521
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,194
A full house.

522
00:51:04,914 --> 00:51:06,336
Oh-ho-ho!

523
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:10,123
Has anyone seen my future wife?
She'll kill me if I don't serve her first.

524
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:13,846
Have you guys ever had
a real honest-to-God fight, ever?

525
00:51:13,901 --> 00:51:16,310
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah, right.

526
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:20,073
Well, apparently,
makeup sex is the best kind.

527
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,743
Not that I'm ever going to find out.

528
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:26,927
- Give me that!

529
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:29,883
- Come on!
- No, no!

530
00:51:29,913 --> 00:51:33,281
- Don't!
- Come on!

531
00:51:33,398 --> 00:51:35,769
You seem to have a way with women.

532
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:40,674
Why don't you go and rustle up the bride?
Get her to join the party.

533
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:47,406
Why are you bringing this up now?
I love Ed.

534
00:51:47,453 --> 00:51:50,341
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to tell me...

535
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:57,900
Blue shirt or... white shirt
for the, er, rehearsal dinner?

536
00:52:03,025 --> 00:52:04,611
Sorry to interrupt.

537
00:52:05,866 --> 00:52:07,467
Your dad sent me.

538
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:09,821
What for?

539
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,017
To make sure you're OK.

540
00:52:18,149 --> 00:52:20,467
Kat, could I have a word?
It'll only take a moment.

541
00:52:20,468 --> 00:52:24,708
Let me think. You stole seven years of
her life with your bullshit and your charm

542
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:26,644
and now you'd like just a moment?

543
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:29,505
Sure. Go right ahead.

544
00:52:33,537 --> 00:52:37,633
Thanks for the solidarity, Mum,
but next time a little less information.

545
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:41,475
Do you believe a place has a memory?

546
00:52:41,496 --> 00:52:45,450
Even before Ed and I started dating,
we all used to

547
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,413
come up here in the summer and spend weekends.

548
00:52:57,857 --> 00:53:00,896
God, I hope it doesn't remember everything.

549
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:05,196
No matter how certain
one is of one's position

550
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:06,641
of what one should or shouldn't do,

551
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,101
one sometimes discovers

552
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:14,024
that one is not as one would have
hoped one would have been.

553
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:17,353
- What exactly are you trying to say?
- I'm sorry.

554
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,353
Look, I feel like I need to tell you something.

555
00:53:21,077 --> 00:53:24,969
- You're not even listening.
- I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute.

556
00:53:31,516 --> 00:53:35,137
Hey, is everything OK?

557
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,381
Yeah.

558
00:53:41,813 --> 00:53:43,349
Yeah.

559
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:50,081
Anchovy, Nick?

560
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:52,416
I remember the day I met Kat.

561
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:54,457
It was in New York.

562
00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:56,577
I'd been seeing Bunny for a few months

563
00:53:56,578 --> 00:54:00,626
and she finally trusted me
enough to meet her kid.

564
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:07,935
So I'm over at her place
and in walks this little monster.

565
00:54:08,533 --> 00:54:11,254
That was it. I was a goner.

566
00:54:11,942 --> 00:54:14,410
That was the day I became a dad.

567
00:54:14,861 --> 00:54:19,236
You know, Nick, you think it's going
to get easier as they get older,

568
00:54:19,268 --> 00:54:22,419
that you're going to worry about them less.

569
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:25,767
Or that you're going to trust the world more.

570
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:29,847
But that's just not how it happens.

571
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:43,801
This may not make much sense to you, sir,

572
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:47,565
but I'd like to ask your permission
to date your daughter.

573
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:52,378
I thought you already were.

574
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:11,994
- I blame... I blame Tony Peepants.
- No.

575
00:55:11,995 --> 00:55:14,348
Let's have the story. Kat, come on.

576
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:17,406
- No.
- I have to initiate Nick into our family.

577
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:22,708
I blame Tony for why my two girls
just don't seem to be able to get along.

578
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:26,437
Don't deny it. You barely tolerate each other.

579
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:31,529
Come on. It's true. The only thing you've got in
common is you're both attracted to me.

580
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:32,676
It started after we moved here.

581
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:37,683
My two girls got into a fight over Tony
Peepants and have never made up since.

582
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:39,942
Apparently, Kat and I were inseparable.

583
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:42,636
If Kat ate a banana, Amy threw it up.

584
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:45,093
If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.

585
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:50,448
So we were eating
and throwing up together in harmony

586
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:52,609
until Tony walked me home
from school one day.

587
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,404
He was my first boyfriend.

588
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:57,557
Tony ignored Kat
because he wanted to play with me.

589
00:55:57,558 --> 00:56:01,174
Anyway, the point of the story is that
Tony ended up with a chair in his face.

590
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:04,231
It was plastic and child-sized.

591
00:56:04,817 --> 00:56:10,378
- As I recall, there were stitches involved.
- Come on, Bunny, 15 stitches.

592
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:12,527
So is that when he peed in his pants?

593
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,874
He cried a lot,
but there was no peeing.

594
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,621
So what's with the nickname?

595
00:56:22,182 --> 00:56:25,197
I have absolutely no idea.

596
00:56:27,193 --> 00:56:29,307
Let me get some more wine.

597
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:32,636
Would you marry me if I asked?

598
00:56:32,637 --> 00:56:34,809
That was a yes. Did you see that?

599
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:49,425
And you know, I thought perhaps you...
Bollocks. Sorry.

600
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:54,526
I had no idea this would be so difficult.
I just feel like I owe you an explanation.

601
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,358
Relax, relax. It's fine.

602
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,011
I promise.

603
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:06,977
And I should probably admit that...

604
00:57:08,649 --> 00:57:12,012
I brought Nick with me to torture you, slowly,

605
00:57:12,027 --> 00:57:14,112
for the entire weekend.

606
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:18,537
But then, I don't know,
something happened and now...

607
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:23,803
I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings
but I'm just sick of you and me.

608
00:57:23,804 --> 00:57:30,348
Of our whole story, so come on,
let's just go upstairs and eat some tiramisu.

609
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:35,273
I slept with your sister.

610
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:48,890
- I'm sorry?
- Well, I shagged Amy, two years ago.

611
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:51,345
That's why I broke it off with you.

612
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:56,686
And then after you left,
sod it, we kept at it like rabbits,

613
00:57:56,687 --> 00:58:02,599
until we both realized it was absolutely mad
and, obviously, morally wrong.

614
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,595
And then that was it.

615
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:11,878
But last Christmas, when Ed proposed,

616
00:58:12,373 --> 00:58:16,846
I realized... I'm in love with her.

617
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:24,430
Good Lord, say something, please.

618
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:41,935
Oh, my God, he's told you, hasn't he?

619
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,964
- You knew?
- Kat, I'm so sorry. I'm so...

620
00:58:55,678 --> 00:58:58,261
Kat. Kat, please.

621
00:58:58,262 --> 00:59:00,197
Kat, please don't say anything.

622
00:59:04,616 --> 00:59:06,646
I can't believe you told her.

623
00:59:37,362 --> 00:59:38,847
What's going on?

624
00:59:39,466 --> 00:59:40,985
Nothing.

625
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:44,953
It doesn't look like nothing.

626
00:59:45,657 --> 00:59:48,594
Now is not the time to catch on, Ed.

627
00:59:50,313 --> 00:59:53,454
OK. Good.

628
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:08,590
Leave me alone.
You knew and you didn't tell me.

629
01:00:08,591 --> 01:00:11,933
- Wait up.
- I can't believe I trusted you.

630
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,952
Come on. You've got to stop running.

631
01:00:13,953 --> 01:00:18,085
- How could you not have told me?
- What did you expect me to say?

632
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:20,383
You let me make a fool of myself.

633
01:00:20,922 --> 01:00:24,703
You lied to me, but I guess I shouldn't be
surprised because that's what you do.

634
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,809
That's who you are. You're a liar.

635
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:31,441
You're judging me? That's a good one.

636
01:00:31,536 --> 01:00:33,444
You're going to point a finger at me,

637
01:00:33,445 --> 01:00:36,467
the guy that you hired
to pretend to be your boyfriend?

638
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:41,723
You're right. I was so desperate
to make everyone believe that I was happy

639
01:00:41,724 --> 01:00:44,534
that I paid $6,000 for a lie.

640
01:00:44,617 --> 01:00:49,425
And, at the end of the day, the only one
who ended up falling for it was me.

641
01:00:49,932 --> 01:00:52,702
I wish I could say it was worth it.

642
01:00:53,444 --> 01:00:56,825
Go ahead, Kat, hate me.

643
01:00:56,844 --> 01:01:00,873
I think you're running out of steam
on this whole Jeffrey thing anyhow.

644
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:05,506
It maybe now you'll be able to hold on to this
long enough to ruin your next relationship.

645
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:22,437
- Nick.
- I'm just checking into a hotel.

646
01:01:22,438 --> 01:01:25,254
Don't be ridiculous. It's late.

647
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:27,652
Take the car.

648
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,823
Actually, the boathouse is empty.

649
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:43,423
Look, I don't know what's going on with
you two but I'm sure you'll work it out.

650
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:51,735
You couldn't be more perfect
if she'd picked you out of a catalog.

651
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:58,530
Thanks, Ed.

652
01:02:08,588 --> 01:02:10,067
Hey.

653
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:14,888
Hey.

654
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,729
I just... I wanted to say thank you
for not outing me in front of Ed.

655
01:02:26,115 --> 01:02:30,375
I want to tell him,
just not the night before our wedding.

656
01:02:30,376 --> 01:02:33,395
You know, with these things,
timing is everything.

657
01:02:42,516 --> 01:02:44,293
You're right.

658
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:47,346
You should time it right,

659
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:51,511
so that when he hears that
you repeatedly screwed his best friend,

660
01:02:52,177 --> 01:02:55,077
he won't feel like the world is collapsing
and there's no escape

661
01:02:55,078 --> 01:02:58,081
because you tricked him into marrying you.

662
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:08,116
- Kat...
- Don't worry. Your wedding will be perfect.

663
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:12,401
Tomorrow I'll say all the right things
and you'll deal with Ed when you're ready.

664
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:17,758
But right now, tonight,
I'm not going to pretend it's OK.

665
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,324
And that's your first flight out?

666
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,597
All right, thanks.

667
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:04,822
I'm OK.

668
01:04:09,363 --> 01:04:11,284
I don't believe you.

669
01:04:11,824 --> 01:04:14,376
I'm fine, really.

670
01:04:16,136 --> 01:04:20,748
Nothing a bottle of Jack
and a straight razor couldn't fix.

671
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:26,085
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

672
01:04:26,086 --> 01:04:28,118
It's Amy's day.

673
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,175
Get in the car, darling.

674
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:57,913
No, no. Smile.

675
01:05:21,771 --> 01:05:23,465
Hello.

676
01:05:26,446 --> 01:05:28,279
I've been looking for you.

677
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:36,524
So, why did you let him go?

678
01:05:41,506 --> 01:05:44,001
- It's complicated, Dad.
- Right.

679
01:05:44,002 --> 01:05:46,677
It probably wouldn't have
worked out anyway, huh?

680
01:05:51,466 --> 01:05:55,434
I remember reading a fascinating article
in the New York Times Magazine once,

681
01:05:55,913 --> 01:05:57,710
where this guy said,

682
01:05:58,273 --> 01:06:03,322
"Every woman has
the exact love life she wants."

683
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:07,305
You know what? I agree with him.

684
01:06:07,973 --> 01:06:11,938
But I refuse to believe
that this is what you want, Kat.

685
01:06:12,171 --> 01:06:14,533
Ever since you were little,

686
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:17,195
you've always worried
about what other people think.

687
01:06:18,818 --> 01:06:23,785
Now, come on. What do you think?
Is he the guy for you?

688
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,614
Then go and get him.

689
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:02,526
Hello, darling. Your mother said
you wanted to have a quick word.

690
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,528
No, no, no, I...

691
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,793
There's something
you should know before you marry me.

692
01:07:12,584 --> 01:07:14,462
What is it?

693
01:08:01,941 --> 01:08:04,371
I wanted to tell you
but I was afraid you'd never forgive me

694
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:07,870
and I just... I love you so much.

695
01:08:07,874 --> 01:08:09,510
I'm sorry.

696
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:15,971
I knew you were seeing someone else
when we finally got together, but not Jeffrey.

697
01:08:18,271 --> 01:08:20,978
Does Kat know?

698
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,253
Jeffrey told her last night.

699
01:08:28,931 --> 01:08:30,633
Excuse me.

700
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:39,704
Ed?

701
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:46,935
Ed... Calm down, Ed.

702
01:08:46,936 --> 01:08:48,536
Ed!

703
01:08:50,664 --> 01:08:52,448
TJ!

704
01:08:57,608 --> 01:08:59,235
Ah!

705
01:09:03,645 --> 01:09:07,118
Ed, calm down!
It's all sorted! She wants you!

706
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,145
I've given up! What's the problem?

707
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:12,054
You back-stabbing weasel!

708
01:09:12,055 --> 01:09:15,637
That's not fair.
It was before you guys were even dating.

709
01:09:15,638 --> 01:09:19,020
But you were engaged to her sister.

710
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,206
Ed, calm down!

711
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:26,289
We can talk about this
like civilized human beings.

712
01:09:32,804 --> 01:09:35,209
I look like a total wanker, don't I?

713
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,956
Yeah, kind of.

714
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:46,955
Get in the car, Ed.
He's halfway to France by now.

715
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:49,709
Whoa!

716
01:09:58,162 --> 01:10:01,579
I trust you've enjoyed
your trip to England.

717
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,411
Yeah, it was fantastic.
Thanks, Eddie.

718
01:10:07,254 --> 01:10:10,549
You know, I felt sorry
for you last night.

719
01:10:11,133 --> 01:10:15,338
I was just sitting there like some smug arse,
thinking, "Aren't I a lucky sod?"

720
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:22,746
I forgave her when I thought
it was just some random bloke.

721
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:26,939
But not Jeffrey.

722
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,777
I've had her up on a pedestal ever since...

723
01:10:36,096 --> 01:10:38,460
ever since I put her up there.

724
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:42,611
What a mess I've made, huh?

725
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:56,014
I'm so sorry.

726
01:11:03,031 --> 01:11:04,435
The hardest thing's loving someone

727
01:11:04,436 --> 01:11:08,577
and then having the courage
to let them love you back.

728
01:11:15,252 --> 01:11:17,124
But if you know her shit
and she knows yours

729
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:21,676
and at the end of the day,
you still would rather give up than try...

730
01:11:24,959 --> 01:11:27,446
nothing's ever gonna be worth it.

731
01:11:33,371 --> 01:11:35,517
Maybe think about it this way.

732
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,736
You go back,

733
01:11:39,026 --> 01:11:42,280
you get to spend the rest of your life
having really great makeup sex.

734
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:48,668
- Ed?
- Must run!

735
01:11:49,451 --> 01:11:51,153
Hi.

736
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:55,110
Hi.

737
01:11:57,252 --> 01:12:01,986
Last night, when we were fighting,
I thought this was over.

738
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:08,556
And I was going to leave you alone
and just take off but...

739
01:12:10,683 --> 01:12:17,610
Then I realized I'd rather fight with you
than make love with anyone else.

740
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:49,275
- I should get going.
- What? No, you can't.

741
01:12:49,276 --> 01:12:51,375
I have to.

742
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:53,338
I'm the best man.

743
01:13:49,743 --> 01:13:52,135
- Let's do it.

744
01:14:10,544 --> 01:14:14,620
Ed, there's no one in the world who knows

745
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:17,699
how to love my baby sister better than you.

746
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,801
Be good to one another.

747
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,358
To Amy and Ed.

748
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:24,284
Amy and Ed.

749
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:31,489
Thanks
