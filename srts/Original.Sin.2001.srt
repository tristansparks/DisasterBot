1
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:24,393
"You cannot walk away from love."

2
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:28,742
That was the advertisement
in a Baltimore newspaper.

3
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:32,651
And that is how he found her.

4
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:37,850
She was a young woman in need of a husband.

5
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:41,159
And he was a man who wanted a wife.

6
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:02,978
He's too late to talk sense to him now.

7
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:05,380
You can't marry her, Luis.
You've never met her.

8
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:08,433
I meet her today. The boat
from America comes at 6:00,

9
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:11,443
we marry at 9:00 by
10:00, I'm back at work.

10
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:14,022
Ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

11
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:16,971
A man needs a wife, isn't that
what you've been telling me?

12
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:19,694
- Well, I sent for one.
- From America.

13
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:21,253
What does she look like?

14
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:25,664
Comes a day in every man's
life when a band is

15
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:28,489
playing and he's the only
one who can hear it.

16
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,770
Today is your day.

17
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:32,732
I love you, woman.

18
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:34,962
She is not beautiful.

19
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,475
She is not meant to be beautiful...

20
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:40,807
She is meant to be kind, true and
young enough to bear children.

21
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:46,880
Go. Go on. The sun will be up any minute.
That boat will be coming in.

22
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:53,049
But what about love, Luis? Doesn't
love come into this equation at all?

23
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,317
Love is not for me, Alan.

24
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,022
Love is for those people who believe in it.

25
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:00,386
Let's go.

26
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:05,032
Why are you laughing at me? You've
been laughing at me the whole morning.

27
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,558
Never mind. You go! Go on!

28
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:27,936
No, this is not a love story.

29
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:33,469
But it is a story about love, and
the power it has over our life.

30
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:37,043
The power to heal or destroy.

31
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,978
And this is where the story begins.

32
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:06,296
Mr. Vargas?

33
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,763
Luis Vargas?

34
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,063
Yes.

35
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,933
You don't recognize me, do you?

36
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:19,181
Miss Russell?

37
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,577
Yes.

38
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:26,418
Julia Russell?

39
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,251
But this, this picture...

40
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:34,386
I've deceived you. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have. I...

41
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:36,733
I was unsure.

42
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:37,734
You see... I...

43
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:40,915
I didn't want to meant
to be interested in me

44
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:43,422
just because I owned a pretty face.
And...

45
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,803
So I sent another woman's
photograph and not my own.

46
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,007
I see.

47
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:56,239
I do hope you forgive me. I meant
to write many times. I tried.

48
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,972
But my courage failed me. So I...

49
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:06,886
And...

50
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,187
Well...

51
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:14,919
Now I stand before you as I
am, and you know the worst.

52
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:16,223
No, no.

53
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,889
Not the worst at all.

54
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:23,930
Only, not what I was expecting.

55
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:28,073
If my deception has altered
your intentions...

56
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:31,143
- If you're not satisfied in antway...
- No, no, no, no, it isn't that.

57
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:34,513
I am determined to make my way
back to my home in Delaware.

58
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:37,046
- If you say so, I will.
- Miss Russell...

59
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,915
Miss Russell...

60
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:45,519
you have been honest with me.

61
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,621
I will be honest with you, too.

62
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:53,028
I will admit to a deception of my own.

63
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,933
You are exactly the image
of your photograph.

64
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,528
Yes, yes, I am.

65
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:07,131
But I wrote to you that I am a clerk in
a coffee export house. I am not.

66
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,745
I... I own the house.

67
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,207
The business is my own.

68
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,187
You did not want a woman
to be interested in you...

69
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,753
just because you owned
a pretty bank account.

70
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,082
- Yes.
- Yes.

71
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:30,084
Well...

72
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:33,524
Then we have something in common.

73
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,927
We are both not to be trusted.

74
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,369
Of course, if my... if my deception
has altered your intentions...

75
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:52,674
if you are not interested in
marrying a wealthy man...

76
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:55,679
No, I think I could manage.

77
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,321
If you could manage a
somewhat prettier wife.

78
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,589
I'll make the effort.

79
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:22,235
Miss Russell.

80
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,473
Mr. Vargas.

81
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:30,210
Now we have all the time in the world
to get to know each other.

82
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:32,881
Well... No, not all the time.

83
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,181
No?

84
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,918
No, we are going to be married at 9:00.

85
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:42,954
- Well then we'd better hurry.
- Yes.

86
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,290
"Take this ring...

87
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,999
as a sign of my love...

88
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,538
and fidelity...

89
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,271
to you."

90
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:28,828
Music!

91
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:30,529
Music!

92
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,029
Music!

93
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:42,163
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

94
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,505
To our groom and his beautiful...

95
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,979
enchanting bride!

96
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,746
Will you dance with me?

97
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,384
Dance?

98
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:00,880
I... I don't dance.

99
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,021
I say you do.

100
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:12,532
May their life together be like
this dance, harmonious, smooth.

101
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:17,438
- Dance for life never ending and...
- Alan, enough is enough.

102
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:18,735
I'm almost through.

103
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:21,638
You're through now. Sit down.

104
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,847
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

105
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:47,778
Would you like to see the house?

106
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,661
- Oh, no. I can see it tomorrow.
- Yes

107
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:57,914
You have to give me a few moments.
I'm shy of these things.

108
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:03,588
I will give you as many moments,
days, nights as you need.

109
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,864
And when you want me to come to you...

110
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:09,833
I will.

111
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:12,367
Not before.

112
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:19,465
You would do that for me?

113
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,939
If you say so, yes.

114
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:31,383
Then...

115
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,874
I will say good night.

116
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,397
- Good night.
- Good night.

117
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,461
The room is there, to the right.

118
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,521
Yes. I think I'll find it.

119
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,025
Awake at last.

120
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:02,926
The day is half-gone.

121
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:07,299
I'm sorry. I'm not dressed.

122
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,468
I could wait outside, but then
the coffee would get cold.

123
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:12,038
No, it's all right.

124
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:16,143
If someone brought me my coffee
every morning before I dressed...

125
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:18,170
I would be very happy.

126
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,237
It would change the day.

127
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,440
But...

128
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,183
you only drink tea in the morning.

129
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,744
I do? No.

130
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:30,524
When I said in my letters that I worked in
a coffee company, you wrote back...

131
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:32,283
That was my sister.

132
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:37,687
She believed coffee to be a sinful pleasure
so I pretended to agree with her

133
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:42,327
and then she read all my letters to you,
I could not always tell the truth and...

134
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,762
All the more reason to forget them.
That's all behind you now.

135
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,103
What do you think?

136
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,569
About what?

137
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:02,111
Do you believe as my sister does...

138
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,184
that pleasure could ever be sinful?

139
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:07,096
Why did you choose an American wife?

140
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:08,767
Well...

141
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,271
Here, we are the past.

142
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:14,675
And there, you are the future.

143
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:20,608
Why did you choose to leave it?

144
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,379
To escape the future.

145
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:27,946
Well, to become someone else, I think.

146
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:33,859
I am someone else with you.

147
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:37,792
Someone more like...

148
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:39,964
myself.

149
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,412
And there, in his arms...

150
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,844
she became someone else.

151
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,513
Someone more like herself.

152
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:23,009
I'm telling you man,
I've never been happier.

153
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,052
There's no such thing as
happily married, Luis.

154
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:29,286
It's an oxymoron, like "happily dead".

155
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:33,927
I thought you'd be slowly finding your way
back to the whores by now.

156
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:36,625
- Seeing some little "Creole" time.
- Not anymore.

157
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:39,698
Anyway you've had her for
yourself long enough.

158
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,599
When do we get to see her again?

159
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,677
Well, we're going to
the theatre next week.

160
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,778
An American touring
company she wants to see.

161
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,099
Why don't you join us?

162
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:59,170
¶ Soon comes the morning
when the knell is rung... ¶

163
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,582
¶ to take my living breath. ¶

164
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,048
¶ Come, come, the night is almost done. ¶

165
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,148
¶ Satan is near! ¶

166
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,891
¶ The shrieking, grim and... ¶

167
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:16,458
¶ hideous brim of hell to uncover. ¶

168
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:19,529
¶ Come, or you will share
her wretched end. ¶

169
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:22,527
¶ Hellhound! Abominable monster! ¶

170
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,029
¶ Would that I had never been born! ¶

171
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:30,936
Wonderful. Wonderful.

172
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:33,008
Disgusting.

173
00:20:33,678 --> 00:20:35,168
Cheap melodrama.

174
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,201
¶ Was it we who forced our way to you? ¶

175
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,507
¶ Who was it sent her to her ruin? ¶

176
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,116
¶ I... ¶

177
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:45,684
¶ or you? ¶

178
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:50,215
¶ What evil thing has
risen from the ground? ¶

179
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:54,718
¶ Father, let angels now
have charge of me... ¶

180
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:57,796
¶ encamped around heavenly company. ¶

181
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:59,764
¶ She is condemned to die. ¶

182
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:03,995
¶ No, She is redeemed on high! ¶

183
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:05,869
¶ Hither, to me! ¶

184
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,012
Julia, my dear, you look flushed.

185
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:24,010
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, it's the theatre.

186
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:25,253
I love it...

187
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:27,884
even the cheap melodrama.

188
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:31,621
Will you excuse me?

189
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,992
Does she suffer from fevers?

190
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,265
She suffers from a little too much rouge.

191
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:47,197
Nonsense. A lady does not wear rouge.

192
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:49,002
No, a lady doesn't.

193
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:53,206
And a lady does not wander through
the theater alone, either.

194
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,345
Excuse me.

195
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,315
Perhaps you will find the
second act more appealing.

196
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:00,389
Excuse me, sir! The public
is not allowed backstage.

197
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:02,765
Just no... Don't put
your hands on me, sir.

198
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,107
That is my wife, damn it!

199
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,276
Luis, you've come to my rescue...
Julia!

200
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:09,609
Just like a play...

201
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:13,446
What are you doing here?

202
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:17,774
Isn't it exciting? Look at all
these mysterious contraptions.

203
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:21,716
- Who was that man?
- What man? I was lost, that's all.

204
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:23,717
You made my heart stop.

205
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:27,050
Feel my heart. Feel how fast it's beating?

206
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:32,786
Christ.

207
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,329
You'll be the death of me.

208
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:40,631
I hope so.

209
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,831
Places, please.

210
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:48,667
Ladies and gentlemen, places for act two.

211
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,346
Take me home now.

212
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,191
My own dearest sister.

213
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:17,065
I can't understand why you treat me thus.
It is many weeks now since you left me.

214
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:21,467
And in all that time, no word from you
to tell me of your safe arrival...

215
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:25,700
whether you've met Mr. Vargas, whether
the marriage has taken place or not.

216
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,572
What am I to think?

217
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,043
I have already contacted
the embassy in Havana...

218
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,483
and the authorities there in Santiago.

219
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:36,483
I know how you feel about her, but...

220
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,320
you have to write.

221
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,653
You have to write, before
she has the police on us.

222
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,391
Yes, you're right. I've been unkind to her.

223
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:50,026
Although she has never been kind to me.

224
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,759
Just... do it.

225
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:57,567
Do it, then it's done.

226
00:24:57,638 --> 00:24:59,529
No, no, no!

227
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,730
No, no.

228
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,380
No, no!

229
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:05,508
It's all right. All right.
It's me. It's me, Luis.

230
00:25:06,512 --> 00:25:07,844
You were dreaming.

231
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:11,114
Are you all right?

232
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:17,819
That's it. That's it.

233
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:21,017
You were just dreaming, just dreaming.

234
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,991
It's all right.

235
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:28,628
It was just a dream.

236
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:31,394
A bad one, that's all.

237
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:32,395
That's all.

238
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:41,803
It was just a dream.

239
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:44,445
Are you all right? You need something?

240
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:45,435
You.

241
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:47,578
I'm sorry.

242
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:50,075
You are here with me. Secure.

243
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,148
You're all right.

244
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,109
Will you stay?

245
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:55,618
Of course.

246
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,154
Of course.

247
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,619
It's all right.

248
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:35,248
Luis, don't go.

249
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:40,354
How is the queen of the house this morning?

250
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:47,659
Look. See? I've done it.

251
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:52,362
This is for the best. Thank you.

252
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:56,307
- I'll have Sara post it this morning.
- No need. I can do it myself.

253
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,375
- I haven't addressed it.
- I'll do it.

254
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:01,291
I have the address at the office.
Then it's the sooner on its way.

255
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:02,292
- Come on.
- Yes.

256
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,649
What will you do today?

257
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:16,489
I'm going to an English
dressmaker at the Plaza Vieja.

258
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,520
You'll need some money.

259
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,992
Sign here, Señora.

260
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:30,001
Did yo wish to book this for both your
personal and business account?

261
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:31,560
Yes, thank you.

262
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:35,031
I want my wife to have free
use of all my accounts.

263
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,399
There you are.

264
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:38,939
How should I sign?
Do I use my Christian name?

265
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:40,644
No, no, your married name.

266
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:44,546
And then you have to remember to
repeat the signature exactly...

267
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,614
each time you draw a check.

268
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,577
I will try.

269
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,090
Oh, man!

270
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,355
So, Luis, is it love after
all or is it just lust?

271
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,108
Is there a difference?

272
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:18,604
Oh, yes.

273
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:22,642
To love someone is to give and
then you want to give more.

274
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,606
And lust?

275
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:26,382
What is the lust, Alan?

276
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:30,548
Lust is to take and then take more.

277
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:33,653
To devour, to consume.
No logic, no reason.

278
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:36,657
So... give, take.

279
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:38,827
Which is it?

280
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,626
Both.

281
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,491
I want to give her everything.

282
00:28:47,202 --> 00:28:49,467
And I want to take everything from her.

283
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:54,170
Oh, Luis. You are a lost man.

284
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:55,874
No, no.

285
00:28:57,912 --> 00:29:00,342
I think she is the one
who seems to be lost.

286
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:04,611
How, why, I don't know.
But that will change.

287
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:07,383
I can change that.

288
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:15,652
Mr. Vargas, is it?

289
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:17,552
Yes.

290
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,395
Walter Downs. I didn't mean to startle you.

291
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,991
- That's allright.
- They told me that I find you upstairs.

292
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:24,768
- What can I do for you?
- Small matter.

293
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,870
Hardly worth your trouble. I've
been engaged by Miss Russell.

294
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:29,096
You mean, Julia?

295
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,670
No, Emily. Julia's sister.

296
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,966
In Delaware.

297
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,007
I'm a private investigator.

298
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,411
I recently arrived from Wilmington.

299
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:42,383
I understand. I mean, I know Miss
Russell has been distressed.

300
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:45,553
But we have written to
her several weeks ago.

301
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:50,324
I'm sure when she receives the letter,
she will be much relieved.

302
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:52,349
Then Miss Julia is all right?

303
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:54,380
Yes, more than all right...

304
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,032
and more than Miss Julia.

305
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:58,028
She's Señora Vargas.
She is my wife.

306
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,519
So you are married?

307
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,767
- Very good news.
- Happily married.

308
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,826
Oh, yes. I can see that.

309
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,501
What a mystery a happy marriage is.

310
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,542
A bloom in the cheek, the spark in the eye.

311
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,545
- It shows, I guess.
- Oh, yes, indeed.

312
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:18,041
And miss Russell will be
pleased to hear of it.

313
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:20,617
I would appreciate if
you can tell her that.

314
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:21,780
I will indeed.

315
00:30:22,794 --> 00:30:23,481
Thank you.

316
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:27,348
And I'll be even more convincing in my
report when I've met your wife.

317
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:31,785
Yes, yes.

318
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,592
Why not?

319
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:35,792
You see,

320
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:39,023
We will be home on Sunday afternoon.

321
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:41,630
You want to come by for a coffee?

322
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:42,790
Yes, I will.

323
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:46,470
And please convey to your wife how much
I'm looking forward to seeing her.

324
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,870
Well.

325
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:59,920
Oh, yes please outside On the terrace.

326
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:01,450
- Thank you.
- Go, go.

327
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:02,682
Do as she says.

328
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:03,782
Luis.

329
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:07,986
Oh, Just in time.

330
00:31:08,892 --> 00:31:12,455
This one is for Sunday paseo, and this
one for weekdays. What do you think?

331
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:14,652
Fine, fine.

332
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,421
And the rest?

333
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:19,497
This one I like.

334
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:23,369
What do you mean? There
are seven days in a week.

335
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:26,347
What about your trunk?
Is there nothing in there?

336
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:30,208
No, nothing good. Anyway,
I've lost the key.

337
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:34,004
We'll get a locksmith. It's an easy job.
Actually...

338
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:35,946
I'll do it myself.

339
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,383
No, I want to show you something.
Come here.

340
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:44,254
You have to leave now. I'm
going to kiss my husband.

341
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:46,924
And then we're going to take a bath.

342
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:05,467
What do I smell?

343
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,574
My perfume.

344
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:09,035
No.

345
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:12,276
A cigar.

346
00:32:13,914 --> 00:32:15,404
I tried one.

347
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,208
One of my cigars?

348
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,452
I wanted the taste of you in my mouth.

349
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:28,416
- You have no shame at all.
- No.

350
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:31,760
No, there is no shame in loving each other.

351
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:34,388
Do you love me? Julia?

352
00:32:35,065 --> 00:32:36,726
Do you love me?

353
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:39,963
Or are you not the loving kind?

354
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:21,767
I forgot to tell you.

355
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:26,298
We have a visitor coming on Sunday.

356
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:28,776
We do?

357
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:30,674
Yes...

358
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:33,574
a genuine private investigator...

359
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:37,345
coming all the way from Delaware.

360
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:41,085
So, Emily sent him.

361
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:44,121
Yeah. Detective Downs.

362
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,287
Detective Downs, did you say?

363
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:49,692
Don't be worry, he only needs
to see that you're well...

364
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,859
and happy and truly my wife.

365
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:58,501
- And then this nonsense will be over.
- When will that damn bird stop screaming?

366
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,599
Julia?

367
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,004
Careful, careful, careful.

368
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,340
It's coming, it's coming.

369
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,321
Oh, no.

370
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:29,091
No.

371
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:34,092
Don Luis, look. He's dead.

372
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:36,926
He was just singing.

373
00:34:37,038 --> 00:34:39,570
Well, he's not singing now, is he?

374
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,604
Looks like he got his little neck broken.

375
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:48,477
Take him away. I don't
want Julia to see him.

376
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:43,793
How does a person die on this instrument?

377
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:47,995
I believe that...

378
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:52,832
the turning of the wheel
breaks the neck of the person.

379
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,464
And if it doesn't?

380
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,369
Does the person then strangle?

381
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,671
Are you afraid?

382
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:06,135
No.

383
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,871
Julia is not afraid.

384
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,319
But Bonny is.

385
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:15,688
I don't understand.

386
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,214
Who is Bonny?

387
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,462
Who is Bonny?

388
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:28,492
I'm looking for Mr. Vargas.

389
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:31,131
That is a question that
Luis would soon be asking.

390
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,271
Mr. Vargas?

391
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:40,539
My name is Russell.

392
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:42,811
Emily Russell.

393
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:44,842
I am Julia's sister.

394
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:51,575
So you understand how upset I
was to receive this letter.

395
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,979
Upset?

396
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:57,652
But... l thought you would
be pleased to receive it.

397
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,790
This letter, sir...

398
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:04,824
Which was written in answer
to the one I last sent her...

399
00:37:04,965 --> 00:37:07,396
and which is signed in her name...

400
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,791
is not from Julia.

401
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:14,180
Of course it is. Of course.

402
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,833
I mailed it myself.

403
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:17,974
This letter was not written by my sister.

404
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,508
Miss Russell.

405
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:26,062
I'm sorry.

406
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:27,464
I'm sorry.

407
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:32,449
- Don't be upset, please. I swear to you...
- Swear as much as you like.

408
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:40,049
That is not Julia's handwriting.

409
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:42,862
That is the handwriting of a stranger.

410
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:45,094
A person unknown.

411
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,490
At least to me.

412
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:19,495
- Where is she?
- Senior, I was going to send for you.

413
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:20,926
Where is she?

414
00:38:21,964 --> 00:38:22,672
Go away. Go away.

415
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:24,796
- Oh, senior
- Get out!

416
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:35,936
Where did she go, Sara?

417
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:38,108
I don't know. She sent
me to the post office.

418
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:40,303
And when I come back...

419
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:23,509
She's not coming back, is she, Sara?

420
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,251
She never was here.

421
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:29,345
You've been married to a dream.

422
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:32,387
A dream that stole your soul.

423
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:00,407
Luis! What is it?

424
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:10,654
Your wife appeared at five minutes to three
for a last-minute withdrawal.

425
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,325
As you have instructed us, I gave her
full access to your accounts.

426
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,454
Your balance at closing time was...

427
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:22,067
51 American dollars and 40
cents in one account...

428
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,898
ten dollars in the other.

429
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,776
As I explained to your wife, to have closed
the both out completely...

430
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,640
your own signature would
have been necessary.

431
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:42,447
I'm sorry.

432
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,108
Don Luis?

433
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:47,638
God must have been angry
with you that day...

434
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:51,133
he let you look in that woman's face.

435
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,051
I want her back, Sara.

436
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,287
I want her back.

437
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,758
No, no, cariño. What for?

438
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,060
What for you want her back again?

439
00:43:57,495 --> 00:43:59,856
No, this is not a love story.

440
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,861
But it is a story about love.

441
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:10,101
About those who give in to
it, and the price they pay.

442
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:16,874
And those who run away from
it because they are afraid...

443
00:44:18,148 --> 00:44:21,780
or because they do not believe
they are worthy of it.

444
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,948
She ran away.

445
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:28,186
He gave in.

446
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:29,819
Mr. Vargas?

447
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:31,521
Yeah.

448
00:44:31,892 --> 00:44:33,253
Walter Downs.

449
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,724
What a happy coincidence.

450
00:44:40,132 --> 00:44:41,463
Oh, yeah.

451
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:44,363
I remember you.

452
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:53,649
And the authorities here,
they could do nothing?

453
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,817
Oh, no, no.

454
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:59,075
After all...

455
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:02,579
there was no crime.

456
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:08,988
She was my wife. She... she
just took what I had given her.

457
00:45:11,326 --> 00:45:12,758
Your money.

458
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,362
And your love.

459
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,595
And you did not suspect?

460
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:31,074
It seems that, that I know a lot less
about women than I thought I did.

461
00:45:31,877 --> 00:45:33,139
And I know too much.

462
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,236
Consequently, I've not much use for them...

463
00:45:36,382 --> 00:45:38,173
apart from the necessities.

464
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:41,579
For real intercourse, I
prefer the company of men.

465
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:44,685
Listen to me.

466
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:47,885
Could you find her?

467
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:53,393
Perhaps.

468
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:57,963
But I am, at the moment...

469
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:02,359
engaged to find the real Julia, the one
you were meant to marry.

470
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,400
Have you found her?

471
00:46:07,275 --> 00:46:09,565
Have you found her?

472
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:12,942
Not yet.

473
00:46:13,113 --> 00:46:15,307
If you do... if you do...

474
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,759
she might lead you to the Julia I married.

475
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:21,549
Perhaps.

476
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:24,119
And vice versa.

477
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:31,456
As much as you want I will pay,
if you can find her for me.

478
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:33,493
That's all I want.

479
00:46:34,198 --> 00:46:37,091
And then I assume you
have made up your losses.

480
00:46:38,235 --> 00:46:41,368
As much as you want, I will pay, I said it.

481
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:42,768
I will pay it.

482
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,370
Yes, I believe you would.

483
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:48,200
And if I did find your Julia?

484
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:51,012
If I brought her to you...

485
00:46:51,814 --> 00:46:53,577
or you to her...

486
00:46:54,983 --> 00:46:57,945
what good would it possibly do you now?

487
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,411
Money's gone.

488
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:02,653
The love...

489
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:04,719
ruined.

490
00:47:06,025 --> 00:47:08,355
What could you possibly want with her?

491
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:12,227
What could you possibly want?

492
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,931
I want to kill her.

493
00:47:41,855 --> 00:47:44,624
Yes. Yes, I do recall this lady.

494
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:47,189
Slim and dark and very...

495
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:52,425
I remember, coming along the deck and
the breeze catching her skirt.

496
00:47:52,698 --> 00:47:54,189
She was coming towards me.

497
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:59,265
Then she quickly held it down with her
hand and as she passed, she smiled.

498
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:03,204
I believe she was traveling with
a troupe of American actors...

499
00:48:03,205 --> 00:48:04,370
touring the island.

500
00:48:04,743 --> 00:48:06,804
Oh, yes, I remember.

501
00:48:07,378 --> 00:48:10,672
Because she rolled up some
lettuce in her napkin.

502
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:12,848
I thought it was strange.

503
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:15,551
But then she explained it was for her bird.

504
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:17,743
She was traveling with a bird.

505
00:48:18,053 --> 00:48:20,788
Oh, yes. Yes, I remember her.

506
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,659
A lady with a birdcage...

507
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,051
but this doesn't look like her.

508
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:29,626
She was young and very pretty.

509
00:48:31,065 --> 00:48:32,788
Oh, yes, that's her.

510
00:48:34,435 --> 00:48:37,499
And the real Julia never
appears, because...

511
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:39,164
she is dead.

512
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,128
You mean...

513
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:44,685
- You mean murder.
- Yes.

514
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:48,513
Or she could have had an accomplice.

515
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:51,144
These women often have an accomplice.

516
00:48:51,183 --> 00:48:54,146
Someone she might use and then discard.

517
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:58,953
Someone who might even now be in
pursuit of her, just as you and I are.

518
00:49:00,824 --> 00:49:02,516
And this is where it happened.

519
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:05,183
Here in Havana.

520
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:08,278
This way, gentlemen. And welcome to Havana.

521
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:14,267
Mr. Downs will be in room 37 and Mr. Vargas
will be just down the hall in room 42.

522
00:50:14,672 --> 00:50:15,667
Thank you.

523
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:20,206
I'll hook myself up with
the local authorities...

524
00:50:20,778 --> 00:50:23,969
and see if any dead bodies
have turned up recently.

525
00:50:24,212 --> 00:50:25,976
You're welcome to join me.

526
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:30,149
No, no, thank you.

527
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:35,652
Havana is a very accommodating city,
especially during Carnival.

528
00:50:35,856 --> 00:50:40,389
I suggest the Opera Restaurant, sir.
It's just across the street.

529
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:42,290
Thank you.

530
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:45,052
It's very popular with
the American tourists.

531
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,530
Why don't you do something
pleasant tonight?

532
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:58,598
Treat yourself to a good dinner,
a good cigar and a good whore.

533
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:01,999
I prefer to be alone. Thank you.

534
00:51:07,684 --> 00:51:10,545
So I'll leave you on your own then.

535
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:12,586
Good night.

536
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:12,660
Here you are.

537
00:52:13,106 --> 00:52:16,775
Privacy, and a view of the room.
If you see anything...

538
00:52:16,776 --> 00:52:22,613
or anyone who interests you, let me know
and I'll see what I can arrange.

539
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:24,713
Thank you.

540
00:52:40,096 --> 00:52:44,996
If I could have my coffee every morning
before I dressed, I would be very happy.

541
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:47,057
It would change the day.

542
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:50,532
I would be very happy.

543
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:52,596
It would change the day.

544
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:56,075
Then that is what you shall have.

545
00:52:56,076 --> 00:53:00,713
When we are married, you shall
have everything you wish.

546
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:04,817
Married? Your wife might have
something to say about that.

547
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,316
This way, Colonel, s'il vous plaît.

548
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:10,178
S'il vous plaît indeed,
you silly mountebank.

549
00:53:10,256 --> 00:53:13,247
- You're about as French as my asshole!
- Edwin, curb your tongue.

550
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:14,248
Yes, ma'am.

551
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,795
May I help you, sir?

552
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:30,528
I thought I saw an old friend of mine.

553
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,307
Colonel...
- Colonel Worth? - Yes.

554
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,843
Oh, yes. This way.

555
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:36,273
No, no, no. I...

556
00:53:37,078 --> 00:53:39,137
I wouldn't bother him now.

557
00:53:40,347 --> 00:53:41,874
Is he staying at the hotel?

558
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:46,313
No, he's at home in Havana.
He lives at avenida Medios.

559
00:53:46,653 --> 00:53:49,244
I believe his fiancée is at the hotel.

560
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:51,412
His fiancée?

561
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,322
Yes, Miss Castle.

562
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:56,686
Yes, yes, yes.

563
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,591
I see. Thank you.

564
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:25,685
My dear, I don't have that kind of money.

565
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:27,280
But, my dear, you do.

566
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:30,987
Your annual expenditures are
$200,000, more or less.

567
00:54:30,988 --> 00:54:31,988
How...

568
00:54:32,293 --> 00:54:33,817
How do you know that?

569
00:54:33,994 --> 00:54:37,802
Because, under favorable
conditions, you could realize at

570
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:41,633
least 1.5 million pounds of
sugar worth in good seasons.

571
00:54:41,634 --> 00:54:43,235
- Five cents a pound...
- No, don't, don't.

572
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:47,196
Don't make me talk about business now.

573
00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:53,040
I've been waiting for this all night.

574
00:55:02,518 --> 00:55:04,544
Now, don't watch.

575
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,785
Be kind, my dove.

576
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:10,451
- Be kind to an old man.
- I am kind.

577
00:55:10,726 --> 00:55:12,454
Kind as I have ever been.

578
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:24,730
Will you undo my dress, please?

579
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:27,271
Oh, yes.

580
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,441
Let me have that pleasure.

581
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:36,510
That's enough. Thank you.

582
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:38,245
Thank you...

583
00:55:39,184 --> 00:55:41,283
for a wonderful evening. Good night.

584
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:42,547
- No.
- Yes.

585
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,949
I'll behave. I'll only sit and watch you.

586
00:55:46,656 --> 00:55:47,987
You see...

587
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:50,219
I sit...

588
00:55:50,926 --> 00:55:52,154
and I watch.

589
00:55:52,294 --> 00:55:54,690
- Is that what you want?
- You know.

590
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:59,396
You are very tiresome and I am very tired.

591
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:01,926
- Good night.
- No.

592
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,507
- No.
- Good night.

593
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:06,338
- No.
- Yes, goog night.

594
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,500
No.

595
00:56:08,176 --> 00:56:11,539
Mayn't I stay? Please, let me stay.

596
00:56:16,182 --> 00:56:18,673
Darling dove, I'm weeping.

597
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:21,380
My heart is pudding.

598
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:25,250
I'll go.

599
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:28,549
But my pudding is all broken.

600
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,488
Good night...

601
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,059
my little dove.

602
00:56:35,332 --> 00:56:36,664
Good night.

603
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:40,528
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

604
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,337
It's only me, Julia.

605
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:38,649
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

606
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:45,582
Who's Billy?

607
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:49,223
Just a fellow.

608
00:57:51,498 --> 00:57:54,259
There must be quite a few
fellows in your life.

609
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:56,929
Billy...

610
00:57:57,869 --> 00:57:59,098
me...

611
00:57:59,871 --> 00:58:01,203
the Colonel.

612
00:58:02,173 --> 00:58:03,834
Did you marry all of them?

613
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:06,738
- No, just you.
- Oh, Liar.

614
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:09,376
Liar.

615
00:58:13,884 --> 00:58:15,214
Liar.

616
00:58:23,026 --> 00:58:24,925
Well, what is it, then?

617
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,964
- What is it?
- Yes.

618
00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:29,120
What are your plans for me?

619
00:58:29,764 --> 00:58:31,130
My plans?

620
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,998
I just came here to kill you.

621
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:44,900
My God.

622
00:58:48,413 --> 00:58:50,404
All right, do it.

623
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:01,087
There. There's my heart. Don't hesitate.

624
00:59:01,357 --> 00:59:03,382
Your money's gone. Do it.

625
00:59:04,228 --> 00:59:05,388
Gone.

626
00:59:06,596 --> 00:59:08,359
Like the woman you murdered?

627
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:11,754
What? No.

628
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:12,900
Yes.

629
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:16,496
- You were with her on that boat!
- Believe what you heard from me.

630
00:59:16,497 --> 00:59:18,933
You were seen together!

631
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:23,610
- I wasn't alone.
- She told you all about me, didn't she?

632
00:59:23,611 --> 00:59:24,803
No!

633
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,002
I told him!

634
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:28,795
And he came to me next morning,

635
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:30,820
he told me that she had
met with an accident

636
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,866
and I have to take her
place and So I did.

637
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,217
Another man?

638
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:37,085
Accomplice?

639
00:59:37,154 --> 00:59:38,951
Friend? Lover?

640
00:59:39,024 --> 00:59:40,354
An accomplice...

641
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:45,651
You saw us together,
backstage, at the play.

642
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:48,857
My friend, my accomplice and...

643
00:59:49,098 --> 00:59:51,464
yes, yes, my lover.

644
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:55,468
He was an actor, like myself.
Actors playing parts.

645
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:59,733
I told him that night, I told him I didn't
want to go through with it.

646
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:01,438
I couldn't go through with it anymore.

647
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:02,907
Why not? Why not?

648
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,406
Because...

649
01:00:05,014 --> 01:00:06,914
Because I was...

650
01:00:07,348 --> 01:00:09,782
Damn it. I was falling in
love with my own husband.

651
01:00:09,783 --> 01:00:11,444
Again. Again.

652
01:00:14,387 --> 01:00:16,307
I could have... l could
have bought him off!

653
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,250
I could have kept him away!

654
01:00:18,391 --> 01:00:21,460
But you made me write to her
sister and then it was all over!

655
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:22,550
Whore!

656
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,121
Thief!

657
01:00:25,696 --> 01:00:28,531
It's how I live. It's all I know.

658
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:31,929
I took the money and I gave it to him.

659
01:00:33,086 --> 01:00:35,995
No... And then I ran.

660
01:00:41,743 --> 01:00:43,404
What does it matter?

661
01:00:43,613 --> 01:00:45,239
What does it matter?

662
01:00:45,314 --> 01:00:46,611
It's over.

663
01:00:49,217 --> 01:00:50,615
Whore!

664
01:00:50,686 --> 01:00:52,210
Liar! Thief!

665
01:00:52,386 --> 01:00:53,283
Yes!

666
01:00:53,355 --> 01:00:54,983
- Yes! Yes.
- Don't you see...

667
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,984
Don't you see...

668
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,525
Don't you see that I cannot
breathe without you?

669
01:00:59,626 --> 01:01:01,118
I cannot live without you!

670
01:01:01,226 --> 01:01:04,190
Don't you see that?
Don't you see how much I love you?

671
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,800
I'm sorry.

672
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:50,497
Where am I?

673
01:01:54,507 --> 01:01:55,837
Who are you?

674
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:01,004
Really.

675
01:02:01,912 --> 01:02:03,573
My name is Bonny.

676
01:02:04,882 --> 01:02:06,372
Bonny Castle.

677
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:10,009
Bonny Castle.

678
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,216
Is that your Christian name?

679
01:02:16,725 --> 01:02:18,125
It would be...

680
01:02:18,828 --> 01:02:20,455
if I were Christian.

681
01:02:21,263 --> 01:02:22,754
But I'm not.

682
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:26,262
I was never baptized.

683
01:02:27,101 --> 01:02:28,796
I was a foundling.

684
01:02:31,271 --> 01:02:32,861
And so was Billy.

685
01:02:43,715 --> 01:02:46,908
We were raised in an orphanage
outside of St. Louis.

686
01:02:48,453 --> 01:02:50,148
And he gave me my name.

687
01:02:51,156 --> 01:02:54,292
He saw it on a picture
postcard from Scotland.

688
01:02:54,558 --> 01:02:59,354
It had a drawing on it, of
a "bonny castle", it said.

689
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:04,060
When we were 14, we ran away together.

690
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,862
Like brother, sister, father,
daughter, husband, wife.

691
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:11,469
- He was my salvation.
- No.

692
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:14,008
No.

693
01:03:16,244 --> 01:03:18,041
I don't want to know.

694
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,108
Not now.

695
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,943
You are Julia Russell from
Wilmington, Delaware.

696
01:03:30,155 --> 01:03:31,782
You were born...

697
01:03:32,324 --> 01:03:34,754
the day you stepped off that boat...

698
01:03:35,627 --> 01:03:37,527
and became my wife.

699
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:43,556
But then...

700
01:03:43,835 --> 01:03:46,698
then I am not Julia Russell at all, am I?

701
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:51,405
I'm simply your wife.

702
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:46,154
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

703
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:48,648
It's Edwin, my dear.

704
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,081
Am I too early?

705
01:04:51,927 --> 01:04:53,588
Don't hurry.

706
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:59,327
Nothing gives me more pleasure than
to wait for you outside your door.

707
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,630
Unless, of course, you were to let me in.

708
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,415
- Colonel Worth.
- Good God!

709
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:23,617
- May I help you, sir?
- You are not dressed, sir.

710
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,418
No, I am not.

711
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:28,956
I am engaged at the moment
in a private function.

712
01:05:28,957 --> 01:05:32,459
A function for which clothes are
more of a hindrance, not a help.

713
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,654
A private function?

714
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:34,852
Yes, sir.

715
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:37,663
With Bonny? A private function?

716
01:05:37,732 --> 01:05:39,393
Good God, man!

717
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:42,996
But I'm... I'm being rude.
Please, please come in.

718
01:05:43,804 --> 01:05:45,362
No, sir. Are you mad?

719
01:05:45,438 --> 01:05:47,100
Mad? No.

720
01:05:47,975 --> 01:05:52,668
I am only curious to know what exactly is
your business at my wife's door.

721
01:05:56,316 --> 01:05:57,749
Your wife?

722
01:05:59,016 --> 01:06:00,507
Did you say, "wife"?

723
01:06:00,986 --> 01:06:02,954
Edwin, Edwin be careful.

724
01:06:03,154 --> 01:06:05,123
He has a fearful temper.

725
01:06:06,692 --> 01:06:08,750
I beg your pardon, sir. I do.

726
01:06:09,593 --> 01:06:11,254
I beg your pardon.

727
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,592
I am an old fool.

728
01:06:14,097 --> 01:06:15,758
I didn't know.

729
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,258
I'm sorry.

730

731
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:28,265
Good morning to you, sir.

732
01:06:29,537 --> 01:06:30,565
Good morning.

733
01:06:30,837 --> 01:06:33,259
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

734
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:39,879
You see?

735
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:43,347
You have no past.

736
01:06:44,623 --> 01:06:46,956
It is gone. Finished.

737
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:49,286
Disappeared.

738
01:06:51,795 --> 01:06:53,660
You have only me now.

739
01:07:13,457 --> 01:07:14,531
Morning.

740
01:07:14,582 --> 01:07:17,342
There you are. You weren't
in your room this morning.

741
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:20,419
I have some very interesting news.

742
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,911
So do I.

743
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:31,088
"A woman's body found."

744
01:07:31,397 --> 01:07:34,088
"Foul play suspected."
How's my Spanish?

745
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:38,592
Julia Russell?

746
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:43,570
Stabbed in the neck with a small
knife, then thrown overboard.

747
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:47,106
Probably the work of a man, but
could've easily been a woman.

748
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,245
The blade of the knife
was still in her throat.

749
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:54,274
And so your wife...

750
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,250
is now officially a fugitive.

751
01:07:57,419 --> 01:08:00,316
Not only you and I are pursuing
her, but the police, as well.

752
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:03,489
Cheer up now. This is good news.

753
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,851
It won't be long now before she's caught.

754
01:08:06,727 --> 01:08:07,717
She...

755
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:10,057
didn't do this.

756
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,262
I believe you still love her, don't you?

757
01:08:20,272 --> 01:08:21,398
Of course.

758
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:26,104
How could you hate her so much
if you did not still love her?

759
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:31,675
Trust me, my friend. There's
no such thing as love.

760
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:34,282
Or only misguided feelings and emotions.

761
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:36,714
It was my knife. He used my knife.

762
01:08:36,715 --> 01:08:37,715
Yes, yes.

763
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,685
- It wasn't me, I promise you.
- I believe you.

764
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:44,425
No one else will never
believe that I'm innocent.

765
01:08:44,426 --> 01:08:45,691
Listen to me.

766
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,428
No one else matters. Not to me.

767
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,968
What are you thinking?

768
01:09:03,343 --> 01:09:04,231
Of you.

769
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:14,341
Welcome to Cardenas.

770
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:18,988
Right this way. This is the entrance.
It's very elegant...

771
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,550
in a very good part of town.

772
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,786
Mostly Americans and
tourists from the Continent.

773
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:30,893
I think you'll find all the
furnishings you need included.

774
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,526
A bedroom...

775
01:09:32,772 --> 01:09:35,698
a sitting room, a very good kitchen.

776
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:42,436
Here in Cardenas, you
are close to Havana...

777
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:44,570
but very far away.

778
01:09:45,446 --> 01:09:50,281
We are known for the waters and for
the healing powers of the sun.

779
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:26,608
Vargas.

780
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:29,915
What a happy accident.

781
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,081
Yes, yes indeed.

782
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,811
What brings you to Cardenas?

783
01:10:36,355 --> 01:10:38,417
Not a rest cure, I assure you.

784
01:10:39,257 --> 01:10:41,248
No, of course not.

785
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:45,052
There were reports of a woman
answering a certain description.

786
01:10:45,053 --> 01:10:47,498
She was seen boarding a train heading East.

787
01:10:47,499 --> 01:10:51,266
You haven't seen or heard
anything, have you?

788
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:55,128
I've lost my taste for
women of that description.

789
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,197
Glad to hear of it.

790
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,741
Listen...

791
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:04,706
can I offer you a piñales?

792
01:11:04,914 --> 01:11:06,278
What's that?

793
01:11:06,715 --> 01:11:08,047
A drink.

794
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,547
A drink.

795
01:11:09,817 --> 01:11:12,282
There's a cafe down the street.

796
01:11:16,557 --> 01:11:18,218
The sun is warm.

797
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:21,989
Your face, for instance, is quite moist.

798
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:35,262
The body was positively
identified by her sister.

799
01:11:35,406 --> 01:11:38,240
Very sad, but very accurate.

800
01:11:38,575 --> 01:11:41,904
Two moles high on the inner thigh...

801
01:11:42,547 --> 01:11:44,942
and a gold crown on a back tooth.

802
01:11:44,943 --> 01:11:49,445
And on her left hand, a small, round scar.

803
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:51,577
Very interesting.

804
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,957
Will you excuse me? I have
to use the convenience.

805
01:11:57,024 --> 01:11:58,685
By all means.

806
01:12:00,694 --> 01:12:02,356
Do as you must.

807
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:36,556
Julia?

808
01:12:38,286 --> 01:12:39,485
Come here.

809
01:12:40,229 --> 01:12:42,220
Come upstairs. We...

810
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:45,563
Ah, Luis.

811
01:12:47,002 --> 01:12:48,663
I am disappointed.

812
01:12:51,445 --> 01:12:54,169
And yet full of admiration.

813
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,443
Where is she?

814
01:12:59,512 --> 01:13:00,844
Who? No.

815
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,842
- She's not here.
- You called her name.

816
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:04,875
Wait, wait. You have no business here.

817
01:13:04,918 --> 01:13:08,880
Downs, please. Be smart and leave.
Get out while you still can.

818
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,008
She's mine, Luis.

819
01:13:10,156 --> 01:13:12,414
Give her up, before it's too late.

820
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:15,188
You are aiding a criminal!

821
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:19,162
And you are very close to
becoming a criminal yourself.

822
01:13:19,163 --> 01:13:20,857
Come to your senses, man.

823
01:13:21,365 --> 01:13:24,027
You saw it. She's not here. Now, please.

824
01:13:24,028 --> 01:13:24,701
Please.

825
01:13:24,702 --> 01:13:27,067
Don't lie to me, Mr. Vargas.

826
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:29,435
I can smell her on you.

827
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:33,363
Her perfume, stinking on your clothing.

828
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,574
You just left her, didn't you?

829
01:13:35,643 --> 01:13:37,634
That's it. Get out.

830
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,216
Did she throw her arms around you?
Embrace you, like this?

831
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:46,749
Did she rub her cheek
against yours, like this?

832
01:13:46,887 --> 01:13:49,048
Did she kiss you on the mouth?

833
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:52,321
If I kiss you now, will I taste her on you?

834
01:14:06,938 --> 01:14:08,666
You would do this for her?

835
01:14:08,874 --> 01:14:09,667
Luis!

836
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:12,218
Wait! Wait.

837
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:13,433
Wait.

838
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:17,869
Speak of the devil, and she appears.

839
01:14:25,686 --> 01:14:27,847
My God. What have you done?

840
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:31,455
- What have you done?
- It's... It's him.

841
01:14:32,326 --> 01:14:34,122
It's the detective.

842
01:14:35,795 --> 01:14:37,356
He came here for you.

843
01:14:46,406 --> 01:14:48,471
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

844
01:14:48,472 --> 01:14:50,267
Don't touch him!

845
01:14:57,748 --> 01:15:00,575
- Did he come here alone?
- Yes.

846
01:15:00,716 --> 01:15:02,177
No one saw him come in?

847
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:03,378
I... I... I...

848
01:15:04,053 --> 01:15:06,043
I... I don't know.

849
01:15:06,388 --> 01:15:08,379
Christ, Julia.

850
01:15:09,325 --> 01:15:10,658
I've killed a man.

851
01:15:11,225 --> 01:15:13,689
You need to go now, go
to the train station.

852
01:15:13,728 --> 01:15:17,454
Secure two seats on the morning
train east, no matter where.

853
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,255
And...

854
01:15:19,256 --> 01:15:23,101
I will contact the estate agent and tell
him that we've changed our minds...

855
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,503
and there's been an emergency.

856
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:28,771
Julia.

857
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,098
Yes, what?

858
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,712
I've just killed a man.

859
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:39,445
And I just bought a hat.

860
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:45,609
But I don't dwell on it. I
don't go around and saying

861
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:48,290
over and over in my head,
"I just bought a hat."

862
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:50,460
"I just bought a hat."
It doesn't matter.

863
01:15:50,526 --> 01:15:51,626
It doesn't matter.

864
01:15:52,794 --> 01:15:55,126
It's done. Help me.

865
01:15:56,898 --> 01:15:58,058
God.

866
01:16:09,743 --> 01:16:12,401
- That I should do it.
- I'll bring him down.

867
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:13,245
No.

868
01:16:13,246 --> 01:16:16,107
No, you need to go to the station
before the window closes.

869
01:16:17,449 --> 01:16:19,483
- Come here. Put these on.
- Yes, yes, yes.

870
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:20,781
Yes, I'll hurry.

871
01:16:20,853 --> 01:16:22,480
No. No, don't hurry.

872
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:26,355
Go slowly, enjoy the walk
and no one notice you.

873
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:28,244
- Understand?
- Yes.

874
01:16:28,245 --> 01:16:29,122
Good.

875
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,120
Billy.

876
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,483
You finally got what you deserved.

877
01:17:21,272 --> 01:17:23,672
- Jesus!
- Aren't you glad to see me?

878
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:26,441
Aren't you glad to see old
Detective Downs again?

879
01:17:26,443 --> 01:17:27,501
Should I be?

880
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:31,044
I got very good notices
playing this part in Chicago.

881
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:32,478
Or don't you remember?

882
01:17:32,549 --> 01:17:34,379
Let go of me, Billy.

883
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,914
You thought I was...

884
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,414
really dead...

885
01:17:40,954 --> 01:17:42,252
didn't you?

886
01:17:53,031 --> 01:17:55,825
Did you think there were real
bullets in that gun, huh?

887
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:59,735
Did you think they were real the night
he came to murder you?

888
01:18:00,605 --> 01:18:05,399
I couldn't risk his putting out your
lights, not before I caught up with you.

889
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:08,510
- Let go of me, Billy.
- Never.

890
01:18:08,545 --> 01:18:11,012
- Not untill you come back on the game.
- What game?

891
01:18:11,013 --> 01:18:13,149
The skin game, darling. Skin game.

892
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:14,480
There is no game.

893
01:18:14,717 --> 01:18:16,480
Oh, yes. I see it so clearly.

894
01:18:16,518 --> 01:18:18,380
No, no.

895
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:20,711
What do you see, huh?

896
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:26,582
I see him running out of money.
I see you arranging that.

897
01:18:26,727 --> 01:18:28,988
I see him doing the only thing he can do.

898
01:18:28,989 --> 01:18:32,898
I see him going to Santiago,
selling his share of the company.

899
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:35,399
I see him coming back with money.

900
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,966
I see us... finishing
what we started.

901
01:18:39,571 --> 01:18:40,971
You and me together.

902
01:18:41,106 --> 01:18:43,968
We're gonna make you a rich widow.

903
01:18:47,512 --> 01:18:48,468
No.

904
01:18:49,648 --> 01:18:53,150
He's worth a hell of a lot more than we
got out of him the first time, darling.

905
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:56,908
And he's such an easy mark,
devoted as he is to you.

906
01:18:57,253 --> 01:19:02,018
Bound together as you are by
mutual crimes and various...

907
01:19:02,224 --> 01:19:03,714
misdemeanors.

908
01:19:04,692 --> 01:19:06,502
- Let go of me, please.
- Beg.

909
01:19:06,504 --> 01:19:07,172
Please.

910
01:19:07,173 --> 01:19:09,027
- Please, let go!
- Beg.

911
01:19:12,033 --> 01:19:15,565
It tickles my dick when you beg.

912
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:19,361
He says he loves me.

913
01:19:22,376 --> 01:19:24,207
No one loves you, Bonny.

914
01:19:24,277 --> 01:19:25,835
No one could.

915
01:19:26,212 --> 01:19:27,702
Except for me.

916
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:30,912
He does.

917
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:32,683
I think he does.

918
01:19:32,818 --> 01:19:36,009
Not enough to live the life of a fugitive.

919
01:19:37,554 --> 01:19:39,887
Back alleys, cheap hotels...

920
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:41,489
It won't be like that.

921
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,520
Oh, how then? Happily ever after?

922
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,828
A nice, respectable couple,
living on Main Street?

923
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:50,089
Sunday dinners, walks in
the park with children?

924
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:53,399
Christ, what's he done to you?

925
01:19:54,102 --> 01:19:56,127
Who do you think you are?

926
01:19:56,605 --> 01:19:58,664
Who does he think you are?

927
01:19:59,907 --> 01:20:01,898
You're a whore, Bonny.

928
01:20:02,176 --> 01:20:05,368
A man puts his hands on
you, and you're wet.

929
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:08,841
True or not?

930
01:20:12,786 --> 01:20:14,977
You were born one and you'll die one.

931
01:20:15,021 --> 01:20:17,882
Sooner or later if the
police catch up with you.

932
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:22,453
You wouldn't do that to me.

933
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:26,228
I was your first man, Bonny.
Your very first.

934
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:28,629
And I will be...

935
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:30,423
your last.

936
01:20:31,935 --> 01:20:33,766
One way or another.

937
01:20:36,505 --> 01:20:39,196
There's no future with him, darling.

938
01:20:39,842 --> 01:20:41,673
Face the truth.

939
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,671
You can't live his life.

940
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,647
And he certainly...

941
01:20:47,048 --> 01:20:48,776
can't live yours.

942
01:20:50,351 --> 01:20:51,842
Let him go.

943
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:55,949
No.

944
01:20:56,123 --> 01:20:57,285
Let him go.

945
01:20:57,486 --> 01:20:58,386
No.

946
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:00,614
Let him go.

947
01:21:07,816 --> 01:21:09,193
Yes.

948
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,410
Julia?

949
01:21:42,191 --> 01:21:43,066
Julia?

950
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:51,330
I was so hungry.

951
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,742
What about him?

952
01:21:56,909 --> 01:21:59,600
- We have to get rid of the body.
- No, it's done.

953
01:22:00,912 --> 01:22:02,105
It's done?

954
01:22:05,047 --> 01:22:06,639
You mean you did it yourself?

955
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:12,313
I packed all our things, as well. I left
one suit out on the bed, for the train.

956
01:22:12,956 --> 01:22:14,446
So did you get the tickets?

957
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,592
- The tickets? Yes, yes.
- Good.

958
01:22:17,593 --> 01:22:19,492
We go tomorrow in the morning.

959
01:22:19,594 --> 01:22:21,722
Back to Havana. 7:00, yes.

960
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:25,927
What an adventure.

961
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:30,526
Come to bed.

962
01:22:31,771 --> 01:22:33,636
You must be exhausted.

963
01:22:34,072 --> 01:22:35,030
I know I am.

964
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:37,640
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Yes?

965
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,443
Have you no conscience at all?

966
01:22:40,947 --> 01:22:42,278
I mean...

967
01:22:43,614 --> 01:22:44,946
Yes, of course I do.

968
01:22:45,183 --> 01:22:48,816
But you see, I don't let
it get the best of me.

969
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:52,980
It's just something that happened.
Something it had to be done.

970
01:22:53,624 --> 01:22:55,918
And when something has to
be done, you do it, right?

971
01:22:55,919 --> 01:23:00,828
So, here's to us. A short
life, but an exciting one.

972
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:06,557
Good night.

973
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:13,435
Listen to her talk.

974
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:16,977
Listen to the words that
came out of her mouth.

975
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:18,467
You mean Bonny?

976
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:20,736
Yes, Bonny.

977
01:23:23,483 --> 01:23:26,074
Did you have no control over her?

978
01:23:27,786 --> 01:23:30,087
No one had control over her.

979
01:23:30,822 --> 01:23:32,312
No one did.

980
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:38,093
No one, except for Billy.

981
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:41,961
And he wanted the rest of the money.

982
01:23:45,268 --> 01:23:48,459
They found a house in the
poor section of town.

983
01:23:48,604 --> 01:23:52,468
Bonny said they would go unnoticed
there, and she was right.

984
01:23:53,109 --> 01:23:56,401
There were many things that would
go unnoticed in that house.

985
01:23:58,614 --> 01:24:01,448
All she had to do was
get Luis to Santiago...

986
01:24:02,649 --> 01:24:04,677
and it would all be over.

987
01:24:11,057 --> 01:24:13,390
No, no, you don't understand.

988
01:24:14,726 --> 01:24:18,061
- We've run out?
- Yes, I'll go tomorrow to Santiago.

989
01:24:18,062 --> 01:24:20,763
I'll take the first train in the morning.

990
01:24:23,068 --> 01:24:24,796
What will you do there?

991
01:24:24,902 --> 01:24:27,063
We need money, don't we?

992
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,071
Whatever you say.

993
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:43,530
Julia?

994
01:24:47,255 --> 01:24:49,889
I don't want you to go to Santiago.

995
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,683
But, but... I have to go.

996
01:24:52,815 --> 01:24:54,251
I don't want you to go.

997
01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:56,152
I have no choice.

998
01:24:57,263 --> 01:24:59,293
Yes, you do. You have a choice.

999
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,065
Once again.

1000
01:25:02,302 --> 01:25:05,129
- When my hand strays to my breast...
- Hearts.

1001
01:25:05,271 --> 01:25:07,305
- My left eardrop.
- Diamonds.

1002
01:25:07,306 --> 01:25:09,069
- My right eardrop.
- Clubs.

1003
01:25:09,473 --> 01:25:10,998
- My throat.
- Spades.

1004
01:25:11,275 --> 01:25:14,044
- Little finger of my left hand.
- One.

1005
01:25:14,045 --> 01:25:16,235
- Little finger of my right hand.
- Ten.

1006
01:25:16,646 --> 01:25:18,159
When I do this, it
means they have nothing.

1007
01:25:18,172 --> 01:25:19,696
Right.

1008
01:25:22,453 --> 01:25:24,181
- King, queen, jack.
- Yes.

1009
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,144
Yes.

1010
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:30,051
Oh, you're a natural.

1011
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:32,459
- But, listen to me...
- This is the way.

1012
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,651
This is the only way. This is our way.

1013
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:37,625
This is you and me, together.

1014
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,132
Please.

1015
01:25:44,404 --> 01:25:45,666
Now...

1016
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:49,071
tell me what I'm holding.

1017
01:26:02,553 --> 01:26:04,744
Would you like some more whiskey?

1018
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:08,450
Too rich for me.

1019
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:12,588
Yes. Why not?

1020
01:26:13,762 --> 01:26:16,424
Why not, indeed? All right.

1021
01:26:18,101 --> 01:26:19,363
He wins again.

1022
01:26:19,935 --> 01:26:21,765
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1023
01:26:22,269 --> 01:26:23,760
More champagne.

1024
01:26:28,775 --> 01:26:31,466
Does the lady mind if I remove my coat?

1025
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,469
No, do and say as you please.

1026
01:26:33,848 --> 01:26:36,379
Try and forget that I am even here.

1027
01:26:36,383 --> 01:26:37,872
Easier said than done.

1028
01:26:43,222 --> 01:26:45,052
Can I get you another drink?

1029
01:27:18,418 --> 01:27:21,179
Will you ask the lady to retire, sir?

1030
01:27:23,824 --> 01:27:25,189
What do you mean?

1031
01:27:25,257 --> 01:27:26,657
Do you have to be told?

1032
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:31,393
Take your hand from my wife. Please, sir.

1033
01:27:32,597 --> 01:27:33,689
Gladly.

1034
01:27:35,332 --> 01:27:38,768
If there is one thing lower than
a man who cheated at cards...

1035
01:27:38,769 --> 01:27:42,406
it's a man who use a woman
to do his cheating for him.

1036
01:28:16,568 --> 01:28:17,900
Julia?

1037
01:28:25,243 --> 01:28:26,574
Well, my dear...

1038
01:28:28,747 --> 01:28:32,109
let's see what other tricks you might know.

1039
01:28:59,872 --> 01:29:01,601
Are you all right?

1040
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:03,200
Yes.

1041
01:29:04,209 --> 01:29:05,369
Should I...

1042
01:29:06,043 --> 01:29:08,376
Should I call someone?

1043
01:29:12,716 --> 01:29:14,377
You are so kind.

1044
01:29:16,888 --> 01:29:20,387
You are so young and innocent and kind.

1045
01:29:23,026 --> 01:29:24,219
No.

1046
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,718
No one is innocent.

1047
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:35,062
You have a story as well.

1048
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,731
Will you tell me...

1049
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,068
if there's time?

1050
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:46,234
I have no story.

1051
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,171
Not like yours.

1052
01:29:50,082 --> 01:29:52,945
Well, it was Bonny's story now.

1053
01:29:54,653 --> 01:29:56,618
And look what she had done.

1054
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:01,862
He could not live in her world.

1055
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,891
And she would never fit into his.

1056
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:00,275
Dear Alan:

1057
01:31:00,842 --> 01:31:02,503
Congratulations.

1058
01:31:03,111 --> 01:31:08,305
You have just purchased my share of
Vargas-Jordan Coffee Export House.

1059
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:13,046
The price I have settled on is
everything that was in the safe...

1060
01:31:13,232 --> 01:31:17,721
which I believe is very much
in your favor. I'm sorry.

1061
01:31:17,891 --> 01:31:19,381
Luis! Wait!

1062
01:31:19,525 --> 01:31:22,820
I'm sorry I couldn't wait to
discuss this with you. But...

1063
01:31:23,696 --> 01:31:27,888
as you may know, I am now
a fugitive from justice.

1064
01:31:28,033 --> 01:31:30,566
More than that, I cannot say.

1065
01:31:30,601 --> 01:31:32,492
What are you talking about?

1066
01:31:32,671 --> 01:31:33,959
- What have you...
- Murder.

1067
01:31:35,873 --> 01:31:37,464
I have done murder.

1068
01:31:38,209 --> 01:31:39,870
- No.
- Yes.

1069
01:31:40,211 --> 01:31:41,700
I did it for her.

1070
01:31:43,047 --> 01:31:44,708
And the truth is...

1071
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:47,175
that I would do it again.

1072
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,881
Good luck to you.

1073
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:55,912
And thank you for having
once been my friend.

1074
01:31:58,325 --> 01:31:59,656
Go on. Go on.

1075
01:32:06,266 --> 01:32:07,631
God help you.

1076
01:34:06,314 --> 01:34:07,775
Will you light me a cigar?

1077
01:34:09,307 --> 01:34:10,306
Yes.

1078
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:13,118
I'll make us some coffee.

1079
01:34:21,361 --> 01:34:22,423
Damn!

1080
01:34:22,494 --> 01:34:24,630
- What happened?
- There's a rat.

1081
01:34:24,632 --> 01:34:27,891
- A rat?
- There's a rat. It ran right over my foot.

1082
01:34:29,234 --> 01:34:30,564
Do you see it?

1083
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:32,259
No.

1084
01:34:37,676 --> 01:34:39,472
- I didn't see it.
- No?

1085
01:34:39,544 --> 01:34:40,875
What are you doing?

1086
01:34:41,078 --> 01:34:42,739
I'm going to the pharmacist.

1087
01:34:43,081 --> 01:34:44,877
- At this hour?
- Yes.

1088
01:34:45,115 --> 01:34:46,721
It's 9.00. It's closed.

1089
01:34:46,734 --> 01:34:48,350
No, there is one the
private open till 10:00.

1090
01:34:48,351 --> 01:34:51,213
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
- I won't be long.

1091
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,688
You can't save him, darling.
If that's what you're thinking.

1092
01:36:50,689 --> 01:36:53,352
Why not? Why can't we just go?

1093
01:36:54,393 --> 01:36:56,754
I have two tickets for us on the train.

1094
01:36:57,094 --> 01:36:59,422
Tonight, midnight. We have the money.

1095
01:36:59,798 --> 01:37:00,526
Leave him.

1096
01:37:00,598 --> 01:37:04,632
Oh, Bonny, it doesn't suit
you, this kind of compassion.

1097
01:37:05,836 --> 01:37:09,971
How could I trust you?
There'd always be someone between us.

1098
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,701
Why? Why hurt him?

1099
01:37:11,741 --> 01:37:14,132
He's a part of you that must die.

1100
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:17,868
You need to kill it, or I
promise you, it will kill you.

1101
01:37:18,947 --> 01:37:20,711
What are you doing? Billy?

1102
01:37:20,782 --> 01:37:24,285
I'm going back with you, to finish
the job and have done with it.

1103
01:37:24,286 --> 01:37:27,518
- You'll have the police all over us.
- Then do as you're told.

1104
01:37:27,588 --> 01:37:28,951
Do it now.

1105
01:37:39,799 --> 01:37:41,198
- Say it.
- Billy...

1106
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,298
- Say you're mine. You're mine. Say it.
- Billy, I can't.

1107
01:37:43,299 --> 01:37:45,234
- Yes, what?
- Yes, what?

1108
01:37:45,502 --> 01:37:47,333
Yes, I'm yours.

1109
01:38:30,375 --> 01:38:32,036
You startled me.

1110
01:38:33,445 --> 01:38:35,106
You took a long time.

1111
01:38:39,217 --> 01:38:41,248
What are you doing in the dark?

1112
01:38:41,285 --> 01:38:42,616
Thinking.

1113
01:38:43,252 --> 01:38:44,810
What are you thinking?

1114
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:50,923
I was thinking that if I ever
lost you, my life would be over.

1115
01:38:52,395 --> 01:38:54,927
There would be nothing left for me.

1116
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:57,657
Except to die.

1117
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:03,063
Don't say such things.

1118
01:39:04,906 --> 01:39:06,905
Did you find what you were looking for?

1119
01:39:06,906 --> 01:39:08,464
Yes, I did.

1120
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:11,535
I had to go all the way across town.

1121
01:39:16,015 --> 01:39:17,846
I'm going to go change.

1122
01:39:29,994 --> 01:39:33,729
Wash your hands and go to bed.
I'll bring the coffee.

1123
01:40:01,054 --> 01:40:02,487
There you are.

1124
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:19,731
How do they die, do you think?

1125
01:40:23,406 --> 01:40:24,896
- From the poison?
- Yes.

1126
01:40:26,242 --> 01:40:27,573
I don't know.

1127
01:40:32,614 --> 01:40:34,605
Lt's take a long time?

1128
01:40:37,351 --> 01:40:40,213
I suppose it depends on
how much you give them.

1129
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:42,081
That's right.

1130
01:40:45,091 --> 01:40:46,423
Is it painful?

1131
01:40:47,092 --> 01:40:49,726
I really don't want to think about it.

1132
01:40:52,197 --> 01:40:54,029
No, no, no, of course not.

1133
01:40:54,466 --> 01:40:59,193
We don't want our conscience
to get the best of us, do we?

1134
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:04,439
It's something that has to be done.

1135
01:41:05,143 --> 01:41:07,607
And when something has to be done...

1136
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:09,969
you do it.

1137
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:12,072
Is your coffee too hot?

1138
01:41:12,648 --> 01:41:13,979
I saw him.

1139
01:41:17,419 --> 01:41:18,750
Who?

1140
01:41:20,822 --> 01:41:22,312
I followed you.

1141
01:41:23,158 --> 01:41:24,556
You saw who? Where?

1142
01:41:25,826 --> 01:41:27,158
Julia.

1143
01:41:28,829 --> 01:41:31,197
Shall we... shall we just play the game...

1144
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:33,496
or just speak the truth?

1145
01:41:35,267 --> 01:41:36,097
No.

1146
01:41:36,501 --> 01:41:37,992
The truth is best.

1147
01:41:38,337 --> 01:41:39,827
All right, then.

1148
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:42,929
Is he here?

1149
01:41:44,943 --> 01:41:46,103
Yes.

1150
01:41:47,545 --> 01:41:48,705
Where?

1151
01:41:49,446 --> 01:41:52,480
Outside, waiting. When
I turn the lights off.

1152
01:41:52,949 --> 01:41:54,440
When I am dead?

1153
01:41:56,619 --> 01:41:57,780
Yes.

1154
01:42:02,225 --> 01:42:04,654
I... I led him to you in Havana, didn't I?

1155
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,550
Yes.

1156
01:42:07,963 --> 01:42:10,098
How'd he know I wouldn't kill you then?

1157
01:42:11,799 --> 01:42:14,660
He put blank cartridges in your gun.

1158
01:42:23,809 --> 01:42:25,141
Like a play.

1159
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,311
All of it.

1160
01:42:30,649 --> 01:42:31,980
Lies.

1161
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:35,253
From the moment I met you.

1162
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,152
Not all of it, no.

1163
01:42:38,489 --> 01:42:41,920
Do you laugh at me behind
my back, the two of you?

1164
01:42:44,261 --> 01:42:47,625
Do you laugh at me for how
stupid I have been? How...

1165
01:42:49,599 --> 01:42:50,930
How blind?

1166
01:42:52,869 --> 01:42:54,097
No.

1167
01:42:55,403 --> 01:42:57,936
Laugh now when I tell you this.

1168
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,071
L loved you, Julia.

1169
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:04,374
Julia is not here. Julia is dead.

1170
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:09,609
Laugh when I tell you
that I still love you.

1171
01:43:09,984 --> 01:43:10,972
No.

1172
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:13,217
No, not me.

1173
01:43:13,486 --> 01:43:14,783
You don't love me.

1174
01:43:15,087 --> 01:43:16,418
Oh, yes.

1175
01:43:17,589 --> 01:43:19,420
Oh, yes, you.

1176
01:43:20,759 --> 01:43:23,420
Not Julia Russell. Not...

1177
01:43:24,662 --> 01:43:26,251
Bonny Castle.

1178
01:43:27,531 --> 01:43:28,521
You.

1179
01:43:29,733 --> 01:43:31,764
L love you as I know you.

1180
01:43:32,235 --> 01:43:33,893
Because I know you.

1181
01:43:36,439 --> 01:43:37,770
As you are.

1182
01:43:39,775 --> 01:43:41,436
Good and bad.

1183
01:43:41,943 --> 01:43:43,707
Better and worse.

1184
01:43:47,215 --> 01:43:50,577
L told you this already,
but you didn't believe me.

1185
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:54,281
Tonight you will.

1186
01:43:56,557 --> 01:43:57,888
To us.

1187
01:44:00,325 --> 01:44:03,187
A short life and an exciting life.

1188
01:44:03,728 --> 01:44:05,390
Don't do this.

1189
01:44:06,564 --> 01:44:08,157
No other one.

1190
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:15,231
No other love but you.

1191
01:44:19,742 --> 01:44:21,108
From first to last.

1192
01:44:23,912 --> 01:44:25,504
Start to finish.

1193
01:44:29,785 --> 01:44:32,817
Don't change, Julia. Don't ever change.

1194
01:44:33,821 --> 01:44:35,331
No, no, no.

1195
01:44:35,332 --> 01:44:36,332
No!

1196
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:03,709
Let's go. You hold on.

1197
01:45:58,228 --> 01:45:59,558
Let's go.

1198
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,431
You disappoint me, Bonny.

1199
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:01,171
What do you think?

1200
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,643
Do you think those are real bullets?

1201
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:23,317
Do you speak English?

1202
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,895
- Do you speak English?
- Yes!

1203
01:47:25,235 --> 01:47:26,635
He needs a doctor.

1204
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:28,101
What about him?

1205
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:43,081
He's dead. He needs a doctor.

1206
01:47:43,151 --> 01:47:46,286
All right. I'm calling the police.

1207
01:47:53,494 --> 01:47:56,020
Stay, stay, stay.

1208
01:47:56,096 --> 01:47:58,928
I love you.

1209
01:47:59,432 --> 01:48:02,625
I love you. I love you. I love you.
Do you hear me?

1210
01:48:02,832 --> 01:48:06,231
- Say it. Say it again.
- I love you. I love you. I love you.

1211
01:48:06,232 --> 01:48:08,303
I love you. I love you.

1212
01:48:08,506 --> 01:48:10,667
I love you, Luis.

1213
01:48:11,691 --> 01:48:15,921
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1214
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,483
No. You hold on! Hold on!

1215
01:48:18,484 --> 01:48:19,484
No, no, no.

1216
01:48:21,217 --> 01:48:23,310
Don't go! Stay! Stay!

1217
01:48:23,553 --> 01:48:25,744
Please hold on. Please hold on.

1218
01:48:44,603 --> 01:48:49,638
And this is where the story
ends, at least for me.

1219
01:48:51,944 --> 01:48:54,105
Even though he is alive now...

1220
01:48:54,646 --> 01:48:56,578
how could I get to him?

1221
01:49:02,419 --> 01:49:04,251
Do you believe in forgiveness?

1222
01:49:06,689 --> 01:49:07,614
Yes.

1223
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,515
And redemption for the human soul?

1224
01:49:19,433 --> 01:49:20,593
Yes.

1225
01:49:21,135 --> 01:49:23,126
Even for someone like me?

1226
01:49:25,606 --> 01:49:26,767
Yes.

1227
01:49:28,074 --> 01:49:29,565
I believe so.

1228
01:49:29,566 --> 01:49:30,566
Well then,

1229
01:49:31,078 --> 01:49:34,007
I will see him in heaven, won't I?

1230
01:49:41,854 --> 01:49:43,117
Yes.

1231
01:49:46,691 --> 01:49:48,725
Will you hand me my shawl, please?

1232
01:49:48,726 --> 01:49:49,784
Yes, of course.

1233
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,432
Now pray with me.

1234
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:01,058
Yes.

1235
01:50:04,908 --> 01:50:07,570
I wore this on my wedding day.

1236
01:50:08,876 --> 01:50:12,068
But my heart was not in it then.

1237
01:51:03,223 --> 01:51:05,886
I'm sorry, ma'am. It is time.

1238
01:51:17,302 --> 01:51:18,792
If I may?

1239
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:23,601
What the hell!

1240
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:26,838
- It's the priest.
- But he left an hour ago.

1241
01:51:26,843 --> 01:51:28,070
I saw him.

1242
01:51:28,646 --> 01:51:30,978
Guards!

1243
01:52:07,445 --> 01:52:12,640
Well, I must say, it is a pleasure to
be in such lovely company for a change.

1244
01:52:12,783 --> 01:52:14,944
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

1245
01:52:15,286 --> 01:52:18,479
Thank you, gentlemen,
for letting me attend.

1246
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:27,925
And you, sir, may I say, it's a lucky man
who has found such a wife.

1247
01:52:30,799 --> 01:52:32,129
Yes, I am.

1248
01:52:35,469 --> 01:52:37,937
And perhaps, later on...

1249
01:52:38,005 --> 01:52:41,141
I will tell you the story
of how we came to be here.

1250
01:52:41,641 --> 01:52:43,279
It is an...

1251
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:46,236
interesting tale.

1252
01:52:46,812 --> 01:52:48,677
Some of it is even true.

1253
01:52:50,416 --> 01:52:52,747
But for now, all I can say...

1254
01:52:53,152 --> 01:52:55,683
is that from the moment I saw her...

1255
01:52:56,822 --> 01:52:58,220
I loved her.

1256
01:53:02,092 --> 01:53:04,253
And no matter the price...

1257
01:53:04,928 --> 01:53:07,789
you cannot walk away from love.

1258
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:12,626
Four.
