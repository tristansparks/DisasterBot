some very pretty verses.

00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:43,465
a Miss Bennet, and a Miss Bennet, sir.

348
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:44,966
Oh, for heaven's sake, are we to receive

349
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,010
every Bennet in the country?

350
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,474
What an excellent room you have, sir.

351
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,810
Such expensive furnishings.

352
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,898
Oh, I do hope you intend
to stay here, Mr. Bingley.

353
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,692
Absolutely. I find the country very diverting.

354
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,694
Don't you agree, Darcy?

355
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,030
I find it perfectly adequate,

356
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,033
even if society's
a little less varied than in town.

357
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,952
MRS. BENNET: Less varied? Not at all.

358
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,789
We dine with four and twenty
families of all shapes and sizes.

359
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,335
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man

360
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:24,839
and a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

361
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,717
LYDIA: Mr. Bingley, is it true
that you've promised

362
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,220
- to hold a ball here at Netherfield?
- A ball?

363
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,722
It would be an excellent way
to meet new friends.

364
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,350
You could invite the militia.
They're excellent company.

365
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,435
- Oh, do hold a ball.
- ELIZABETH: Kitty.

366
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,314
When your sister is recovered,
you shall name the day.

367
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,650
I think a ball is a perfectly irrational way

368
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,235
to gain new acquaintance.

369
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,321
It would be better if conversation,
instead of dancing,

370
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,739
were the order of the day.

371
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,951
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

372
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,578
Thank you, Mary.

373
00:24:56,746 --> 00:25:00,792
MRS. BENNET: What a fine, imposing place
it is, to be sure, is it not, my dears?

374
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,962
There's no house to equal it in the county.

375
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,339
- Mr. Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

376
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,716
There she is.

377
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,592
Mr. Bingley, I don't know how to thank you.

378
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,387
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

379
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,264
Thank you for your stimulating company.

380
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,849
It has been most instructive.

381
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,351
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

382
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,441
- Mr. Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

383
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,831
And then, there was one
with great long lashes like a cow.

384
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,708
LYDIA: Did you see him?
He looked right at me.

385
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,544
MRS. BENNET: Ask Mrs. Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

386
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,130

I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

389
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:58,016
I have reason to expect an addition
to our family party.

390
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,019
ELIZABETH: His name is Mr. Collins.
He's the dreaded cousin.

391
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,064
- CHARLOTTE: Who's to inherit.
- Indeed. Everything, apparently.

392
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,900
Even my piano stool belongs to Mr. Collins.

393
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,026
When?

394
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,111
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

395
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,446
But why?

396
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,908
Because the estate passes directly
to him and not to us poor females.

397
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,290
Mr. Collins, at your service.

398
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:35,845
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent boiled potatoes.

399
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:40,225
Many years since I've had
such an exemplary vegetable.

To which of my fair cousins

401
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,896
should I compliment the excellence
of the cooking?

402
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,149
Mr. Collins, we are perfectly able
to keep a cook.

403
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,567
COLLINS: Excellent.

404
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,196
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

405
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,077
I am honoured to have as my patroness,

406
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,829
Lady Catherine de Bourg.

407
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,705
You've heard of her, I presume?

408
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:07,794
My small rectory abuts her estate,

409
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,797
Rosings Park, and she often condescends

410
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,593
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

411
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,471
Does she have any family?

412
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:22,475
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

413
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,603
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

414
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,815
that her daughter seemed born
to be a duchess,

415
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:33,236
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

416
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,656
These are the kind of
little delicate compliments

417
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,366
which are always acceptable to the ladies

418
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:43,079
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

419
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,874
BENNET: How happy for you, Mr. Collins,

420
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:49,586
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

421
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,798
Do these pleasing attentions proceed from

422
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,341
the impulse of the moment

423
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,802
or are they the result of previous study?

424
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,180
COLLINS: They arise chiefly
from what is passing at the time,

425
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,848
and though I do sometimes amuse myself

426
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,475
with arranging
such little elegant compliments,

427
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:09,397
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

428
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,151

your manners to be rehearsed.

But Miss Lizzie, next to her
in both age and beauty,

449
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,845
would make anyone an excellent partner.

00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,021

00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,973
With his last breath,

518
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,560
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

519
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,897
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the church.

520
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,734
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

521
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,320
- But why?
- Jealousy.

522
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,240
His father...

523
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,411
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

524
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,415
- How cruel.
- So now, I'm a poor foot soldier,

525
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,751
too lowly even to be noticed.

I still think there must have been
a misunderstanding.

533

Oh, Jane, do you never think ill of anybody?

534
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,293
Well, how could Mr. Darcy do such a thing?

535
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,755
I'll discover the truth from Mr. Bingley

536
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:08,881
at the ball this evening.

537
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,884
If it is not true,
let Mr. Darcy contradict it himself.

538
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,262
Till he does, I hope never to encounter him.

539

Poor, unfortunate Mr. Wickham.

540
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,433

Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

a rather more willing dancer.

- to see you again, Mr. Bingley.
- Mrs. Bennet.

547

- Miss Bingley.
- Charming.

- I'm so pleased you're here.
- So am I.

549

And how are you?

550
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,544
Miss Elizabeth,
are you looking for someone?

551
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,755
No. No, not at all.

552
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,965
I was just admiring the general splendour.

553
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,468
It is breath-taking, Mr. Bingley.

554
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,677
Good.

555
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:49,190
MRS. BENNET: You might at least have
passed a few pleasantries with Mr. Bingley.

556
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,193
I dare say I've never met
a more pleasant gentleman

558
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:55,821
Did you see how he dotes on her?

Dear Jane. Always doing
what's best for her family.

560
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,346
- Charlotte.
- Lizzie.

561
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:24,684
- Have you seen Mr. Wickham?
- No, perhaps he is through here.

562
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,074
Lizzie. Mr. Wickham is not here.

563
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,118
Apparently he's been detained.

564
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,287
Detained where? He must be here.

565
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,123
There you are.

00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:53,003
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth?

568
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,967
I did not think you danced, Mr. Collins.

569
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,261
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman

570
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,722
to indulge in such an innocent diversion.

571

Her Ladyship included,

has been called on some business to town.

576
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,597
To be sure, dancing is of
little consequence to me,

577
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,348
but it does...

578
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,769
It does harbour the opportunity to lavish...

579
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,816
To lavish upon one's partner...

580

You may.

596

Did I just agree to dance with Mr. Darcy?

I daresay you will find him
very amiable, Lizzie.

598
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,289
It would be most inconvenient,

599
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,542
since I have sworn
to loathe him for all eternity.

- Indeed. Most invigorating.

It is your turn to say something,
Mr. Darcy.

604
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,322
I talked about the dance,
now you ought to remark

605
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:28,158
on the size of the room
or the number of couples.

606

I am perfectly happy to oblige.

Please advise me
of what you would like most to hear.

608

That reply will do for present.

609
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,089
Perhaps by and by,
I may observe that private balls

610
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,466
are much pleasanter
than public ones.

611

For now we may remain silent.

while dancing?

No.

614
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,946
No, I prefer to be unsociable
and taciturn.

don't you think?

Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less certain.

He's been so unfortunate
as to lose your friendship.

that is an irreversible event?

But before I am run away
with my feelings,

727
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,831
perhaps I may state my reasons
for marrying.

728
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,417
Firstly, that it is the duty
of a clergyman

729
00:47:57,501 --> 00:48:00,295
to set the example of matrimony
in his parish.

730
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:04,341
Secondly, that I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

731
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,886
And thirdly, that it is
at the urging

732
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:10,555
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

733
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,891
that I select a wife.

734
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:17,354
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

735
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,106
from among Mr. Bennet's daughters,

736
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:23,068
for I am to inherit the estate,

737
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,238
and such an alliance will surely

738
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,323
suit everyone.

739
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,495
And now,
nothing remains but for me

740
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,956
to assure you in the most
animated language,

741
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,249
of the violence of my affections.

742
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:38,458

743
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:40,710
And that no reproach
on the subject of fortune

744

once we're married.

00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:45,132
You are too hasty, sir. You forget
that I have given no answer.

I must add that Lady Catherine
will thoroughly approve

747

when I speak to her of your modesty,
economy, and other

748

to seem too eager...

00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,864
You could not make me happy

I plan many improvements, of course.

Do not make yourself uneasy,
my dear cousin, about your apparel.

891
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:25,336
Just put on whatever you've brought
that's best.

Lady Catherine's never been averse
to the truly humble.

One of the most extraordinary sights
in all of Europe, is it not?

could you get me a fish course?

- Not one.
- That's very strange.

01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,917
I suppose you had no opportunity.

932
01:01:10,168 --> 01:01:12,336
Your mother should've taken you
to town every spring

for the benefit of the masters.

934
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:17,800
I'm sure my mother wouldn't have
minded, but my father hates town.

- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

I never heard such a thing.

939
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,356
Your mother must have been
quite a slave to your education.

Yes, my youngest is not 16.

948

But I think it would be very hard
on younger sisters

949
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:01,010
not to have their share
of amusement

950
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,137
because the elder
is still unmarried.

951
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:06,182
It would hardly encourage
sisterly affection.

Upon my word,

953
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:10,478

would have allowed her.

01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:35,052

1037
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:39,515
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

1038
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:41,684
From what I heard
on our journey here,

1039
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:44,395
he recently came to the rescue
of one of his friends just in time.

1040
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:45,646
What happened?

1041
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,565
He saved the man
from an imprudent marriage.

1042
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:48,816
Who was the man?

1043
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:57,032
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

1044
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:03,330
Did Mr. Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

1045
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:06,667
There were apparently strong
objections to the lady.

1046
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:09,003
What kind of objections?

1047
01:08:09,295 --> 01:08:10,504
Her lack of fortune?

1048
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:14,049
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

1049
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:17,636
So he separated them.

1050
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,014

and I am very sorry to have
caused you pain.

1070

Believe me,
it was unconsciously done.

1071
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,841
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

1072
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:40,260
Are you laughing at me?

- No.
- Are you rejecting me?

I'm sure that the feelings which,
as you've told me,

1075
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:46,767
have hindered your regard
will help you in overcoming it.

1076
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:48,852
Might I ask why,

1077
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:51,105
with so little endeavour at civility,
I am thus repulsed?

1078
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:52,606
And I might as well enquire why,

with so evident a design
of insulting me,

1080
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,651

Do you deny it, Mr. Darcy?

1089
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:14,461
That you separated a young couple
who loved each other,

1090
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,839
exposing your friend to the centre
of the world for caprice

1091

for disappointed hopes.

I do not deny it.

How could you do it?

1095
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:27,433
Because I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

1096
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:28,559
Indifferent?

1097
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:29,727
I watched them most carefully

1098
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,311
and realise his attachment
was deeper than hers.

1099
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:32,396
That's because she's shy.

1100
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:33,480
Bingley, too, is modest

1101
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:35,107
and was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly for him.

1102
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:37,234
- Because you suggested it.
- I did it for his own good.

1103

her true feelings to me!

that his fortune had some bearing...

It was made perfectly clear
that an advantageous marriage...

- No! No!

01:54:28,112 --> 01:54:30,281
it is I who should be making amends.

1708
01:54:31,032 --> 01:54:34,952
You must know. Surely you must know
it was all for you.

1709
01:54:38,539 --> 01:54:41,084
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1710
01:54:41,667 --> 01:54:43,544
I believe you spoke with my aunt last night

1711
01:54:43,628 --> 01:54:45,296
and it has taught me to hope

1712
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,924
as I had scarcely allowed myself before.

1713
01:54:49,467 --> 01:54:51,511
If your feelings are still
what they were last April,

1714
01:54:51,594 --> 01:54:53,054
tell me so at once.

1715
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:57,225
My affections and wishes have not changed,

1716
01:54:57,975 --> 01:55:00,895
but one word from you
will silence me forever.

1717
01:55:06,317 --> 01:55:10,154
If, however, your feelings have changed,

1718
01:55:13,241 --> 01:55:17,912
I would have to tell you, you have
bewitched me, body and soul,

1719
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:21,833
and I love... I love... I love you.

1720
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:25,169
I never wish to be parted from you
from this day on.

1721
01:55:36,764 --> 01:55:38,099
Well, then.

1722
01:55:43,229 --> 01:55:44,981
Your hands are cold.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

1724
01:56:30,276 --> 01:56:32,403
BENNET: Shut the door, please, Elizabeth.

1725
01:56:43,414 --> 01:56:45,750
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?

1726
01:56:46,667 --> 01:56:48,753
I thought you hated the man.

1727
01:56:49,045 --> 01:56:50,254
No, Papa.

1728
01:56:51,255 --> 01:56:53,841
He's rich, to be sure,

1729
01:56:53,925 --> 01:56:57,011
and you will have
more fine carriages than Jane.

1730
01:56:57,970 --> 01:56:59,931
But will that make you happy?

1731
01:57:00,973 --> 01:57:04,644
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1732
01:57:05,228 --> 01:57:06,604
None at all.

1733
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:11,442
Well, we all know him to be a proud,
unpleasant sort of fellow,

1734
01:57:12,985 --> 01:57:15,029
but this would be nothing
if you really liked him.

1735
01:57:15,112 --> 01:57:16,864
- I do like him.
- Well.

1736
01:57:19,116 --> 01:57:20,451
I love him.

1737
01:57:24,163 --> 01:57:28,918
He's not proud. I was wrong,
I was entirely wrong about him.

1738
01:57:32,129 --> 01:57:33,214
You don't know him, Papa.

1739
01:57:33,297 --> 01:57:36,842
If I told you what he was
really like, what he's done.

1740
01:57:37,885 --> 01:57:39,470
What has he done?

1741

(HENS CLUCKING)

1742

KITTY: Mary, look at him.

1743
01:57:47,645 --> 01:57:48,604
But he's so...

1744
01:57:48,688 --> 01:57:52,066
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1745
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:54,151
So did I. So did we all.

1746
01:57:55,653 --> 01:57:57,613
We must have been wrong.

1747
01:57:58,573 --> 01:58:00,324
Wouldn't be the first time, will it?

1748
01:58:00,408 --> 01:58:01,409
(LAUGHING) No.

1749
01:58:01,867 --> 01:58:03,869
Nor the last, I dare say.

1750
01:58:09,667 --> 01:58:11,002
Good Lord.

1751
01:58:14,005 --> 01:58:16,674
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1752
01:58:18,009 --> 01:58:20,970
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1753
01:58:22,555 --> 01:58:25,099
We misjudged him, Papa,
me more than anyone,

1754
01:58:25,683 --> 01:58:28,352
in every way, not just in this matter.

1755
01:58:29,937 --> 01:58:31,814
I've been nonsensical.

1756
01:58:32,857 --> 01:58:36,193
But he's been a fool about Jane,

1757
01:58:36,485 --> 01:58:38,613
about so many other things.

1758
01:58:40,364 --> 01:58:41,574
But then, so have I.

1759
01:58:44,285 --> 01:58:47,288
You see, he and I are...

1760
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:51,500
He and I are so similar.

1761
01:58:53,044 --> 01:58:54,962
(LAUGHING) We're both so stubborn.

1762
01:58:57,923 --> 01:58:59,216

01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:05,723
You really do love him, don't you?

1765
01:59:07,224 --> 01:59:08,517
Very much.

I cannot believe
that anyone can deserve you,

1768
01:59:19,945 --> 01:59:22,782
but it seems I am overruled.

1769
01:59:24,575 --> 01:59:28,412
So I heartily give my consent.

1770
01:59:37,338 --> 01:59:39,924
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie,

1771
01:59:40,549 --> 01:59:42,093

If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,

1775

for heaven's sake, send them in,
I'm quite at my leisure.
