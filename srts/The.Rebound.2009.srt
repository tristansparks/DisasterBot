1
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,031
Every fucking morning.

2
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:45,932
- I heard that.
- No, you didn't.

3
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:47,727
- Yes I did.
- I did too.

4
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:51,897
Hey, Sandy, what the hell.

5
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,622
- Mom!
- It's just for germs, they're for enemy.

6
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,018
- Good luck in your test.
- And I need luck.

7
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:03,500
- [Mumbles], Mom.
- I'm sorry.

8
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:09,115
Have a great day.
And remember, own your own power.

9
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:11,469
You're a powerful little cheek rocket

10
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:14,215
Sorry.

11
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:16,765
Don't forget to bring the DVD
from my birthday.

12
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:19,599
I told Lizzie she's not bringing it
for show and tell tomorrow.

13
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,712
- Do I ever forget anything?
- Just do it! Ok, Mom?

14
00:01:25,598 --> 00:01:26,348
Go!

15
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:32,631
Welcome to the Frank Magic Jr.
6th birthday celebration.

16
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:35,758
- We have many famous guests.
Famous. Well, we're here.

17
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,189
Cute.

18
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,513
Yeah, that's it.

19
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:19,473
Oh, Molly, Molly.

20
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:21,356
Molly Foster?!

21
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:24,982
You're a magician.
A little magician.

22
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,541
Love knowing Sandy's in the next room.

23
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:39,227
Molly. Yes, Molly.

24
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:42,839
Oh, my God!

25
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,678
Mom I don't understand why
we have to move into the city?

26
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:56,380
The city is the center of everything guys
It will be a fresh start.

27
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,060
Dad said that only minorities and
adventured capitalists live in the city.

28
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,661
And now we do too.

29
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:23,747
Are we gonna meet any transvestites?

30
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,378
What's a transvestite?

31
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:28,550
It is a person who has a penis
and a vagina and they live in the city.

32
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,751
That's not what it is.

33
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:34,067
Alright, guys, it's the place.

34
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:36,283
I really have to pee.

35
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,714
Can you hold it a little longer?

36
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,176
Welcome to New York City.

37
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:43,771
We're only here because
our parents are getting a divorce.

38
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,249
Not to sight-seeing or see Phantom of the Opera

39
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,062
- Sadie.
- You know I have read about this.

40
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:51,546
It's fairly typical behavior for
children of divorced.

41
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,729
How about taking the bags?

42
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,167
Mom, check this out! We're
writing our names.

43
00:04:57,668 --> 00:04:59,567
Oh God!

44
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:06,032
Well, you can't mope around for
the rest of your life.

45
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:10,325
It's only been three weeks, mom.
Just give me some time.

46
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,561
Oh, such a smart girl.

47
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:16,542
But she never graduated college,
and you hated her.

48
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,635
But the French, she spoke it so beautifully.

49
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:21,118
She was from there.

50
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:25,330
She was a Finklestein,
It's hard not to love a Finklestein.

51
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:28,927
Anyway, I spoke to your cousin Ruth,
and she arranged a job interview,

52
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:31,797
Women's Center, where she used to work,
Get you out of your funk.

53
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,319
I have a job,
at the coffee shop.

54
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:37,549
Oh, it's depressing and you're a college
graduate, Aram, for crying out loud.

55
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:41,421
You will finally put that Ladies Studies
major of yours to good use.

56
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:44,676
It's a minor, Dad
and it's called sociology.

57
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,664
BA from Stanford
MA in journalism from Northwestern.

58
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:52,289
You do realize that this is
a fact-checking job?

59
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:55,976
I have been raising two kids, and

60
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,527
Well, the truth is...
I'm getting divorced.

61
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:05,804
And I'm sure I will be good at this
because I'm very organized.

62
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:11,952
I love sports,
well not hockey, so much.

63
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:17,053
You see, once the kids were born
I decided to stay home for a while.

64
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:21,909
Which was OK, because you know,
babies take up a lot of time.

65
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,826
Maybe you don't know.

66
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:30,210
Anyway, eventually they went to school

67
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,164
and I started having more time on my hands.

68
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:36,451
And I compiled these
stat books,

69
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:39,481
and made up this graphing system.

70
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,082
Yeah, hmm.

71
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,693
How?

72
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:02,528
Just time,
and a great satellite TV package.

73
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:08,873
Aram Finklestein, that's
a Jewish name, right?

74
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:17,998
What are your feelings
about women, Aram?

75
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:21,160
Are you kidding?
I think they're great up until...

76
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:26,772
Recently I was planning on spending the rest
of my life with a woman.

77
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,469
Not that I wanted to spend it
with a man, I just...

78
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:35,775
This one experience with a woman, not a man

79
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:44,098
kinda took away my faith in...
Well, I guess, everything.

80
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:50,535
Aram, I know you took some Women's studies
courses in college.

81
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:54,100
But other than that, do you have
any kind of experience

82
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,924
that you think might have
prepared you for this job?

83
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:04,590
I used to buy
tampons for my mother.

84
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:09,230
You will fit in perfectly, yes.

85
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:14,097
Thought I met my soul mate.

86
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,402
You met a really hot French girl
who needed a green card.

87
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,816
- She was just so...
- Hot.

88
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,897
- It wasn't that.
- Sexy.

89
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:26,009
It was something else. She needed me.

90
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,881
Yes, to get a green card.

91
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:31,981
There's gotta be more meaning
to it all than this.

92
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:36,929
You know living at your parents place isn't
exactly... grab a life by the balls you know.

93
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,660
I'm saving up.

94
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,713
I hate to tell you this but...
you work in a coffee shop.

95
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:47,069
And your hot French wife
left you for her brother.

96
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,580
Stop it.

97
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,822
Can I get you something?

98
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,490
Yeah, this ad says...
you have an apartment for rent?

99
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,923
Yeah, the owner has a loft upstairs

100
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:59,721
Which I would be happy to show you.

101
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:02,722
- Sure.
- Cool.

102
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,323
[Whispering].
MILF. 

103
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:08,302
I'm Mitchell, and this right here is Aram.
What's MILF, I donot know.

104
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,717
He's trying to figure out the meaning of life.

105
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:15,305
He also is a wonderful babysitter
if you ever need one.

106
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,027
Just a perk of the apartment.

107
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:20,960
- Hey, little guys.
- Mom, I do not want to live here.

108
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,322
I want my own room. How many more
apartment do we have to look at?

109
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:32,909
- I got an apartment.
- You're fast.

110
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:37,515
It's not great, but my husband
won't be there so that's a plus.

111
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,786
How are you so well adjusted?

112
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:43,140
All those years with the PTA,
I don't have a choice.

113
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,913
How's the job search?

114
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:47,680
I got one, fact check for SNN.

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,503
You are unbelievable,
you're almost fully healed.

116
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:55,783
You know everyone says what a nightmare it
is to get divorced you're bad, I feel good.

117
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,149
No residual or anything?

118
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:01,471
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

119
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:03,994
Trapped in some suburban hell, same thing

120
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,987
day after day like a
"hamster in a wheel.

121
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,720
Up on your feet, let's ride to happiness.

122
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,229
All you need now to
complete the healing is to get laid.

123
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,891
Oh no, that's one thing
I'm not ready for.

124
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,011
Look I don't expect you
to fall in love with this guy.

125
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:22,247
This guy?
Oh, no! What have you done?

126
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,319
A chiropractor, who fixed me up with
that whole elevator shaft thing.

127
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:29,007
Anyway, he smells great, and went
to an Ivy League College.

128
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,021
- Where?
- Santa Barbara.

129
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,685
That's not Ivy League.

130
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,987
Well, he's in great shape,
and he has a country house.

131
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,543
And I already told him all about you.

132
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:39,746
Wait, I think that's the kid
who showed me the apartment.

133
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,682
The one that tried to kiss you?

134
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,521
No, he just works
in the coffee shop right below.

135
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,372
- Too bad, he's cute.
- Yeah like 10.

136
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:49,358
Nice ass, Coffee boy.

137
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:57,272
Just go out with my
chiropractor, and have a good time

138
00:10:57,272 --> 00:11:00,583
maybe screw him, you know, that's seems right.

139
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:08,029
Why are you here?
It's been three weeks.

140
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,772
I came to see you.

141
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,401
Have fun.

142
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:42,073
There's this huge kid,
and he has like so much fat on him.

143
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:46,671
He sat at me at gym class, and told me
who would change my name to Pablo.

144
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:50,953
Frankie, that is terrible, are you okay sweetie?.
it's Pablo.

145
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:52,383
and yes, it was fun.

146
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:55,032
- So, listen...
- Oh, uh.

147
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:57,893
- What?
- Whenever you say, "So, listen,"

148
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:59,531
is always something weird.

149
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:02,809
It's not weird, it's just that I'm
thinking about going on a date.

150
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:05,521
I don't know, what I really want to but I,

151
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:08,595
I think it will be a positive step for me..

152
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:11,484
But I just wanted to see how
you guys would feel about it..

153
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:13,184
Are you gonna have sex with them?

154
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:14,907
That's an inappropriate question..

155
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:25,768
Hey guys, you know,
if we're gonna live in the city,

156
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:28,349
we're gonna have to learn to deal
with these kind of stuff ok.

157
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:32,427
So just stick with me and be polite.

158
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,590
- Hello
- Hi

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,854
Thanks you for coming in on
such short notice.

160
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:47,597
I won't normally put you on
this type of situation,

161
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:50,523
without some training,
but we're really in a vine.

162
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:53,660
Whatever I can do to help. Ok, great,
now why don't you put your suit on.

163
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,280
And then meet me at the activities room.

164
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,990
- A suit?
- Yeah, it's in the closet behind you.

165
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,949
Now try to hurry, self-defense class
starts exactly at 5:30.

166
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,278
Mommy, why do you have to do this?

167
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,429
Because now that we live in New York
we're gonna all kinds of different people.

168
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:10,353
and we need to know
how to deal with them.

169
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:12,144
Like the man with the penis?

170
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:18,862
So you're walking down the street,
and all of a sudden you hear...

171
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:23,163
hey, sweet lips, I like that ass.

172
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:27,309
Hey mommy, why don't you come over here,
sit on my face...?

173
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:31,702
Hey, kid, how would like
to make a quick $ 100?

174
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:35,312
Yes, sure. No, you don't kid,
you don't want that money.

175
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:39,275
Self-preservation 
in a city of predators.

176
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:42,575
That's what you will learn in here.

177
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,920
Let's meet our perpetrator.

178
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:50,158
Hi

179
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:58,765
No words perp
unless they're scripted.

180
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,071
Begin scenario eight.

181
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:13,391
Hey, sweet lips.

182
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,208
Scenario 3.

183
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:23,854
Hey, baby, that should be illegal.

184
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:31,283
5.

185
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:36,534
Mrs. Sanchez, it appears you have
a yeast infection,

186
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:42,616
and an unbelievable set of tits.

187
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,860
For our last exercise,
I am going to demonstrate

188
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,467
what I call, "Ocean of anger. "

189
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,848
Hold on, because we are about to go deep.

190
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,829
All of us as
women have developed

191
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:04,755
a reservoir of resentment and anger.

192
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:09,208
And these reservoirs put together
form an ocean,

193
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:14,722
and this ocean is available
for all us to draw from.

194
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:19,245
It holds the collective power
of every women,

195
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:24,233
who has ever been wronged
in an inappropriate sexual remark

196
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:28,798
being underpaid for a
job you have done better than a man,

197
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,815
ancestor who was a slave.

198
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:38,381
Or rice picker, or simply

199
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:40,356
lowman on the totem pole.

200
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:46,743
A husband who has wronged you,
who has cheated and lied to you,

201
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,338
or you, or you, or you.

202
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:54,115
- I'm a lesbian.
- See me after class.

203
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:59,698
All of this anger is present
in all of you, right now and always.

204
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,257
I need a volunteer.

205
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,064
Mom!

206
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,260
Don't!

207
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:20,214
You are going to call upon this history

208
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:25,057
and unleash the ocean of anger on our perf.

209
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,952
May I, just need a quick bathroom break?

210
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:30,292
Zip it, perv.
Tell him to zip it.

211
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:35,701
- Zip it, perv.
- Again, good, louder.

212
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:48,901
Zip it, perv.

213
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:52,674
Now tell him what
you wanna tell him.

214
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,530
Dirty little fucking scumbag.

215
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,614
take your diseased riddled whore
and fuck her in hell

216
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:11,279
for all eternity,

217
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,020
May the devil burn you,

218
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,072
with hot jagged metal,

219
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:21,959
and suffocate you with molten fury.

220
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,354
Now, unleash!.

221
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:29,955
Oh my God.

222
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:32,237
Is there a safe word I should be aware of?

223
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,147
Time out.

224
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,375
My life was never gonna be this way

225
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,635
It's okay.

226
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,326
I know you.

227
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:29,090
I don't see how getting beat up
by a bunch of chicks everyday

228
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,852
is getting you any closer
to the meaning of his life.

229
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:34,209
I'm helping people,
I'm contributing to the world.

230
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:37,395
Not like an actor.

231
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:41,715
Buddy, I reflect life back unto itself, ok?

232
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:46,698
Thereby, taking mirror,
like a theatre mirror.

233
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:55,330
- Look at you.
- Oh, it's not as bad as it feels.

234
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,651
My mom was sorry she beat you up so bad.

235
00:18:57,651 --> 00:18:59,397
Thank you, Frankie.

236
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:02,435
Don't worry about it,
your mom didn't beat me up.

237
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:03,736
I have been going through a lot...

238
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:06,075
- Can I get a blueberry muffin...?
- Not right now sweetheart.

239
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:09,609
I have been going through a lot recently
I didn't realize how much it was affecting me.

240
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,699
- Don't worry about it.
- Just saying sorry.

241
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,942
- I pick it up.
- I helped.

242
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:16,940
If palm gets squeezed into it, you could die.

243
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,989
I was wondering
if I could take you up on your offer

244
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:22,568
to baby-sit.

245
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,021
If it still holds, that is.

246
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:27,502
I don't really... I mean, I haven't
you know in a little while...

247
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:30,796
I figured since they,
hired at the Women's Center,

248
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,129
You must be trustworthy.

249
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,645
I guess I could pop upstairs
some day after work for a couple of hours.

250
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,545
Would Thursday work?

251
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:44,190
- She has a date.
- With a big pimp.

252
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,859
Where do you learn this stuff?

253
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:53,398
Olivia at school taught me, she's
my hell, we play.

254
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,354
What ever happened to kickball.

255
00:19:57,889 --> 00:20:00,150
Would 7 o'clock be okay?

256
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,303
Oh, great.

257
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:11,853
There are times when the lost
must be found,

258
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:15,973
and other times when the lost
must find themselves.

259
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:17,595
Very well said Rabbi.

260
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:22,513
Not that he's a bad little boy just
misguided, falling in with the wrong crowd.

261
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,656
Are you talking about me? I only hang out
with you and Dad?

262
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:31,963
The battles are not only fought on
the battlefield, Roberto but also in the soul.

263
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:34,152
My soul is fine. Great.

264
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:36,312
What does his future hold?

265
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:38,318
Mom, he's not a palm reader.

266
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,499
A new job is in order.

267
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:47,168
Luckily, my cousin is a head hunter
are you interested in business, Aram?

268
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:47,918
Yes

269
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:51,919
Kids, your babysitter's here.
Come say hello.

270
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,068
Sadie usually goes to bed a bit later than Frankie,

271
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:57,504
but due to her unscheduled
emergency surgery

272
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,191
she will be going to bed the same time.
- Oh my God.

273
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:04,744
Are you sure I should be staying with
her after she just had surgery?

274
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,156
This was her surgery.

275
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:15,841
I told you it was dead
when I found it.

276
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,473
Yes, but I highly doubt
its organs have been harvested.

277
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:21,680
- I hate you.
- Can I play Wii?

278
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,064
For half an hour.

279
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,351
- You're gonna be okay, right?
- Yeah

280
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:31,616
Truth is, I didn't know if I want to go on this date,

281
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:33,734
it's just my friend, she's kinda

282
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:37,064
forcing me. She thinks I need to get laid.

283
00:21:39,184 --> 00:21:41,184
Release some tension.

284
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:46,602
Do I look okay? Everything's in order.

285
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:49,950
It seems to be.

286
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,782
- Goodbye, Frankie.
- Bye.

287
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:05,556
- Hey Frank.
- Call me Pablo.

288
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,890
He also had some cranial seizures as well as TMJ.

289
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,668
So what did you do?

290
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,677
I went right home and I took out my skeleton.

291
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:22,226
- Your skeleton?
- It's really as weird as it sounds.

292
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:27,083
I have this bone replica skeleton, keep it
the house and I use it to figure stuff out.

293
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:31,122
This way I can put it in different positions
and see how they affect his bone structure.

294
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:34,410
- It's a him?
- Yes it's him.

295
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,388
Thought it would be weird if it was a her.

296
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:41,202
That way people might think
I'm seeing somebody,

297
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:45,523
and it might actually drive away
beautiful women like you.

298
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,604
I am a mom.

299
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:50,434
Why did I say that?

300
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:52,987
It's okay, it's alright, I know. It's true.

301
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:57,942
You are a mom.
And you are incredibly beautiful.

302
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:01,128
You have excellent posture.

303
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,296
Excuse me for just a second.

304
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:36,794
You haven't told me much about yourself.

305
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:38,930
My God.

306
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:46,509
- Hello
- I'm here.

307
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,668
I thought I'd lost you for a second.

308
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:59,580
No, I grew up just outside
San Francisco.

309
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,559
That's a great town.

310
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,397
Do you have any hobby?

311
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:11,364
Just take care of my kids.

312
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:14,440
No, no, that's not

313
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,400
a hobby.

314
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:23,316
I used to like to windsurf.

315
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:26,606
Longboard? Shortboard?
Ocean, lake, what?

316
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,747
Lake, mostly lake.

317
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:33,209
I competed when I was younger.

318
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,932
Competed in windsurfing,
That's impressing.

319
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:46,153
So?

320
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:49,403
You.. like the beautiful you, you

321
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:56,554
You are fascinating.

322
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,579
What's your normal job?

323
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:04,984
- I work at the coffee shop.
- I mean your real job?

324
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,451
It is my real job.

325
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:09,226
but you are in the blowup suit too.

326
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:11,434
That was just once, I quit there.

327
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:14,323
- Didn't you go to college?
- Yes

328
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:17,065
I hope I will have a real job
by the time I'm your age.

329
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:20,221
Knockout!.

330
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,331
The Pablo man had knocked you out.

331
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:26,747
So are we gonna have fun tonight or you're
gonna be one of those boring babysitters?

332
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:28,914
Hey guys, it's me.

333
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:35,017
I don't know why you're not picking up,
Anyway, I hope everything's okay.

334
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:39,174
Yeah, ok, bye.

335
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:42,037
Worried about the kids, huh

336
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:52,100
My new babysitter have not much experience yet.

337
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:54,903
I know exactly what you need.

338
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,490
See, we all hold our
tension somewhere.

339
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:04,032
For you, it's in your shoulders,

340
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:10,217
and just a little bit in your ass.

341
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,912
There's much experience as I have...

342
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:18,889
can tell just by the way
as people walk...

343
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:25,937
and even by the way they smile.

344
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:36,442
No charge.

345
00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:45,202
This thing got my arm.

346
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,518
I'm running through the forest.

347
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:54,753
Leave me one arm,
please don't...

348
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:00,066
I will get claustrophobic wearing human skin mask.

349
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,303
You couldn't even wear
a hulk mask last Halloween.

350
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:04,824
That's because it was hot and it smelled bad.

351
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,335
- That was your breath, retard.
- Sadie...

352
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,158
- Actually...
- Come on, you don't need to do...

353
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,859
It's 11 o'clock.

354
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:12,850
Got to get you to bed
before your mom comes home.

355
00:27:15,324 --> 00:27:17,351
- Tell us about the "Exorcist".
- Okay.

356
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:18,816
I don't feel so good.

357
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:20,564
I might throw up.

358
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:23,973
This chocolate bar is bigger than you

359
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:26,574
If you're gonna throw up, can't we do it
before your mom gets home, please.

360
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:29,531
I always throw up when mentioning
throw up, and before a girl.

361
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,780
I love throw ups.

362
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,678
- Eew, you love to eat throw up?
- Sadie.

363
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:35,024
What?

364
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:38,339
You're gonna freak him out
you're getting us all in trouble.

365
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:40,471
You know actually I feels sick.., Frankie?

366
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,756
- That was nice, listen
- What?.

367
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:46,904
Eating a raw skinned pigeon
with mustard and rotten milk,

368
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:50,313
just chewing on those intestines
and those little bones..

369
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:52,336
Okay, off to bed, come on... Yummy

370
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,101
Touch my cock.

371
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:06,263
Stop the car.

372
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:14,156
- You have a problem.
- I have a problem?

373
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,416
Thanks for offering.

374
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:35,999
I'd love to tell you.

375
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:44,403
In a taxi. It seems like the perfect place.

376
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,112
Hobby

377
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,445
Home making.

378
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:10,304
How could this happen to me?
Do you ever wonder that?

379
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:14,197
How could I have floated so far

380
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:19,804
off the path I thought I was on?

381
00:29:19,804 --> 00:29:22,730
I just thought maybe

382
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:28,261
it would be some meaning to my life.

383
00:29:33,514 --> 00:29:35,576
I'm not making any sense.

384
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,657
Maybe you will come back again

385
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:53,120
because I think the kids could really
use some continuity.

386
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,842
Shit.

387
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:05,337
I have no fucking money.
Can you believe that ?

388
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:08,041
Can I pay you tomorrow?

389
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,695
It's no problem.

390
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:23,041
Hey it's you, eating a croissant.

391
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:26,042
French chick must be fading, huh.

392
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:29,049
- Don't change the music.
- What, they're shitty music.. oops?

393
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,786
- What do you think about kids?
- I think about making them all the time.

394
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:39,016
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What are you talking about?

395
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:44,871
I don't know, being entirely responsible
for another human being's life.

396
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:47,762
It's crazy.

397
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,182
- Aram, aram
- Mom's dead!

398
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,949
What? Come on.

399
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:57,627
She's not dead.

400
00:30:57,627 --> 00:30:59,829
Could be postmortem twitch.

401
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:02,599
Kids fall back.

402
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:10,657
Hey.

403
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:15,768
Sandy.

404
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:23,340
It's morning.

405
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:36,821
Oh my God, I slept with a babysitter.

406
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:41,542
You didn't sleep with a babysitter.

407
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,283
We thought you were dead.

408
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:47,738
Yeah, we thought you might have
asphyxiated on your own vomit

409
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,764
Aram can take us to school.
because we're already late.

410
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:58,610
- Could you?
- Sure

411
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,003
Can you pick them up too?

412
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:06,911
Are those stat sheets ready yet?

413
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:07,742
Yeah, printer 4.

414
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:15,953
Sandy, you got a minute?

415
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:24,612
Am I fired?

416
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:26,745
What! Why would you say that?

417
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:29,619
Because...

418
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,303
I'm so hangover, I guess.

419
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,296
I have two kids and no husband

420
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:40,136
I haven't had a real job since
graduate school. I'm so sorry

421
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:43,266
Oh, please don't apologize.

422
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:46,354
I was really calling you in to see
if you wanted to write for me.

423
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:53,004
I find the guys stuff gets boring and repetitive.

424
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:57,549
And I saw that stat book you put together, amazing.

425
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:59,973
Clearly obsessive, reminds me of me

426
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,403
Do you do yoga?

427
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:07,873
I will do yoga if I could win.

428
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:10,131
I'm gonna take you some time.

429
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:22,048
- Thanks.
- Hydrate.

430
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,245
Cool, what's your catch phrase gonna be?

431
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:29,165
I don't think it's gonna be like that, Frankie.

432
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:32,466
I'm just gonna be writing the basis of
the story and she will fill in the flavor.

433
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:36,159
- What about suck it?
- Why are you such an idiot?

434
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,537
It's just an idea.

435
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:41,181
That's really exciting though, I mean,
and you can even get some airtime.

436
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:44,219
I don't think so. -That will be cool, mom.

437
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:46,646
You have the face for it.

438
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:49,062
That's a nice thing to say.

439
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:52,433
"You have the face for it.",
Hmm, love you, love you, love you

440
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:57,099
I'm just saying that your mom has a face

441
00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:00,851
that would look good on TV.

442
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:07,390
I'm very together, I never
missed taking my kids to school.

443
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:12,919
You don't have to explain anything, I promise
I know what it's like to go through a divorce.

444
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:14,977
Are your parents divorced?

445
00:34:14,977 --> 00:34:16,987
No, I am, sort of.

446
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:20,123
You're so young.

447
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:21,884
When do you have the time?

448
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:24,036
It was short-lived, her name was Alice,

449
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:28,186
she left me for her brother.
He wasn't really her brother

450
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:31,713
he was just posing as her brother
so he could be close to her

451
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:33,658
So she could use me to get a green card.

452
00:34:33,658 --> 00:34:37,035
What!? That is horrible.

453
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,112
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

454
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:46,040
The worst part about it though is I can't
bring myself to finalize the divorce

455
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,773
because if I do
then she will get kicked out of the country

456
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:51,913
That would be so cruel, you know.

457
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,286
God, I wished I could get my husband
kicked out of the country.

458
00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:00,338
It's that bad, huh. -Yeah

459
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,908
- So sorry.
- Oh, no, me too, for you.

460
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:12,081
You know, Aram this has been really hard for me

461
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:15,199
and with a new job, there's gonna
be some longer hours.

462
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:18,420
And I was thinking, maybe you'd be willing

463
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,237
to help us out on more of a full time basis.

464
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:25,421
A nanny?

465
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:28,993
You're not from Trinidad, you're
from the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

466
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,684
Did we send you to college for this, Harry?

467
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,390
You always said
you just wanted me to be happy.

468
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,643
Within reason, this is not how you
contribute to the world.

469
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:39,077
Mom you work for Ralph Lauren.

470
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:40,123
People need clothes.

471
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:42,938
This family needs me, she just got divorced

472
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:45,736
and she got this great job

473
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:48,791
and she needs someone to
trust to take care of these kids..

474
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:52,724
Mom it's not like it's forever.

475
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,330
You know, I'm gonna be making money.

476
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:56,667
- Harry!
- Alright,

477
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,679
you're still going out on interviews for other jobs.

478
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,596
And in the meantime you can't
keep this for quite a while.

479
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:43,360
Let me try it, get a job, I'm a freaking racer.

480
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:48,832
It's not the same...It's not the same thing. because
you have to say the freaking first to make it work.

481
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:51,206
It's much funnier with the freaking, right?

482
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,768
I'm just gonna go outside and grab a smoke.

483
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:01,516
Smoke? What are they from stone age?

484
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:05,640
Please for some goddamn God, you got
to find something wrong with every guy

485
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,494
Did you see how long it takes
the guy to order a bow wine?

486
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,207
His father owns a vineyard
in Napa, so he knows a lot about it.

487
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,419
Like he mentioned several hundred times.

488
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:15,893
He mentioned it once.

489
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:18,915
Who is calling you?
You don't have a life.

490
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:21,699
It's Aram, he taught me how to text.

491
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,541
Oh my God!
What?

492
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,318
- You have a thing for the nanny
- Oh, please.

493
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:31,246
He's just telling me that my kids are asleep.

494
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:33,947
Kids asleep. Frank took...

495
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,231
Frank took two foot long poop, we measured.

496
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,938
It's disgusting.

497
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:42,005
Just keeping me in the loop and I appreciate that.

498
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:46,517
It's very funny, sincere.

499
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:50,795
and besides he's a lot more adult than
those guys you have set me up with.

500
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,197
In a 24-year old kind of way.

501
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:56,314
- Let me see what you wrote.
- No, no... you're not

502
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:03,634
About to bail on my date, set up monopoly?

503
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:07,665
This is pathetic. Seriously?

504
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:08,802
Yeah

505
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,499
Ok, here's the pussy.

506
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:23,584
I would love you to meet
Sunshine and Cinnamon.

507
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:26,362
Hi, I am Aram.

508
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:28,829
They love talking and stuff so...

509
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:33,032
Try to be normal, alright. Stay positive.

510
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:36,963
- Sorry.
- Aram, hey.

511
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:39,625
It's a weird name.

512
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,852
Thank you.

513
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:43,942
Mitch told me he is divorced.

514
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:46,297
It's weird, huh.

515
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:50,210
It's kinda normal to me,
you know, it's my life.

516
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,332
So I'm kinda used to it, I guess.

517
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,518
I guess if you mean, it's unusual, then yeah.

518
00:39:58,052 --> 00:40:00,333
We will talk a lot about this.

519
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,486
I guess.

520
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:07,859
I love theories.

521
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,428
Make me a little horny.

522
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,453
I think I'm gonna go.

523
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:28,629
Hey, it's me, what are you guys doing?

524
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,407
We're just playing "American Idol."

525
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:34,963
That was truly dreadful Aram
Finklestein, awful.

526
00:40:34,963 --> 00:40:38,925
You kinda like a little pitchy in the beginning
but dawg, I mean you put it together in the end,

527
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,963
and man you rocked.

528
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:44,733
Well Randy liked it, but I still don’t' think
I'm going to the next round.

529
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,980
I'm not gonna be able to make it home for dinner tonight.

530
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:49,338
Yeah, no problem.
I could feed the kids.

531
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:51,703
You may have to put them to bed too.

532
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:53,040
Can be a late one, huh

533
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,183
Yeah, a couple of
the Vikings player,

534
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,532
were charged of sexually assaulting a stripper

535
00:40:57,532 --> 00:41:00,097
I have to come up with something
fizzy for the board to leave this.

536
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:04,055
Well, Vikings have been attacking
people on ships for centuries now.

537
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,996
Aram, that's good but thank you.
I will see when I get home okay.

538
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:25,361
I'm sorry.

539
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:32,387
God, I can't imagine to be many more days like this.

540
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,645
No prob, there's dinner for you on the table there.

541
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:38,776
Oh thanks, you didn't have to do that.

542
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,210
Just whipped up on stuff that I learned on Top Chef

543
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:49,414
The kids helped,
and Frank's pretty good.

544
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:53,159
Delicious, wow, hmm... wait

545
00:41:53,675 --> 00:42:00,119
I have these two tickets for the fight on
Saturday, I thought you might be able to use them.

546
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:04,906
Aren't the kids with their dad this weekend?

547
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,253
- Yeah
- And you don't wanna use this?

548
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:12,622
My girlfriend's not free and I'm facing another date.

549
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:14,864
So take whoever you want.

550
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:19,756
- That's really nice, thanks.
- You're welcome.

551
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:27,143
Hey, I was wondering if you are free this weekend.

552
00:42:27,143 --> 00:42:28,789
because I have got these tickets to the big fight.

553
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:10,734
I hate it when the ref does that.

554
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:15,118
Why bother having a rest,
just let them bare-knuckle it.

555
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,496
I can't believe you were thinking of that coming.

556
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:21,383
Me neither.

557
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:24,699
I can never be like this with Frank

558
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:30,648
It was like I didn't even know if
I was happy when I was with him

559
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:34,175
What makes
people do that? Just coast along.

560
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,505
And you know the thing that really sticks for me

561
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:41,857
is that I never got the chance to
tell him how I felt.

562
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:44,855
He has this strange ability,

563
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,223
to make me entirely lose my voice.

564
00:43:49,814 --> 00:43:52,124
Like some superpower, it's crazy.

565
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:56,241
No Voice Man

566
00:43:56,241 --> 00:43:59,383
Steal You Voice Man, Quiet Man

567
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,457
Dr. Silence. That's a good one.

568
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:05,357
Hey, Aram, right?

569
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:07,821
Gile from Roscoe Mathis, I interviewed you.

570
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,184
Oh, yeah yeah. How are you?

571
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,828
Dude, you're the only person that's ever said
no to us most people would kill for that job.

572
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:17,483
Sorry about that.

573
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:20,909
Ringside at the fight,
doesn't look like you're doing too bad.

574
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,456
Let me know if you ever change your mind.

575
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:27,413
- Thanks.
- Good to see you again.

576
00:44:30,893 --> 00:44:32,551
What?

577
00:44:32,974 --> 00:44:35,299
It's just an entry level thing.

578
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:41,376
At Roscoe Mathis? And you
let that go to be my nanny?

579
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,600
Idiotic.

580
00:44:45,236 --> 00:44:46,790
I thought so too, for a minute.

581
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:51,502
I wasn't really thinking clearly there after Alice.

582
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:58,365
And suddenly I just had a very clear thought in my head.

583
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,323
What really matters are
the people in my life.

584
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:10,265
You and your family were, are some of those
people that make me feel good,

585
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:14,007
make my life good, every day.
Anyway, I guess.

586
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:23,096
That is the most wonderfully

587
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,931
and jaded naive thing I have ever heard..

588
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:31,828
It's rare to find
a guy who's such a romantic.

589
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,518
Bright light.

590
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:09,758
Just close those eyes.

591
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:13,141
- I'm not tired.
- You're really gonna sleep this off, buddy

592
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:18,074
I'm gonna put this here okay.

593
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:22,880
I really love your kids.

594
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,303
I know.

595
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:29,731
I had fun tonight.

596
00:46:32,395 --> 00:46:34,143
Yeah... me too.

597
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:40,652
None of you to call me that word, okay.

598
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:43,752
It's not a weird word, though
It's just means a "female dog"..

599
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:47,348
I'm not gonna have semantics today, okay.
- What are you doing here?

600
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:50,853
You know what it means, it's not okay to call
me that or anyone else for that matter

601
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:53,194
You have been in the city for a few months
they're already totally corrupted.

602
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,962
- Dad's play sucks.
- Frankie, what happened?

603
00:46:56,962 --> 00:46:59,649
- Aram!?
- Guys, careful...

604
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:02,610
Come on, you late night criminals

605
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,831
Hey, guess what?
You wanna give me a million dollars?

606
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:10,347
We saw a dead junk on the road.

607
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:11,686
Oh, even better.

608
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:14,316
We wanted to touch it but dad wouldn't let us.

609
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,601
You're running a home for delinquent boys.

610
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:20,244
Aram helps me with the kids, Frank.

611
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:22,907
The kids weren't here, so what's he doing here?

612
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,204
Can I just explain something to you?

613
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,242
You have no
rights in this house, okay.

614
00:47:28,704 --> 00:47:30,282
I don't like the way this separation is going.

615
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,052
Oh Really?

616
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:38,010
Well, I'm loving the way it's going,
this is exactly how I envisioned my life.

617
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,031
- Noticed how weird this thing was.
- That's mine.

618
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:44,639
What I wanna say, it's gonna come out wrong.

619
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,090
I want you back. I want our life back.

620
00:47:47,404 --> 00:47:49,030
Why are you doing this?

621
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:52,823
The truth is I couldn't handle the kids,
I just wanted to see you.

622
00:47:53,895 --> 00:47:56,788
You must missed me, at least a little.

623
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:00,793
I don't want you here.

624
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:03,969
Of course, I don't wanna be here.

625
00:48:04,872 --> 00:48:07,856
If you're good,
I will come back and do the grunge.

626
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:18,776
You can even work if you wanted to.

627
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:21,279
Part time.

628
00:48:22,306 --> 00:48:24,061
Imagine this..

629
00:48:27,626 --> 00:48:32,285
There are so many things
I wanted to say to you.

630
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:39,505
We're not gonna need you anymore.

631
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:42,421
Unless you wanna grab a bite to eat and
you can sit, are you on hourly?

632
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:45,943
I think Sandy had something that
she wanted to say to you.

633
00:48:48,314 --> 00:48:49,759
Didn't you?

634
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:04,615
I just wanted to tell you about some
feelings I have been having

635
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:09,437
you know

636
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:14,080
regarding you and your treatment of me.

637
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:20,159
What she wanted to say was...

638
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:25,404
and, this is pretty much,
word for word, if I remember properly

639
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:30,089
that you're a dirty little fucking scumbag

640
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:35,485
and I might be paraphrasing here, but you should

641
00:49:35,485 --> 00:49:40,956
take your disease riddled whore and
fuck her in hell for all eternity.

642
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,476
While the devil burns you...

643
00:49:43,443 --> 00:49:46,615
with hot jagged metal and suffocates you

644
00:49:47,764 --> 00:49:49,188
with molten fury.

645
00:49:54,264 --> 00:49:55,707
Fucking nutheads.

646
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:59,097
Don't come beg me to come back.

647
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:01,310
This was the last straw.

648
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,423
That was really good.

649
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:17,552
And by the way, I never loved you.

650
00:50:18,169 --> 00:50:20,773
And I'm changing our son's name to Pablo

651
00:50:21,278 --> 00:50:23,550
so I'm never have to be reminded of you.

652
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,591
And suck at your little bitch.

653
00:50:31,726 --> 00:50:33,879
You are off tomorrow, come take me out.

654
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:38,395
Dude, back in the saddle!

655
00:50:38,395 --> 00:50:40,724
Who's the unsuspecting lovely lady?

656
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,765
- Her name?
- Yes

657
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:47,803
The thing that you will be calling out in bed.

658
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:49,786
if she's all upon you...

659
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:55,554
Sandy

660
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,823
It's your boss' name, isn't it?

661
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:02,689
Wait a minute, are you
gonna date your boss?

662
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,733
Oh that's hot.

663
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:08,737
Oh, wait no, she's like 60 though, I thought.

664
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,275
She's 40.

665
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:12,540
But she got like a hundred kids though.

666
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,260
Two

667
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:18,715
So, when's this all going down?

668
00:51:19,582 --> 00:51:21,673
Actually, tonight.

669
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:24,976
Dude...

670
00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:28,122
tonight's my showcase.

671
00:51:28,537 --> 00:51:30,568
I sent you a postcard.

672
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,541
Right. It's just that she already hired another babysitter.

673
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:45,262
Work's been really busy so finding another
time would be virtually impossible.

674
00:51:45,262 --> 00:51:46,982
You will understand.

675
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:54,242
Welcome one and all to the second annual
Holligan theater, group showcase workshop

676
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:59,443
I am your host, actor, director,
choreographer, Magnus Croom

677
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:01,580
Thank you.

678
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:07,685
You are about to see 46

679
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:14,670
of the most daring the most
empathetic beings in this out fair city.

680
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:21,208
offering to you, performances from their
favorite works of stage and screen.

681
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,224
Please keep your seats throughout.

682
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:28,301
for there will be no intermission.
Thank you and let the magic begin.

683
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:29,391
Stella!

684
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,855
Stella!

685
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:44,435
To be..

686
00:52:46,516 --> 00:52:47,882
or not be.

687
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:50,649
That is the question

688
00:52:51,423 --> 00:52:53,282
Whether it is nobler

689
00:52:53,282 --> 00:52:59,239
in the mind to suffer The slings
and arrows of outrageous fortune

690
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,371
There he is.

691
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:21,477
I had him in view.

692
00:53:21,477 --> 00:53:23,753
I was feeling over the edge into a dive.

693
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:28,992
He saw me when I moved in for the kill.

694
00:53:28,992 --> 00:53:33,538
Is that how you remember it, Maverick?

695
00:53:33,538 --> 00:53:37,657
- Is this Top Gun?
- I'm pretty sure.

696
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:40,923
The rules of engagement
are not flexible, Maverick.

697
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:48,431
They are there for your safety
you will obey them, is that clear?

698
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:50,281
Maverick!

699
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:52,158
Yes, sir, perfectly clear.

700
00:53:52,158 --> 00:53:53,670
I guess we...

701
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,649
I...

702
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:57,951
was just a little over enthusiastic.

703
00:53:57,951 --> 00:54:00,425
I guess you were...

704
00:54:04,694 --> 00:54:05,994
Dismissed (Sounds like Platoon)!

705
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:10,303
Dismissed!

706
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:21,330
Hey, oh bro, I'm so glad you made it.

707
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,320
I made it... I'm here.

708
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:30,049
.. saw the whole thing.

709
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:32,492
Even your part.

710
00:54:34,757 --> 00:54:37,468
Was that Top Gun? -You know it was.

711
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:45,122
We thought you were really great.

712
00:54:45,122 --> 00:54:48,119
I loved your postmodern take on the whole thing

713
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:53,501
and it was creative how you
acknowledged how derivative it was.

714
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:57,997
Thank you.

715
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:01,399
Thank you so much.

716
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:05,396
I told you guys...

717
00:55:05,943 --> 00:55:08,204
I told you people would get it.

718
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:11,486
You gotta go party with us.

719
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:28,062
I guess in a tree house.

720
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,028
Outdoor shower.

721
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,468
Refrigerator -In a refrigerator?

722
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,233
All over it.

723
00:55:43,942 --> 00:55:46,597
In the display case of the coffee shop where I work.

724
00:55:51,332 --> 00:55:52,841
Don't do that..

725
00:56:01,742 --> 00:56:03,505
The craziest place

726
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:06,063
I have to say...

727
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,310
on the surfboard, in the ocean.

728
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:16,097
Sesha buche.

729
00:56:22,985 --> 00:56:24,659
It's really romantic.

730
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,486
Hello, Aram.

731
00:57:09,402 --> 00:57:12,460
I have been thinking a lot about you lately.

732
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:15,634
Hi, Alice.

733
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:21,555
I have regrets about, you know, how I broke up with you

734
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:25,822
I found I have this problem with sex

735
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:32,775
because I just use it to get what I want and
I really think that's what I did with you.

736
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,066
I would love to meet with you,

737
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:45,003
so we can talk and make some apologies to you.

738
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:49,097
- Amends?
- Yes, amends.

739
00:57:51,113 --> 00:57:52,430
I'm really sorry.

740
00:57:53,573 --> 00:57:58,605
You know, I should get going.
I don't wanna keep my sister waiting.

741
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:00,211
What?

742
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:12,619
- I'm so hot.
- Tell me about it.

743
00:58:39,354 --> 00:58:41,774
So? It was...

744
00:58:41,774 --> 00:58:43,273
Long.

745
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:46,617
I know, I think that you went to a hotel or something.

746
00:58:46,617 --> 00:58:47,822
Oh please.

747
00:58:50,949 --> 00:58:53,960
Honey, what's with your hair?

748
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,443
What?

749
00:58:58,846 --> 00:59:00,280
Okay, fine.

750
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:04,870
It was awkward and cute and tedious.

751
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:07,698
Did you just say cute and tedious?

752
00:59:07,698 --> 00:59:10,929
I mean he's a kid and it was tedious.

753
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,119
Sounds like you didn't give him a chance.

754
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:17,957
- Did you even kiss those young, supple lips?
- We didn't get there.

755
00:59:18,207 --> 00:59:22,771
We went to his friend's acting showcase
and to this after party at The Loft

756
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:24,211
Acting showcase?

757
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:26,399
But now I need a bath.

758
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:28,513
Alright. My God

759
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:32,513
What?

760
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:36,408
Thanks for babysitting.

761
00:59:36,408 --> 00:59:37,948
Okay.

762
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:41,539
- Sorry you couldn't get laid.
- Shut up.

763
00:59:53,771 --> 00:59:55,884
Tedious. -Just to get rid of her.

764
00:59:59,123 --> 01:00:00,969
It was or it wasn't it?

765
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:06,403
- Oh wait a minute, not quite so much tongue.
- That's specific.

766
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:18,421
Oh, God.

767
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:25,376
That's gross.

768
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:27,299
- Oh shit.
- Oh, God.

769
01:00:31,388 --> 01:00:34,856
Frank? What are you doing up?

770
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:36,835
Was Aram peeing on you?

771
01:00:36,835 --> 01:00:37,585
No!

772
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:41,291
I would never do that.

773
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:44,559
Okay, are you sleeping over?

774
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:46,787
- No.
- No.

775
01:00:47,252 --> 01:00:48,594
- No?
- Oh, well.

776
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:52,356
Don't forget your pants.

777
01:00:55,673 --> 01:00:58,991
So does that mean you and mom are
gonna have a baby? No!

778
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:02,009
I don't get it you said that sperm makes a baby.

779
01:01:02,009 --> 01:01:03,415
Sperm. and it does.

780
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:09,509
Can we stop talking
about this, please?

781
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:14,006
I like your mother and I
think she likes me,

782
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:16,203
and it's all that's important.

783
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,221
You also work for her.

784
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:20,968
- Whose turn is it?
- Mine.

785
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:24,570
Okay.

786
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:28,968
Come on, Frankie, let's get off the doughnut.

787
01:01:32,604 --> 01:01:34,642
How is that possible?

788
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:36,681
So, you like mom.

789
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:40,083
- Are you two gonna date now?
- I don't know.

790
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,375
You don't really know anything, do you?

791
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,662
- I mean, she's kind of your girlfriend.
- Are you gonna be our new dad?

792
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,691
- and if so, who will be our nanny?
- Yeah, and what do we call you?

793
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:55,836
Jesus, I'm not being nominated to supreme court
here guys, I just had sex with your mother.

794
01:01:57,566 --> 01:02:01,082
When I say sex,
I mean that I gave her

795
01:02:01,423 --> 01:02:02,881
a nice massage.

796
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:04,340
With sperm.

797
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:09,882
Oh, you conniving little liar. Oh is he
hiding in the hall?

798
01:02:10,132 --> 01:02:12,698
My God, he was.

799
01:02:12,698 --> 01:02:14,885
- It's all so dirty.
- Dirty?

800
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:17,313
Ok, it's a little dirty

801
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:24,899
Well you got that out of your system.
Now you're free to meet your next real guy.

802
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:26,944
What does that mean?

803
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:31,023
What, it means now when you meet a viable man
he won't have to be your rebound.

804
01:02:31,273 --> 01:02:33,084
because your nanny was your rebound.

805
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:35,729
Gives you pleasure to say that, doesn't it?

806
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:39,245
I'm not sure of buying
that "The Rebound" thing.

807
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:40,899
Oh what, you're gonna date the nanny?

808
01:02:40,899 --> 01:02:44,361
Was having one night stand with
a nanny more dignified?

809
01:02:44,816 --> 01:02:46,836
No, just more practical

810
01:02:49,006 --> 01:02:50,406
Wait a minute.

811
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:52,667
You actually have feelings for this kid?

812
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:54,579
Feelings? I have feelings
for everyone.

813
01:02:54,579 --> 01:02:55,951
That's the way the world works.

814
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:58,993
God, you're in serious justification mode.

815
01:02:59,853 --> 01:03:01,981
Why do you have to be so cynical?

816
01:03:02,751 --> 01:03:07,508
I mean, I don't judge your
blatant disregard's recycling.

817
01:03:11,122 --> 01:03:13,989
This is not about judgment.
This is about my friend.

818
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:16,857
and what is realistic and
what is not realistic for her.

819
01:03:17,123 --> 01:03:20,090
It's about me not wanting to see you get hurt.

820
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,683
Happy birthday... -Thank you.

821
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,476
Are you one? Are you two? Are you three ...

822
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:30,069
We get it.

823
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:35,646
You need anything?

824
01:03:39,427 --> 01:03:40,733
Stop it.

825
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,222
Okay.

826
01:03:45,831 --> 01:03:48,113
So did Aram tell you about
this operation I'm having?

827
01:03:48,113 --> 01:03:50,380
- Harry?
- No.

828
01:03:51,178 --> 01:03:53,438
They're gonna give me a new asshole.

829
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:54,715
There are children here.

830
01:03:54,715 --> 01:03:56,867
- Cool, like from a dead guy?
- Sadie.

831
01:03:56,867 --> 01:04:00,500
I think they're gonna just fashion
one out of something.

832
01:04:00,769 --> 01:04:03,573
Hopefully, something elastic.

833
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:05,724
Awesome.

834
01:04:06,206 --> 01:04:07,800
Excuse me.

835
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:15,231
This is so... weird.

836
01:04:19,658 --> 01:04:21,527
My dad telling you about his surgery?

837
01:04:21,527 --> 01:04:24,418
Yeah.. I didn't know they can even do that.

838
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,660
You look really pretty..

839
01:04:30,656 --> 01:04:32,950
No, no...

840
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,978
- We are in your parent's house
- I know.

841
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,021
Where is everybody?

842
01:04:43,851 --> 01:04:45,865
Just a little red, I don't think it's trapped.

843
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:51,667
Cake time.

844
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,871
This one is just from me.

845
01:04:58,847 --> 01:05:02,049
Gummy bears and hand lotion.

846
01:05:03,573 --> 01:05:05,322
Thanks, Dad.

847
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,305
Please. Open your mother's.

848
01:05:13,555 --> 01:05:15,984
- No, no, he will open yours.
- You're his mother.

849
01:05:15,984 --> 01:05:18,545
Well, you're his employer. I insist.

850
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:20,692
You will love it.

851
01:05:23,311 --> 01:05:24,784
It's not fake poop, is it?

852
01:05:24,784 --> 01:05:27,164
- No.
- That's for Christmas.

853
01:05:27,164 --> 01:05:28,798
Oh, you have Christmas.

854
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,045
What do we got here?

855
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:41,841
The human totem pole.

856
01:05:44,545 --> 01:05:46,398
Gotta get you up here next time

857
01:05:46,398 --> 01:05:47,623
I don't think so.

858
01:05:48,093 --> 01:05:50,088
This is great, thank you so much.

859
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:52,369
- Good.
- This is perfect.

860
01:05:57,867 --> 01:05:58,730
Thanks Mom.

861
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,204
- That one's just from me.
- So nice.

862
01:06:02,533 --> 01:06:03,795
Where did you get these butterflies?

863
01:06:03,795 --> 01:06:08,703
My grandmother gave that to my father and
I think it's time for you to have that.

864
01:06:20,765 --> 01:06:23,589
The message applies all these years later.

865
01:06:24,858 --> 01:06:28,103
A mother's love can never be replaced.

866
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:30,976
- Never.
- Never.

867
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,490
Thanks, Mom.

868
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,363
It's antique.

869
01:06:38,363 --> 01:06:41,018
- Whoa, that's cool
- Beautiful.

870
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:45,146
- I might throw up.
- What's the chances?

871
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:47,248
60-40

872
01:06:51,204 --> 01:06:52,848
Which direction?

873
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:56,279
70-30. now.

874
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:03,878
At least you're, we're in your percentages.

875
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,312
Sing me a song.

876
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,813
No, you have to go to bed.

877
01:07:10,813 --> 01:07:13,676
Sing me a song, or I will blow up on you.

878
01:07:14,225 --> 01:07:16,213
When you put it that way.

879
01:07:16,776 --> 01:07:21,251
Let' me see. Let me reach into my repertoire here.

880
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:22,454
Blow up.

881
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,740
Stay tonight.

882
01:08:42,235 --> 01:08:42,300
Two Months Later

883
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:46,579
Are we sure this guy is real?
I mean, has anybody met him?

884
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:48,823
He has no time to meet us,
he has high school and all that homework...

885
01:08:50,405 --> 01:08:52,092
Isn't he on a baseball team?

886
01:08:52,566 --> 01:08:53,898
He's just running a little late.

887
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,649
Well, he's definitely responsible for
an attitude change, because you

888
01:08:58,659 --> 01:08:59,936
well, you can't just stop smiling.

889
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:03,448
- She's glowing.
- Well, he's doing something right.

890
01:09:04,993 --> 01:09:07,042
I am sorry I'm late.

891
01:09:07,955 --> 01:09:11,328
Babysitter needs to be walked through everything.

892
01:09:13,478 --> 01:09:13,935
Hi.

893
01:09:13,935 --> 01:09:15,332
I'm Aram.

894
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:17,209
I'm sorry, this is Aram.

895
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:20,282
Would you like a coke or something?

896
01:09:20,282 --> 01:09:22,744
- Scott.
- I will take some wine..

897
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:30,170
So Aram, I have heard a lot about you.

898
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:32,049
I hope all good things.

899
01:09:32,049 --> 01:09:36,090
That you're wonderful with children,
that you're a great cook...

900
01:09:36,538 --> 01:09:39,338
that you were born in 1983.

901
01:09:39,818 --> 01:09:42,596
Jesus! I was pregnant
in 1983.

902
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:47,621
Let's just go on and get it out on the table, get
it out in the open so we can enjoy our dinner.

903
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:49,937
Yes, I was born in the early 80s.

904
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:53,531
She also told me that you were very handsome
and that seems to be true.

905
01:09:53,828 --> 01:09:55,853
I think that it's great you guys are together.

906
01:09:56,174 --> 01:09:57,607
In the words of The Bart:

907
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:00,356
"The heart wants what it wants. "

908
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:02,102
You are so gay.

909
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:05,837
Sir, are you ready?

910
01:10:05,837 --> 01:10:07,474
I can be.

911
01:10:08,236 --> 01:10:13,339
Scott, right? Do you mind if I
borrow your glasses?

912
01:10:15,789 --> 01:10:19,811
You know, I'm just kidding, I'm only 25,
I don't need reading glasses.

913
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:32,918
Don't you wanna

914
01:10:32,918 --> 01:10:35,483
travel around the world, you know

915
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:39,223
get crazy, rock Cleveland

916
01:10:39,223 --> 01:10:43,154
do things that people
your age supposed to do?

917
01:10:44,197 --> 01:10:45,679
Rock Cleveland?

918
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,514
Yeah, rock it.

919
01:10:53,432 --> 01:10:54,807
You know what I mean
Live.

920
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:59,826
To tell you the truth this is
the most alive I have ever felt.

921
01:10:59,826 --> 01:11:01,690
You have to be so goddamn romantic.

922
01:11:05,712 --> 01:11:08,635
What about kids? Kids of your own..

923
01:11:08,635 --> 01:11:09,632
It's not like you're 50.

924
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,730
But I'm an old 40.

925
01:11:12,029 --> 01:11:13,687
What the hell does that mean?

926
01:11:14,414 --> 01:11:16,080
I'm wrinkly.

927
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,264
You have no wrinkles on your face, do you?

928
01:11:20,269 --> 01:11:23,562
You seem to have eyes, something
that I really love about you.

929
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:25,995
I love you.

930
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:32,632
and when you compliment me I love it,
when you compliment me.

931
01:11:32,632 --> 01:11:34,192
You know, I heard you the first time.

932
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:38,213
I have no idea what you were referring to.

933
01:11:38,213 --> 01:11:42,083
- No? You said I love you.
- I didn't say that.

934
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:44,800
I'm pretty sure you did.

935
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,028
And I love you too.

936
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,219
Really?

937
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,810
Sorry, but I do.

938
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,104
Let's just...
take it slowly.

939
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,306
Slowly.

940
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:22,523
Teram Owens, the man who wore baggage than
a first class passenger on the Titanic

941
01:12:22,523 --> 01:12:23,875
Reaching but funny.

942
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:26,541
T.O. the pig fan of the National Football League

943
01:12:27,234 --> 01:12:31,586
wherever he goes he is surrounded
by distinct controversy.

944
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:33,672
I like it.

945
01:12:33,672 --> 01:12:36,133
All that sex really agrees with your creative side.

946
01:12:37,003 --> 01:12:39,594
Are you alright, sweetie? You look pale.

947
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:42,137
No, I'm just dizzy from following you around.

948
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:45,613
Well, get that to me, please

949
01:12:45,613 --> 01:12:46,874
Right away.

950
01:12:58,272 --> 01:12:59,631
Alright.

951
01:13:01,612 --> 01:13:03,386
It helps me think.

952
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:21,501
We should talk.

953
01:13:23,759 --> 01:13:25,519
I knew this was coming.

954
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:31,337
You think the books that I read are too juvenile.

955
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:33,963
I know, it's just I have always liked this stuff..

956
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:35,637
I'm pregnant.

957
01:13:40,361 --> 01:13:41,998
But...

958
01:13:41,998 --> 01:13:44,457
I pull out most of the time.

959
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:49,987
I know you're not ready for this,
just that I know that

960
01:13:50,237 --> 01:13:52,358
I'd feel the same way if I were you...

961
01:13:54,634 --> 01:13:58,689
I just thought that we,
that you wanted to take things slowly.

962
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:01,885
I did.

963
01:14:05,296 --> 01:14:06,627
This is...

964
01:14:08,188 --> 01:14:09,548
big.

965
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,801
This is...
Very... big.

966
01:14:13,801 --> 01:14:15,843
I should have been more careful.

967
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:21,107
I know this sounds crazy

968
01:14:23,908 --> 01:14:26,406
but I think I wanted this to happen.

969
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,933
What?

970
01:14:32,547 --> 01:14:34,589
You said it yourself you don't wanna just coast

971
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,947
you know just coast along but this isn't coasting.

972
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:42,025
This is roller coasting.

973
01:14:43,152 --> 01:14:44,579
Oh, my God.

974
01:14:46,351 --> 01:14:49,427
Not Oh God... this is a good thing,

975
01:14:49,427 --> 01:14:53,336
not the roller coasting thing, that was cheesy but...

976
01:14:53,972 --> 01:14:56,747
having a baby with you that's not cheesy.

977
01:14:56,747 --> 01:14:59,523
I mean... that's not what I'm saying just...

978
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:02,813
excited, I wanna be your father.

979
01:15:02,813 --> 01:15:03,763
What?

980
01:15:03,763 --> 01:15:09,316
No, I wanna be a father with you as the mother,
that's the important part.

981
01:15:09,316 --> 01:15:10,766
You being a mother.

982
01:15:11,266 --> 01:15:13,264
You know, I thought, I hope that kid is like you

983
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:18,071
I hope the kid's like you.

984
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:20,504
A girl with brown eyes...

985
01:15:21,915 --> 01:15:24,297
or a boy with brown eyes...

986
01:15:24,297 --> 01:15:27,127
or just any color eyes

987
01:15:27,127 --> 01:15:29,668
Well, it's not the baby's head, not just eyes.

988
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,041
What about Gium?

989
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,879
For a boy, obviously

990
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:46,860
Gium Finklestein?

991
01:15:49,814 --> 01:15:51,398
Point taken.

992
01:15:56,758 --> 01:15:58,209
What about Ira?

993
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,511
Ok
The doctor will see you now.

994
01:16:02,795 --> 01:16:04,216
Great.

995
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,494
Okay so...

996
01:16:11,754 --> 01:16:12,504
So?

997
01:16:13,299 --> 01:16:14,898
The blood work is normal.

998
01:16:15,624 --> 01:16:17,723
In other words, you are healthy.

999
01:16:18,322 --> 01:16:21,931
And that is always a good sign for future pregnancies.

1000
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,032
What do you mean future?

1001
01:16:25,822 --> 01:16:30,279
I mean, this here is what we call an ectopic pregnancy.

1002
01:16:32,562 --> 01:16:36,397
There are any number explanations for this,
it's not necessarily because of your age.

1003
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:37,272
God.

1004
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:39,738
This is something that happens
periodically.

1005
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:44,099
An embryo was formed but it takes
root inside the fallopian tube

1006
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:49,506
instead of the uterus. This doesn't mean you
can't have children again in the future...

1007
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:05,272
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy...

1008
01:17:07,098 --> 01:17:08,729
This was crazy.

1009
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,657
I mean, what were we thinking, anyway?

1010
01:17:14,242 --> 01:17:15,710
You are so young.

1011
01:17:15,991 --> 01:17:17,390
God!

1012
01:17:17,615 --> 01:17:20,692
You live at your parent's house and
technically you work for me

1013
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:22,942
and I was thinking about having your baby?

1014
01:17:22,942 --> 01:17:24,395
What is going on?

1015
01:17:25,412 --> 01:17:26,985
So you have to know?

1016
01:17:26,985 --> 01:17:28,425
Can't we just find out?

1017
01:17:28,425 --> 01:17:30,973
That is a deceivingly mature thing to say.

1018
01:17:32,057 --> 01:17:33,510
Why is it deceiving?

1019
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,671
Because you're 25 years old...

1020
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,722
you get drunk off half a beer

1021
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:41,458
and you read the Harry Potter
series in your spare time.

1022
01:17:41,764 --> 01:17:43,418
A lot of adult read those books.

1023
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:48,289
And besides the way I remembered it,
you're the one that asked me out

1024
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,552
I appreciate that you feel this could work

1025
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,794
more than you will ever know.

1026
01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:58,983
You are such a good person

1027
01:17:59,235 --> 01:18:01,192
a real special person,

1028
01:18:01,192 --> 01:18:06,058
I mean not filing for divorce so your
horrible ex-wife can get a green card

1029
01:18:07,102 --> 01:18:08,381
What would be the point?

1030
01:18:08,381 --> 01:18:11,955
See, that's what I mean, someone like you
shouldn't be with someone like me.

1031
01:18:12,746 --> 01:18:14,384
An old girlfriend with two kids.

1032
01:18:15,126 --> 01:18:16,797
You're an ageist...

1033
01:18:17,047 --> 01:18:19,690
Yeah, yeah... I'm an old ageist.

1034
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:22,338
Oh please, don't patronize me.

1035
01:18:22,973 --> 01:18:26,696
I may live with my parents and
get drunk off half a beer

1036
01:18:26,946 --> 01:18:31,604
and yeah, I admit to being
slightly adrift as far in my life

1037
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,305
but I'm not a complete idiot...

1038
01:18:33,555 --> 01:18:35,612
I know how I feel about you.

1039
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,259
It's you that doesn't know
how you feel about me.

1040
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,069
I just wish you had the guts to say it.

1041
01:18:46,261 --> 01:18:48,437
You have meant so much to me and my family

1042
01:18:50,337 --> 01:18:52,404
but this doesn't make sense.

1043
01:18:53,089 --> 01:18:55,229
And what future can we possibly have?

1044
01:19:03,033 --> 01:19:04,798
You know what I'm gonna miss the most?

1045
01:19:08,335 --> 01:19:09,998
It's you...

1046
01:19:11,374 --> 01:19:13,157
Your friendship.

1047
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:05,410
Go!

1048
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:09,302
Graduating Class of 2012.

1049
01:22:09,302 --> 01:22:14,903
Sadie Pageant and Sadie also received
the award for best science project

1050
01:23:58,854 --> 01:24:02,906
We need to say a special thanks to you
for bringing us into your homes,

1051
01:24:02,906 --> 01:24:06,173
but most of all to those unsung fanatics.

1052
01:24:06,173 --> 01:24:08,622
- Who make us look good.
- Yeah, we do look good.

1053
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:11,284
- I'm Laura Riley.
- And I'm Scott Reynolds,

1054
01:24:11,284 --> 01:24:13,109
TMI coming at you next.

1055
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:19,649
Sandy, you got a minute?

1056
01:24:24,365 --> 01:24:26,678
Hello.. hello.

1057
01:24:27,636 --> 01:24:28,769
Hello people.

1058
01:24:28,769 --> 01:24:32,181
Our illustrious leader, Ken Gordon,
has an announcement to make.

1059
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:38,592
Although change can be
painful, change can also be a good thing

1060
01:24:38,592 --> 01:24:43,774
a necessary step in the evolution of
a company, a family like ours...

1061
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:47,429
From the beginning of time
all the way till today

1062
01:24:48,241 --> 01:24:51,155
there are certain things that
you will always find.

1063
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:57,697
Now, if you look at the pictures, can anyone see
what they all have in common?

1064
01:24:59,108 --> 01:25:01,769
- Liv
- There are people in all of them.

1065
01:25:01,769 --> 01:25:03,230
Exactly, great answer.

1066
01:25:03,434 --> 01:25:08,015
so almost everywhere you go in the world you're
gonna find these little communities of people

1067
01:25:08,015 --> 01:25:10,331
just like you guys
you guys are a community...

1068
01:25:10,331 --> 01:25:11,868
your class, your family...

1069
01:25:11,868 --> 01:25:13,920
I just came back from Mozambique.

1070
01:25:14,144 --> 01:25:17,216
- Okay.
- I have been to the Nantucket Film Festival.

1071
01:25:22,382 --> 01:25:24,112
Aram?

1072
01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:31,817
You're the only one who gets
gifts from the kids at the end of every tour.

1073
01:25:31,817 --> 01:25:35,111
That's probably because
they're so excited, the tour is over.

1074
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:36,477
Good to see you.

1075
01:25:36,726 --> 01:25:40,324
I was gonna go get a drink,
You wanna join me?

1076
01:25:41,779 --> 01:25:43,897
You know what I actually...

1077
01:25:44,551 --> 01:25:46,138
Have plans already...

1078
01:25:46,138 --> 01:25:48,008
I do.

1079
01:25:50,572 --> 01:25:52,344
You're impossible.

1080
01:25:52,805 --> 01:25:54,506
I have heard that before.

1081
01:25:56,629 --> 01:25:58,593
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, have a good night.

1082
01:25:59,823 --> 01:26:07,399
Here's to your mother... the newest and undoubtedly
most qualified anchor of the network, very deserved.

1083
01:26:07,649 --> 01:26:08,761
Thank you.

1084
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:10,957
- Congratulations Mom.
- Thanks.

1085
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:15,729
I know your own show is big step up
but I'm gonna miss you.

1086
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:21,268
I will be one studio over,
and I will come in guesting.

1087
01:26:21,268 --> 01:26:23,287
I'm gonna hold you to that.

1088
01:26:25,464 --> 01:26:27,470
Gotta use the ladies' room

1089
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:29,476
then we could stuff our faces.

1090
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:37,261
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1091
01:26:41,748 --> 01:26:42,248
Hi

1092
01:26:43,506 --> 01:26:44,006
Hi

1093
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:55,377
- How are you?
- How are you?

1094
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,061
You first.

1095
01:26:58,312 --> 01:27:00,722
I'm good, yeah good

1096
01:27:02,162 --> 01:27:04,233
Kids are great...

1097
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:06,520
I just got promoted

1098
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,234
I'm gonna start anchoring.

1099
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:12,428
I watch you on TV, you're fantastic.

1100
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:15,002
But that's not any surprise.

1101
01:27:16,973 --> 01:27:19,087
You look really good.

1102
01:27:21,345 --> 01:27:23,086
I'm 30.

1103
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:31,699
I'm sorry about.. you know.. things

1104
01:27:32,787 --> 01:27:34,855
Don't even...

1105
01:27:34,855 --> 01:27:37,420
It's just timing.

1106
01:27:40,585 --> 01:27:41,861
Traveled around the world.

1107
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:44,494
- Oh you did?
- Never rocked Cleveland.

1108
01:27:44,494 --> 01:27:47,197
but some pretty amazing things happened to me.

1109
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:51,091
Dad, I told you I could do it myself.

1110
01:27:51,091 --> 01:27:55,157
I knew you could do it yourself.
I bumped into a friend of mine.

1111
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:58,134
Sandy... I want
you to meet my son, Zeke.

1112
01:27:59,737 --> 01:28:03,389
I met him in Bangladesh
and we kinda fell in love with each other.

1113
01:28:05,176 --> 01:28:08,269
It took a couple of years,
but now I'm his dad.

1114
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:09,730
Hi

1115
01:28:10,224 --> 01:28:12,444
Hi, I'm Zeke Finklestein.

1116
01:28:12,444 --> 01:28:14,161
You are huh?

1117
01:28:14,161 --> 01:28:15,553
I'm Sandy.

1118
01:28:15,553 --> 01:28:17,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1119
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:25,509
God, I bet you're an amazing dad.

1120
01:28:27,603 --> 01:28:28,269
And his mom?

1121
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:32,543
Just me and Zeke, it's hard to find someone
that's good enough for us.

1122
01:28:35,747 --> 01:28:37,390
Right?

1123
01:28:38,943 --> 01:28:41,283
And what about you? Boyfriend?

1124
01:28:43,212 --> 01:28:47,336
Dating... wasn't
my thing... I discovered.

1125
01:28:47,336 --> 01:28:49,496
That's too bad.

1126
01:28:50,135 --> 01:28:52,743
Would you like to join us?

1127
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,374
You know, the kids would be thrilled, they...

1128
01:28:55,374 --> 01:28:57,124
- I'm with my parents...
- They talk about you all the time

1129
01:28:57,124 --> 01:29:00,909
Oh, you had me so worried, did you fall in?
I thought you fall in

1130
01:29:02,414 --> 01:29:04,487
Mom, you remember Sandy?

1131
01:29:04,487 --> 01:29:07,634
How could I forget?
You talk about her every day.

1132
01:29:10,246 --> 01:29:13,388
I was just saying to Aram, you know,
if he wants to join us

1133
01:29:13,388 --> 01:29:16,530
Oh are you kidding? We would love to,
we would love to! Come with me

1134
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,071
Harry, get up, we're moving.

1135
01:29:19,071 --> 01:29:20,218
I didn't do anything.

1136
01:29:20,218 --> 01:29:23,298
I didn't say you did anything
I said we're moving tables..

1137
01:29:31,268 --> 01:29:34,466
- Hey guys, look who I just bumped into.
- Oh my God!

1138
01:29:34,466 --> 01:29:37,369
Look at how huge are,
you, you look like you're 13..

1139
01:29:38,417 --> 01:29:40,517
- I am.
- What?

1140
01:29:40,823 --> 01:29:44,199
I want you guys to meet someone,
this is my son Zeke.

1141
01:29:44,938 --> 01:29:48,482
- You wanna play Game Boy?
- Yeah, go ahead... take a seat.

1142
01:29:48,981 --> 01:29:51,603
Nice to see you. It's been years. -Yeah

1143
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:58,124
We all get older and
you stay the same.

1144
01:29:58,124 --> 01:29:59,225
- Hello.
- Hi

1145
01:29:59,225 --> 01:30:01,360
What a surprise.

1146
01:30:01,587 --> 01:30:02,578
You remember us, do you?

1147
01:30:03,413 --> 01:30:06,824
- You came to our house, remember?
- They're a group. They're already a group.
