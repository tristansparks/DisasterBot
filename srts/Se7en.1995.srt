00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,354
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider that
the books were the killer's inspiration.

524
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,982
The sermons
were about atonement for sin.

525
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,276
These murders are
like forced attrition.

526
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,029
- Forced what?
- Attrition.

527
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,990
It's when you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.

528
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,202
Oh, like because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.

529
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,829
Mm-hm.

530
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,583
- No fingerprints.
- Nope.

531
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,003
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yup.

532
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,631
And no witnesses of any kind.

533
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,466
Which I don't get.

534
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,886
Because the fucker
had to get back out.

535
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:34,975
Well, in any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

536
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:39,020
The first thing they teach women in
rape prevention is never cry for help.

537
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,356
Always yell "Fire."

538
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,816
Nobody answers to "Help."

539
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,901
You holler "fire,"
they come running.

540
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,736
That's fucked up.

541
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,198
He must've left another
puzzle piece.

542
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,909
You know what?

543
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,371
Thank you for talking this
out, but I gotta sleep.

544
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:00,167
- Walk the dogs.
- This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.

545
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,044
- I'm still leaving at the end of the week.
- Oh, shit.

546
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,838
No, wait, wait.

547
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,842
Gould's wife. She was
out of town at the time.

548
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,220
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

549
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,056
Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

550
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,017

551
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,227
(DOGS BARKING)

552
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,860
SOMERSET: What if it isn't
something she has seen?

553
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:31,114
But something she's supposed to see,
but hasn't been given a chance?

554
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,991
Yeah, okay. What?

555
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,118
I don't know.

556
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,997
But that's the one thing.

557
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,669
MILLS:
Sign us in.

558
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,921
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

559
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,423
GOULD:
treat me like a prisoner.

560
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,760
Why do you have a phone if I can't
make long distance phone calls?

561
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,011
Mrs. Gould?

562
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,596
GOULD:
Don't treat people like this.

563
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,641
(GOULD CRYING)

564
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,104
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry.
I truly am.

565
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,606
I don't understand.

566
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,861
Okay, I need you to look at
each photo very carefully.

567
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:56,992
Look and see if there's anything
strange or out of place.

568
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,159
Um, anything at all.

569
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,246
I don't see anything.
You're sure?

570
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,915
Please, I just...
I can't do this right now.

571
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,709
Okay.

572
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,752
SOMERSET: (WHISPERS)
It's got to be now.

573
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,213
There may be something
we haven't seen.

574
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,473
GOULD:
Wait.

575
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,892
- What?
- Here.

576
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,858
This painting, it's upside down.

577
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,242
- You sure your men didn't move this?
- No, no.

578
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:42,120
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

579
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,666
Nothing.

580
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:50,211
There's gotta be something.

581
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,391
- Moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

582
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,439
What the fuck is that?

583
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,275
Switchblade.

584
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,118
Goddamn it.

585
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,083
There must be something.

586
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,382
He didn't paint the
fucking thing.

587
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,059
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

588
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,145
See this? This is us.

589
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,814
Yeah.

590
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,607
Just wait a minute.

591
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,153
Now Somerset's climbing
on the furniture.

592
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
Just wait a minute.

593
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,995
You're kidding me.

594
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,623
Call the Print Lab.

595
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,463
Oh, man.

596
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:22,971
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?

597
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,099
No.

598
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:30,979
MAN: I can tell you, guys, just by
looking at the swirl pattern...

599
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,773
...they're not the
victim's fingerprints.

600
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:48,496
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.

601
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,915
It doesn't fit.

602
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,461
- He doesn't wants us to help him stop.
- MILLS: Who knows?

603
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:58,631
So many freaks out there doing their
little evil deeds they don't wanna do.

604
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,885
"The voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it."

605
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,845
"Jodie Foster told me to do it."

606
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,599
You know, um, I've seen this baby take
as long as three days to make a match...

607
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:11,269
...so maybe you guys wanna cross
your fingers somewhere else.

608
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,521
(YAWNS)

609
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,358
You meant what you said to
Mrs. Gould, didn't you?

610
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,737
- About catching this guy.
- Yeah.

611
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,030
SOMERSET:
Hmm.

612
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,784
Wish I still thought the way you do.

613
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,705
Why don't you tell me what the hell
it is you think we're doing then.

614
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,333
Picking up the pieces.

615
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:39,339
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples.

616
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,466
Writing everything down.

617
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,302
Noting the time things happened.

618
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:48,556
- That's all?
- That's all.

619
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:52,769
Putting everything into neat
little piles and filing it away.

620
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:56,898
On the off chance it will ever
be needed in the courtroom.

621
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,362
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island.

622
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:06,074
Saving them in case
we get rescued.

623
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,578
MILLS:
Bullshit.

624
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,751
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

625
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:22,006
So many corpses roll
away unrevenged.

626
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:28,179
Don't try to tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

627
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,598
I saw you.

628
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,268
We're getting somewhere.

629
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,159
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

630
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,620
You've got a winner.

631
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:02,088
This guy goes by the name of Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

632
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,924
His prints were found
at the scene by Homicide.

633
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,553
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

634
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,890
His parents gave him a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

635
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,726
But somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

636
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,770
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

637
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:21,608
Spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor.

638
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,235
But his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.

639
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,988
His lawyer, by the way,
is the recently deceased Eli Gould.

640
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,835
- Greed murder victim.
- OFFICER: Yes, sir.

641
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,659
We're gonna finish this thing
up today, ladies and germs.

642
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,830
Victor's been out of circulation a while,
but there's still a residence in his name.

643
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,707
You're not buying all this,
are you?

644
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:41,836
- Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?
- You tell me.

645
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,505
Our killer seems to
have more purpose.

646
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,827
You ever take a bullet?

647
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,665
Never in my 34 years,
knock wood.

648
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:24,170
I've only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it.

649
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:25,672
Never pulled the trigger.

650
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,799
Not once.

651
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:29,050
You?

652
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:35,390
Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,
but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.

653
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,600
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

654
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,978
We were a secondary unit.

655
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,231
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie then.

656
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,693
Anyway, we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and, uh...

657
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,237
...the fucker just
opened fire on us.

658
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,197
One cop got hit in the arm.

659
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,451
Christ, what was his name?

660
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,788
Spun him like a top.

661
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,040
You know,
I mean, more like slow motion.

662
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,585
I remember...

663
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,088
...riding in that ambulance.

664
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,216
Well, he died right there.

665
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,427
Right there.

666
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,929
Christ, what was
his fucking name?

667
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,987
- OFFICER 1: All rise.
- OFFICER 2: Let's do it. Let's do it.

668
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:34,407
OFFICER 1:
Go, go, go. Move.

669
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,619
Okay.

670
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,307
OFFICER 3:
Get up there.

671
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,094
SWAT goes before dicks.

672
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,720
Hey.

673
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,099
They love this.

674
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,434
Police.

675
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,812
Clear.

676
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,524
- Clear.
- OFFICER: Clear.

677
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,900
Clear.

678
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:05,706
OFFICER 2:
Clear.

679
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,466
Morning, sweetheart.

680
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,885
Get up now, motherfucker.

681
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,345
Now!

682
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,439
Get up, you sack of shit.

684
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,739
Oh, fuck me.

685
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:43,077
Dicks, you'll wanna
come take a look at this.

686
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,498
Dicks!

687
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,213
Oof.

688
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,423
Jesus.

689
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,633
- Victor?
- MILLS: What the hell?

690
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,051
Yeah, it's just Victor.

691
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,179
- SOMERSET: Call an ambulance.
- OFFICER: What is this?

692
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,598
- CALIFORNIA: Hearse more like it.
- SOMERSET: Also Forensics.

693
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,084
- California, get your people out.
- CALIFORNIA: Go on now.

694

01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,726

a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:27,446
You're no different,
no better.

1198
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,407
I didn't say I was different
or better. I'm not.

1199
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:33,619
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1200
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:36,121
Apathy is a solution.

1201
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:40,918
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1202
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:43,128
- Yeah.
- It's easier to steal what you want...

1203
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,797
- ...than it is to earn it.
- Yeah.

1204
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,299
It's easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it.

1205
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,260
Hell, love costs.
It takes effort and work.

We are talking about

- No. No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1209
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:00,896

You can't afford to
be this naive.

1212
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:06,402
Fuck off.

1213
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:10,823
See, you should listen
to yourself. Yeah.

1214
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:14,660
You say that the problem
with people is that they don't care.

1215
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:17,496
So I don't care about people.

1216
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,373
It makes no sense.
You know why?

1217
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,834
Uh, you care?
You wanna know...?

1218
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,503
- Damn right.
- And you're gonna make a difference?

1219
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:28,966
Whatever, the point is, is that I
don't think you're quitting...

1220
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:32,344
...because you believe these things
you say. I don't.

1221
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:36,014
I think you wanna believe them
because you're quitting.

1222
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:41,103
You want me to agree and say,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right."

1223
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,230
"It's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess."

1224
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:46,817
"We should all go live
in a fucking log cabin."

1225
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:49,194
But I won't.

1226
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,488
I won't say that.

1227
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:55,742
I don't agree with you.
I do not.

1228
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,914
I can't.

1229
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,176
I'm gonna go home.

1230
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:21,560
Thank you, though.

1231
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:53,592
I love you, honey.

1232
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,220
So much.

01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,431

You see what he did?

1245
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:38,864
He sliced her up.

1246
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:40,949
Then he bandaged her.

1247
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,535
Call for help and you'll live.

1248
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:45,996

Cut off her nose.

01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:55,380
To spite her face.

1253
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,216

the tips of his fingers.

1282
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:43,405
That's why we couldn't find one
single usable print in his apartment.

1283
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:45,907
Looks like he's been doing it
for a quite sometime.

1284
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,493
MILLS: What about the
bank accounts? The guns?

1285
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,495
CAPTAIN: So far
everything's a dead end.

1286
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,415
No credit history.
No employment records.

1287
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:57,335
His bank account's only 5 years old
and it was started with cash.

1288
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,379
We're even trying
to trace his furniture.

1289
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:01,965
About only thing we know
about that guy right now...

1290
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:06,970
...is that he's independently wealthy,
well-educated and totally insane.

1291
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:09,139
Because he's John Doe
by choice.

1292
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:11,850
- Okay, so when do we get to question him?
- CAPTAIN: You don't.

1293

- He going to court now.
- MILLS: What?

1294
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:16,480
I'm telling you, there's no
way he'd turn himself in.

1295
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:18,273
It doesn't make any sense.

1296
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:22,027
Well, there he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1297

- He's not finished.
- No, he's pissing in our faces.

We're just taking it like idiots.
You know what I'm talking about.

1299
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:33,371
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1300
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:37,042
- He wouldn't just stop.
- MILLS: Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?

1301
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:40,420
SOMERSET: He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1302
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,924
We'll wait for his plea.

1303
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:51,640
My client says there are two more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1304
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:54,601
He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies...

1305
01:36:54,768 --> 01:36:58,939
...but only Detective Mills and
Somerset, only at 6:00 today.

1306
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:00,690
Why us?

1307
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,317
He says he admires you.

1308
01:37:04,069 --> 01:37:05,403
It's part of the game.

1309
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:08,323
The client claims if the
detectives do not accept this...

1310
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:12,410
...these bodies will never be found.
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1311
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,829
Hey.

1312
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,247
We've got him.

1313
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,624
Downstairs, locked up.
Done deal.

1314
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:20,836
He's gonna get his free room and
board, get his free cable TV.

1315
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:24,464
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we having this conversation?

1316
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:27,092
- Mills.
- No. Hey, something stinks.

1317
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:28,426

1318
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,264
Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face...

1319
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:34,516
...dealing for that shit,
I don't like it...

1320
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,182
Mills.

1321
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,435
I am required by law
to serve my clients...

1322
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,354
- ...to the best of my ability.
- Aw, Jesus.

1323
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:42,983
- To serve their best interest.
- We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1324
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,569
My client wishes inform you
if you do not accept...

1325
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:48,363
...he will plead insanity
across the board.

1326
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:50,198
TALBOT:
Let him try it.

1327
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:51,491
I'd like to see him try.

1328
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:54,661
Come on, now, we all know the
extreme nature of these crimes...

1329
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:57,247
...I could get him off
with such a plea.

1330
01:37:57,414 --> 01:38:00,125
I'm not letting this conviction
slide. I can tell you that.

1331
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:03,920
He says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions...

1332
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,715
...he'll sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1333
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,301
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1334
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,721
Full confession.

1335
01:38:12,888 --> 01:38:15,682
- I'm in.
- It has to be the both of you.

1336
01:38:17,142 --> 01:38:22,606
If he were to claim insanity,
this conversation is admissible.

1337
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:25,025
The fact that he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1338
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:27,819
And my client would like to
remind you two more are dead.

1339
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,487
Press would have a field day...

1340
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:32,616
...if they find out the police
didn't seem concerned about them.

1341
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:35,994
- Giving them a proper burial.
- If in fact there are two more dead.

1342
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:40,332
Lab report came up from downtown. They
did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.

1343
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:44,002
They found blood from Doe.
From him slicing his fingers.

1344
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:46,796
Blood from the woman
who's face he cut off.

1345
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:51,676
And blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.

1346
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:56,973
You'd be escorting an
unarmed man.

1347
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:01,478
Let's finish it.

1348
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:08,109
SOMERSET: If John Doe's head splits
open and a UFO should fly out...

1349
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,029
...I want you to
have expected it.

1350
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,366
I will.

1351
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,912
Hey, man, if I was to accidentally
shave off a nipple...

1352
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,705
...would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1353
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:21,873
Hmm.

1354
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,250
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1355
01:39:26,086 --> 01:39:28,171
I suppose so.

1356
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,382
- Yeah.
- If you were man enough...

1357
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:34,761
...to actually file a claim,
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1358
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,974
If I keep coming home late, my
wife's gonna think something's up.

01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:49,567

1461

that I'm here right now...

biding your time? Toying with me?

until you felt like springing your trap?

1494

Tell me, what was the indisputable
evidence you were going to use on me...

1495
01:48:57,615 --> 01:49:02,078

and put my hands in the air?

breaking your face.

Sit back.

1503

you look in the mirror...

1504
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:28,938
...at that face of yours
for the rest of your life...

1505
01:49:29,105 --> 01:49:30,773

for the rest...

those people.

at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1513
